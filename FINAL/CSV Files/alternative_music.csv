0,206436336,Paubaya,Moira Dela Torre,[20],['Alternative'],"Saan nagsimulang magbago ang lahat
Kailan nung ako'y 'di na naging sapat
Ba't di mo sinabi nung una pa lang
Ako ang kailangan, pero 'di ang mahal
Saan nagkulang ang aking pagmamahal
Lahat ay binigay nang mapangiti ka lang
Ba't 'di ko nakita na ayaw mo na
Ako ang kasama, pero hanap mo siya

At kung masaya ka sa piling niya
Hindi ko na pipilit pa
Ang tanging hiling ko lang sa kanya
'Wag kang paluhain
At alagaan ka niya

Saan natigil ang pagiging totoo
Sa tuwing mababanggit na mahal mo ako
Ba't 'di mo inamin na merong iba
Ako ang kayakap, pero isip mo siya

At kung masaya ka sa piling niya
Hindi ko na pipilit pa
Ang tanging hiling ko lang sakanya
'Wag kang paluhain, at alagaan ka niya
Ba't 'di ko naisip na merong hanggan
Ako yung nauna, pero siya ang wakas

At kita naman sa 'yong mga mata
Kung bakit pinili mo siya
Mahirap labanan ang tinadhana
Pinapaubaya
Pinapaubaya

Pinapaubaya ko na sa Kanya"

Esto va por los momentos que se fueron
Yo sé que no volverán
Y al tiempo perdido en mi vida es dedicado este refrán

Y mientras tanto la mente se pone en stop
No deja otra alternativa que consultarle al reloj
La pregunta de ¿Por qué si son más de las 2
Sigo despierto y me sigue atormentando aquella voz?
Dice:
Despierta, despierta ¡Hey despierta!
Que mientras tú sueñas hay niños en la calle y están más alertas
¡Despierta, hermano despierta!
Que mientras tú duermes la parca se aparca cerca de tu puerta
Y yo, me di una vuelta hoy en el barrio
Y el itinerario fueron noticias malas en el diario
Corruptos comisarios, títeres de empresarios
Los pobres comiendo cobre ¿Y aún existen millonarios?
En cada vecindario, cada lugar de la esfera
Es costumbre ver hombres caídos por las balaceras
Y aunque sé que desde el pasado pasa era por era
No pretendo ser esclavo de la voluntad ajena
Llámese ajeno a casi todo lo que vemos
Como los estudios, ropa, dinero, grandes terrenos
Incluso hasta lo que comemos
Viene de una industria a la cual, si no le pagamos, nos jodemos
Porque aquí la vida cuesta menos que un papel
Papel que hasta yo utilizo para escribir y eso me enoja
Porque al saber que aquel papel proviene de árboles, ¡Bah!
Siento que escribo en la tumba de alguna hoja
Hoy en día hay escaleras que suben por ti
Teclados que escriben por mí
Quizás cuerpos que duerman por ti ¡Sí!
Es fácil predecir la grave amenaza
Del final tecnológico de nuestra raza
Felicidad y conformismo son cosas distintas
Y de ser feliz con poco hermano no eres conformista
Eres una persona liberada
Que no es feliz teniendo todo sino no necesitando nada

Que rápido pasa el tiempo, aunque no se nota
Cada vez hay menos alimentos y más bocas
Menos salud y más coca, más frío, menos ropa
Menos paz y más tecnología de esa que explota
Es que el odio evoca del amor que se ha olvidado
Y el poder está en las manos de los menos indicados
Somos esclavos megos, víctimas del ego
Poder y no querer ver es ser más cobardes que ciegos
Y es que el juego de la libertad ya lo perdimos
Desde que decidimos vender la tierra que habitamos
Pues no notamos que la raíz en la que crecimos
Nos sigue dando frutos mientras la contaminamos
¡Vamos! Con el diálogo limamos asperezas
Debemos ser recíprocos con la naturaleza
Y acabar con esta estupidez inmensa
En donde caen mil árboles para levantar una empresa
De esas que sirven para fabricar dinero
Con la misma madera de los árboles que cayeron
Dinero que se gasta en bombonas de oxígeno
Oxígeno que era infinito en los bosques que destruyeron
Esto cambiará el día en que todos entiendan
Que la plata no alimenta
Que una planta vale más que millones en una cuenta repleta
Y una gota de agua más que todo el oro del planeta
Más que “Rap propuesta” es: -Poesía propuesta-
Y propongo quitar del camino los que nos afecta
Como el consumismo con su mismo ideal de clasismo
Y esta televisión que promueve el racismo
Felicidad y conformismo son cosas distintas
Y de ser feliz con poco hermano no eres conformista
Eres una persona liberada
Que no es feliz teniendo todo sino no necesitando nada
¡Yaoh!

Y en el entorno gélido de este frío de enero
Mi mente es un universo y yo soy solo un viajero
Y si mañana muero
Dile a mi vieja que la quiero
Y que mientras la espero le mando versos desde el cielo
Y en el entorno cálido que me susurra el alba
Mi mente es un avío buscando mares de calma
Y si vuela mi alma y la muerte toca mi puerta
Sepúltenme en una caja que tenga bombos cerca
¡Yaoh!

Cuna de raza suicida, autora de días grises
Quise un mar de fe cristalino espejo de sueños
Mar sin dueño, cuna de amor a su merced
Otorgué un árbol de vida y subastaron mis raíces
Oh hijos, mi destrucción causará su fin
Su ignorancia ha de ser el yugo de su ley
Su ignorancia ha de ser el yugo de su ley
Talaron su pulmón con ambición en forma de sierra
Dioses de la guerra y esclavos de su extinción
Teniendo pues el don de cuidar lo que en mí se anida
Hacedora de vida me llaman “Planeta Tierra”
Oh hijos, mi bendición será el fin de tu ambición
Para en un sol vernos resplandecientes cual araguaney
Vernos resplandecientes cual araguaney
Es BAYSTERZ
HORUS desde la tierra, ¡Carajo!"

Matatagpuan din kita

Na hinawakan ng mahigpit
At hinatak papalapit
Para lamang bitiwan at palayain

Hindi ko alam kung saan ako babagsak
Pero dinala ako ng tadhana sa bakurang ito
At naniniwala akong lahat ng bagay ay may dahilan
Dahil naniniwala ako sa Kanya
Sa may hawak ng tirador na pumuksa
Ng mga higante sa aking dibdib
Noong mga panahong wala pang lakas ang aking mga bisig
Pero ngayon, masasabi kong handa na ako
Handa na akong muling sumugal
Handa na akong muling magmahal
Handa na akong lumabas sa aking bangka
Kahit ilang beses na akong nagtangka at lumubog
At nalunod sa kasinungalingan na ang pag-asa
Ay isang pantasya na binubulag ako sa katotohanan
Alam kong ang katotohanang andito ka ngayon
Sa aking harapan ay hindi ko kagagawan
Pero sa wakas nahanap din kita
Dahil, ngayon handa na ako
At ang tanging panalangin na isinisigaw ko sa hangin
Ay sana ikaw rin

ROSS: Y-ello. No, Rachel's not here right now, can I take a message? Alright, and how do we spell Casey, is it like at the bat or and the Sunshine Band? OK, bye-bye. Hey, who's this uh, this Casey?
PHOEBE: Oh, some guy she met at the movies.

PHOEBE: Hang in there, it's gonna happen.
ROSS: Wha, OK, now how do you know that?
PHOEBE: Because she's your lobster.
CHANDLER: Oh, she's goin' somewhere.
PHOEBE: C'mon you guys. It's a known fact that lobsters fall in love and mate for life. You know what, you can actually see old lobster couples walkin' around their tank, ya know, holding claws like. . .

CHANDLER: Hey, you feelin' better?
MONICA: Yeah, I think that fifth shower actually got the interview off me.
PHOEBE: So, do you have any other possibilities?
MONICA: Oh yeah, well there's the possibility that I won't make rent.
ROSS: Monica, if you want, I can lend you some money.
MONICA: No no no, if I couldn't pay you back right away then I'd feel guilty and tense every time I saw you.
ROSS: Oh OK. Well then why don't you, uhh, why don't you borrow it from mom and dad? You feel guilty and tense around them already. You might as well make some money off of them.
CHANDLER: Ya know, the man's got a point. 
PHOEBE: What is that sparkly thing?
CHANDLER: That thing, it's a uhh. . . yeah it's, it's a little flashy.
ROSS: No no, no no, it's not flashy, not for a Goodfella.

MONICA: Hi.
MR. GELLER: Hi.
MRS. GELLER: Hi darling.
MONICA: So, what's this.
MR. GELLER: Some of your old stuff.
MRS. GELLER: Well sweetie, we have a surprise for you. We're turning your room into a gym.
MONICA: Wow, that is a surprise. Just one little question, uh, why not Ross's room?
MR. GELLER: Gosh, we talked about that but your brother has so many science trophies and plaques and merit badges, well we didn't want to disturb them.
MONICA: Oh, God forbid.

MRS. GELLER: Oh, hi Rachel.
RACHEL: Hi.
MRS. GELLER: Oh, we were so sorry to hear about your parents splitting up, dear.
RACHEL: Oh, well, you know, they're just separated so, you know, never know, we'll see.
MR. GELLER: Well, I can't say any of us were surprised. Your parents have been unhappy ever since we've known them. Especially after that incident in Hawaii.
RACHEL: What, what incident?
MR. GELLER: Uhh, naa, no no no, I, I must be thinking of someone else, uh, maybe me. Don't you have some folding to do? Go fold dear. Fold. You fold. 

PHOEBE: Do you want a refill?

GAIL: I'm Gail.

GAIL: I, I really have to be somewhere but it was nice meeting you.
CHANDLER: What?  Oh this is excellent. You know he coulda gotten me a VCR, he coulda gotten me a set of golf clubs, but no, he has to get me the woman repeller, the eyesore from the Liberace house of crap.
PHOEBE: It's not that bad.
CHANDLER: Oh, yeah, easy for you to say, you don't have to walk around sporting some reject from the Mr. T collection. 
PHOEBE: Chandler, Chandler.
CHANDLER: I pity the fool who puts on my jewelry, I do, I do. I pity the fool that. . .  Hi. Hey man, we were just doin' some uhh, impressions over here. Do your Marcel Marceau.  That's actually good.

PHOEBE: Do the claws again.
ROSS: Rach. OK, forget, forget the lobsters OK. We're, let's talk, what about us?
RACHEL: Ross, there is no us, OK.
ROSS: No, but. . .
RACHEL: No, listen to me. I fell for you and I get clobbered. You then fall for me and I again, somehow, get clobbered. I'm tired of being clobbered, ya know, it's, it's just not worth it.

JOEY: If you hated the bracelet so much, Chandler, you should have just said so.
CHANDLER: Well, doesn't the fact that I wore the bracelet even though I hated it say something about our friendship and how much it means to me?
JOEY: Well, what about the fact that you insulted the bracelet and you made fun of me?
CHANDLER: OK, well that's the part where I'm a wank. But I was hoping we wouldn't focus on that.  Hey, c'mon man, I said I was sorry like a hundred times, I promise I will never take it off my. . .  wrist. But if, if you want to stay in there and be mad, you know, you just uh, you stay in there. 
JOEY: You know what the. . . 
CHANDLER: I am here, on my knees, holding up these couch cushions as a symbol of my sorrow and regret, much like they did in biblical times. Though you may haveth anger now. . . 

MR. GELLER: You know, that Steffi Graf has quite a tush. I'm just saying, it's right there.
ROSS: Hey guys.
MRS. GELLER: Hi, darling. Where's my grandson, you didn't bring him?
ROSS: No, he's at uh, Carol's and Susan's today.
MR. GELLER: A woman in my office is a lesiban. I'm just saying.
MRS. GELLER: Oh, Jack look, there's that house paint commercial that cracks you up. 
MONICA: Where have you been?
ROSS: Emotional hell. So, did they lend you the money yet?
MONICA: No, but that's probably 'cause I haven't asked them yet.
ROSS: C'mon Monica, do it. Hey, you guys, um, Monica has some news.
MONICA: Um, yeah, so uh, uhh, listen, I'm sorry I didn't tell you this before but umm, I, I'm no longer at my job, I, I had to leave it.
MRS. GELLER: Why?
MONICA: Because they made me.
MRS. GELLER: You were fired? What're you gonna do?
MR. GELLER: Judy, Judy, relax, this is our little harmonica we're talking about. We taught her well. Ten percent of your paycheck, where does it go?
MONICA and ROSS: In the bank.
MR. GELLER: There you go. So she dips into her savings, that's what it's there for. She's gonna be fine, and if you need a little extra, you know where to find it. 
MONICA: Anything larger back there?

CHANDLER: I can't believe it.
PHOEBE: Would you stop already? Get out of the bitter barn and play in the hay.
CHANDLER: Oh, you're right I, I should play in the hay. Forget about the fact that I just dropped 400 dollars to replace a bracelet that I hated to begin with. Bring on the hay. 
RACHEL:  Hey. I've got something that's gonna make you happy. Guess what Gunther found? 
PHOEBE: Hey now you have two.  Oh, now you have two.
CHANDLER: What am I gonna do, huh? 
JOEY: Hey.
CHANDLER: Hey.
JOEY: How come you have two?
CHANDLER: Well this one's for you.
JOEY: Get out.
CHANDLER: No, I can't. No no, listen, I, I know how much this means to you and I also know that this is about more than just jewelry,  it's about you and me and the fact that we're  best buds.
JOEY: Wow, is this friendship? I think so. Check it out, we're bracelet buddies.
CHANDLER: That's what they'll call us.

ROSS: Here you go, you can pay me back whenever you like.
MONICA: You have dinosaur checks?

ROY: Oh, I'm gonna kick Chip's ass.

44,84383758,Lambing,Silent Sanctuary,"[1256, 20]","['Pinoy Pop', 'Alternative']","Hasan Of Bassorah.

There was once of days of yore and in ages and times long gone before, a merchant, who dwelt in the land of Bassorah and who owned two sons and wealth galore. But in due time Allah, the All-hearing the All-knowing, decreed that he should be admitted to the mercy of the Most High; so he died, and his two sons laid him out and buried him, after which they divided his gardens and estates equally between them and of his portion each one opened a shop. Presently the elder son, Hasan hight, a youth of passing beauty and loveliness, symmetry and perfect grace, betook himself to the company of lewd folk, women and low boys, frolicking with them in gardens and feasting them with meat and wine for months together and occupying himself not with his business like as his father had done, for that he exulted in the abundance of his good. After some time he had wasted all his ready money, so he sold all his father's lands and houses and played the wastrel until there remained in his hand nothing, neither little nor muchel, nor was one of his comrades left who knew him. He abode thus anhungred, he and his widowed mother, three days, and on the fourth day, as he walked along, unknowing whither to wend, there met him a man of his father's friends, who questioned him of his case. He told him what had befallen him and the other said, ""O my son, I have a brother who is a goldsmith; an thou wilt, thou shalt be with him and learn his craft and become skilled therein."" Hasan consented and accompanied him to his brother, to whom he commended him, saying, ""In very sooth this is my son; do thou teach him for my sake."" So Hasan abode with the goldsmith and busied himself with the craft; and Allah opened to him the door of gain and in due course he set up shop for himself. One day, as he sat in his booth in the bazar, there came up to him an Ajamí, a foreigner, a Persian, with a great white beard and a white turband on his head, having the semblance of a merchant who, after saluting him, looked at his handiwork and examined it knowingly. It pleased him and he shook his head, saying, ""By Allah, thou art a cunning goldsmith! What may be thy name?"" ""Hasan,"" replied the other, shortly. The Persian continued to look at his wares, whilst Hasan read in an old book he hent in hand and the folk were taken up with his beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace, till the hour of midafternoon prayer, when the shop became clear of people and the Persian accosted the young man, saying, ""O my son, thou art a comely youth! What book is that? Thou hast no sire and I have no son, and I know an art, than which there is no goodlier in the world.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Seventy-ninth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Persian accosted the young man saying, ""O my son, thou art a comely youth! Thou hast no sire and I have no son, and I know an art than which there is no goodlier in the world. Many have sought of me instruction therein, but I consented not to instruct any of them in it; yet hath my soul consented that I teach it to thee, for thy love hath gotten hold upon my heart and I will make thee my son and set up between thee and poverty a barrier, so shalt thou be quit of this handicraft and toil no more with hammer and anvil, charcoal and fire."" Hasan asked, ""O my lord and when wilt thou teach me this?""; and the Persian answered, ""To-morrow, Inshallah, I will come to thee betimes and make thee in thy presence fine gold of this copper."" Whereupon Hasan rejoiced and sat talking with the Persian till nightfall, when he took leave of him and going in to his mother, saluted her with the salam and ate with her; but he was dazed, without memory or reason, for that the stranger's words had gotten hold upon his heart. So she questioned him and he told her what had passed between himself and the Persian, which when she heard, her heart fluttered and she strained him to her bosom, saying, ""O my son, beware of hearkening to the talk of the folk, and especially of the Persians, and obey them not in aught; for they are sharpers and tricksters, who profess the art of alchemy and swindle people and take their money and devour it in vain."" Replied Hasan, ""O my mother, we are paupers and have nothing he may covet, that he should put a cheat on us. Indeed, this Persian is a right worthy Shaykh and the signs of virtue are manifest on him; Allah hath inclined his heart to me and he hath adopted me to son."" She was silent in her chagrin, and he passed the night without sleep, his heart being full of what the Persian had said to him; nor did slumber visit him for the excess of his joy therein. But when morning morrowed, he rose and taking the keys, opened the shop, whereupon behold, the Persian accosted him. Hasan stood up to him and would have kissed his hands; but he forbade him from this and suffered it not, saying, ""O Hasan, set on the crucible and apply the bellows."" So he did as the stranger bade him and lighted the charcoal. Then said the Persian, ""O my son, hast thou any copper?"" and he replied, ""I have a broken platter."" So he bade him work the shears and cut it into bittocks and cast it into the crucible and blow up the fire with the bellows, till the copper became liquid, when he put hand to turband and took therefrom a folded paper and opening it, sprinkled thereout into the pot about half a drachm of somewhat like yellow Kohl or eyepowder. Then he bade Hasan blow upon it with the bellows, and he did so, till the contents of the crucible became a lump of gold. When the youth saw this, he was stupefied and at his wits' end for the joy he felt and taking the ingot from the crucible handled it and tried it with the file and found it pure gold of the finest quality: whereupon his reason fled and he was dazed with excess of delight and bent over the Persian's hand to kiss it. But he forbade him, saying, ""Art thou married?"" and when the youth replied ""No!"" he said, ""Carry this ingot to the market and sell it and take the price in haste and speak not."" So Hasan went down into the market and gave the bar to the broker, who took it and rubbed it upon the touchstone and found it pure gold. So they opened the biddings at ten thousand dirhams and the merchants bid against one another for it up to fifteen thousand dirhams, at which price he sold it and taking the money, went home and told his mother all that had passed, saying, ""O my mother, I have learnt this art and mystery."" But she laughed at him, saying, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Eightieth Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith told his mother what he had done with the Ajami and cried, ""I have learnt this art and mystery,"" she laughed at him, saying, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!""; and she was silent for vexation. Then of his ignorance, he took a metal mortar and returning to the shop, laid it before the Persian, who was still sitting there and asked him, ""O my son, what wilt thou do with this mortar?"" Hasan answered, ""Let us put it in the fire, and make of it lumps of gold."" The Persian laughed and rejoined, ""O my son, art thou Jinn-mad that thou wouldst go down into the market with two ingots of gold in one day? Knowest thou not that the folk would suspect us and our lives would be lost? Now, O my son, an I teach thee this craft, thou must practise it but once in each twelvemonth; for that will suffice thee from year to year."" Cried Hasan, ""True, O my lord,"" and sitting down in his open shop, set on the crucible and cast more charcoal on the fire. Quoth the Persian, ""What wilt thou, O my son?""; and quoth Hasan, ""Teach me this craft."" ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!"" exclaimed the Persian, laughing; ""Verily, O my son, thou art little of wit and in nowise fitted for this noble craft. Did ever any during all his life learn this art on the beaten way or in the bazars? If we busy ourselves with it here, the folk will say of us, These practise alchemy; and the magistrates will hear of us, and we shall lose our lives. Wherefore, O my son, an thou desire to learn this mystery forthright, come thou with me to my house."" So Hasan barred his shop and went with that Ajamí; but by the way he remembered his mother's words and thinking in himself a thousand thoughts he stood still, with bowed head. The Persian turned and seeing him thus standing laughed and said to him, ""Art thou mad? What! I in my heart purpose thee good and thou misdoubtest I will harm thee!"" presently adding, ""But, if thou fear to go with me to my house, I will go with thee to thine and teach thee there."" Hasan replied, ""'Tis well, O uncle,"" and the Persian rejoined, ""Go thou before me."" So Hasan led the way to his own house, and entering, told his mother of the Persian's coming, for he had left him standing at the door. She ordered the house for them and when she had made an end of furnishing and adorning it, her son bade her go to one of the neighbours' lodgings. So she left her home to them and wended her way, whereupon Hasan brought in the Persian, who entered after asking leave. Then he took in hand a dish and going to the market, returned with food, which he set before the Persian, saying, ""Eat, O my lord, that between us there may be bread and salt and may Almighty Allah do vengeance upon the traitor to bread and salt!"" The Persian replied with a smile, ""True, O my son! Who knoweth the virtue and worth of bread and salt?"" Then he came forward and ate with Hasan, till they were satisfied; after which the Ajami said, ""O my son Hasan, bring us somewhat of sweetmeats."" So Hasan went to the market, rejoicing in his words, and returned with ten saucers of sweetmeats, of which they both ate and the Persian said, ""May Allah abundantly requite thee, O my son! It is the like of thee with whom folk company and to whom they discover their secrets and teach what may profit him!"" Then said he, ""O Hasan bring the gear."" But hardly did Hasan hear these words than he went forth like a colt let out to grass in spring-tide, and hastening to the shop, fetched the apparatus and set it before the Persian, who pulled out a piece of paper and said, ""O Hasan, by the bond of bread and salt, wert thou not dearer to me than my son, I would not let thee into the mysteries of this art, for I have none of the Elixir left save what is in this paper; but by and by I will compound the simples whereof it is composed and will make it before thee. Know, O my son Hasan, that to every ten pounds of copper thou must set half a drachm of that which is in this paper, and the whole ten will presently become unalloyed virgin gold;"" presently adding, ""O my son, O Hasan, there are in this paper three ounces, Egyptian measure, and when it is spent, I will make thee other and more."" Hasan took the packet and finding therein a yellow powder, finer than the first, said to the Persian, ""O my lord, what is the name of this substance and where is it found and how is it made?"" But he laughed, longing to get hold of the youth, and replied, ""Of what dost thou question? Indeed thou art a froward boy! Do thy work and hold thy peace."" So Hasan arose and fetching a brass platter from the house, shore it in shreds and threw it into the melting-pot; then he scattered on it a little of the powder from the paper and it became a lump of pure gold. When he saw this, he joyed with exceeding joy and was filled with amazement and could think of nothing save the gold; but, whilst he was occupied with taking up the lumps of metal from the melting-pot, the Persian pulled out of his turband in haste a packet of Cretan Bhang, which if an elephant smelt, he would sleep from night to night, and cutting off a little thereof, put it in a piece of the sweetmeat. Then said he, ""O Hasan, thou art become my very son and dearer to me than soul and wealth, and I have a daughter whose like never have eyes beheld for beauty and loveliness, symmetry and perfect grace. Now I see that thou befittest none but her and she none but thee; wherefore, if it be Allah's will, I will marry thee to her."" Replied Hasan, ""I am thy servant and whatso good thou dost with me will be a deposit with the Almighty!"" and the Persian rejoined, ""O my son, have fair patience and fair shall betide thee."" Therewith he gave him the piece of sweetmeat and he took it and kissing his hand, put it in his mouth, knowing not what was hidden for him in the after time for only the Lord of Futurity knoweth the Future. But hardly had he swallowed it, when he fell down, head foregoing heels, and was lost to the world; whereupon the Persian, seeing him in such calamitous case, rejoiced exceedingly and cried, ""Thou hast fallen into my snares, O gallows-carrion, O dog of the Arabs! This many a year have I sought thee and now I have found thee, O Hasan!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-first Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith ate the bit of sweetmeat given to him by the Ajami and fell fainting to the ground, the Persian rejoiced exceedingly and cried, ""This many a year have I sought thee and now I have found thee!"" Then he girt himself and pinioned Hasan's arms and binding his feet to his hands laid him in a chest, which he emptied to that end and locked it upon him. Moreover, he cleared another chest and laying therein all Hasan's valuables, together with the piece of the first gold-lump and the second ingot which he had made locked it with a padlock. Then he ran to the market and fetching a porter, took up the two chests and made off with them to a place within sight of the city, where he set them down on the sea-shore, hard by a vessel at anchor there. Now this craft had been freighted and fitted out by the Persian and her master was awaiting him; so, when the crew saw him, they came to him and bore the two chests on board. Then the Persian called out to the Rais or Captain, saying, ""Up and let us be off, for I have done my desire and won my wish."" So the skipper sang out to the sailors, saying, ""Weigh anchor and set sail!"" And the ship put out to sea with a fair wind. So far concerning the Persian; but as regards Hasan's mother, she awaited him till supper-time but heard neither sound nor news of him; so she went to the house and finding it thrown open, entered and saw none therein and missed the two chests and their valuables; wherefore she knew that her son was lost and that doom had overtaken him; and she buffeted her face and rent her raiment crying out and wailing and saying, ""Alas, my son, ah! Alas, the fruit of my vitals, ah!"" And she recited these couplets,
""My patience fails me and grows anxiety; * And with your absence
       &nbsp     growth of grief I see.
By Allah, Patience went what time ye went! * Loss of all Hope how
       &nbsp     suffer patiently?
When lost my loved one how can' joy I sleep? * Who shall enjoy
       &nbsp     such life of low degree?
Thou 'rt gone and, desolating house and home, * Hast fouled the
       &nbsp     fount erst flowed from foulness free:
Thou wast my fame, my grace 'mid folk, my stay; * Mine aid wast
       &nbsp     thou in all adversity!
Perish the day, when from mine eyes they bore * My friend, till
       &nbsp     sight I thy return to me!""
And she ceased not to weep and wail till the dawn, when the neighbours came in to her and asked her of her son, and she told them what had befallen him with the Persian, assured that she should never, never see him again. Then she went round about the house, weeping, and wending she espied two lines written upon the wall; so she sent for a scholar, who read them to her; and they were these,
""Leyla's phantom came by night, when drowsiness had overcome me,
       &nbsp     towards morning while my companions were sleeping in the
       &nbsp     desert,
But when we awoke to behold the nightly phantom, I saw the air
       &nbsp     vacant and the place of visitation was distant.""
When Hasan's mother heard these lines, she shrieked and said, ""Yes, O my son! Indeed, the house is desolate and the visitation-place is distant!"" Then the neighbours took leave of her and after they had prayed that she might be vouchsafed patience and speedy reunion with her son, went away; but she ceased not to weep all watches of the night and tides of the day and she built amiddlemost the house a tomb whereon she let write Hasan's name and the date of his loss, and thenceforward she quitted it not, but made a habit of incessantly biding thereby night and day. Such was her case; but touching her son Hasan and the Ajami, this Persian was a Magian, who hated Moslems with exceeding hatred and destroyed all who fell into his power. He was a lewd and filthy villain, a hankerer after alchemy, an astrologer and a hunter of hidden hoards, such an one as he of whom quoth the poet,
""A dog, dog-fathered, by dog-grandsire bred; * No good in dog
       &nbsp     from dog race issued:
E'en for a gnat no resting-place gives he * Who is composed of
       &nbsp     seed by all men shed.""
The name of this accursed was Bahrám the Guebre, and he was wont, every year, to take a Moslem and cut his throat for his own purposes. So, when he had carried out his plot against Hasan the goldsmith, they sailed on from dawn till dark, when the ship made fast to the shore for the night, and at sunrise, when they set sail again, Bahram bade his black slaves and white servants bring him the chest wherein were Hasan. They did so, and he opened it and taking out the young man, made him sniff up vinegar and blew a powder into his nostrils. Hasan sneezed and vomited the Bhang; then, opening his eyes, he looked about him right and left and found himself amiddleward the sea on aboard a ship in full sail, and saw the Persian sitting by him; wherefore he knew that the accursed Magian had put a cheat on him and that he had fallen into the very peril against which his mother had warned him. So he spake the saying which shall never shame the sayer, to wit, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verity, we are Allah's and unto Him we are returning! O my God, be Thou gracious to me in Thine appointment and give me patience to endure this Thine affliction, O Lord of the three Worlds!"" Then he turned to the Persian and bespoke him softly, saying, ""O my father, what fashion is this and where is the covenant of bread and salt and the oath thou swarest to me?"" But Bahram stared at him and replied, ""O dog, knoweth the like of me bond of bread and salt? I have slain of youths like thee a thousand, save one, and thou shalt make up the thousand."" And he cried out at him and Hasan was silent, knowing that the Fate-shaft had shot him.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-second Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan beheld himself fallen into the hands of the damned Persian he bespoke him softly but gained naught thereby for the Ajami cried out at him in wrath, so he was silent, knowing that the Fate-shaft had shot him. Then the accursed bade loose his pinion-bonds and they gave him a little water to drink, whilst the Magian laughed and said, ""By the virtue of the Fire and the Light and the Shade and the Heat, methought not thou wouldst fall into my nets! But the Fire empowered me over thee and helped me to lay hold upon thee, that I might win my wish and return and make thee a sacrifice, to her so she may accept of me."" Quoth Hasan, ""Thou hast foully betrayed bread and salt""; whereupon the Magus raised his hand and dealt him such a buffet that he fell and, biting the deck with his fore-teeth, swooned away, whilst the tears trickled down his cheeks. Then the Guebre bade his servants light him a fire and Hasan said, ""What wilt thou do with it?"" Replied the Magian, ""This is the Fire, lady of light and sparkles bright! This it is I worship, and if thou wilt worship her even as I, verily I will give thee half my monies and marry thee to my maiden daughter."" Thereupon Hasan cried angrily at him, ""Woe to thee! Thou art a miscreant Magian who to Fire dost pray in lieu of the King of Omnipotent sway, Creator of Night and Day; and this is naught but a calamity among creeds!"" At this the Magian was wroth and said to him, ""Wilt thou not then conform with me, O dog of the Arabs, and enter my faith?"" But Hasan consented not to this: so the accursed Guebre arose and prostrating himself to the fire, bade his pages throw him flat on his face. They did so, and he beat him with a hide whip of plaited thongs till his flanks were laid open, whilst he cried aloud for aid but none aided him, and besought protection, but none protected him. Then he raised his eyes to the All-powerful King and sought of Him succour in the name of the Chosen Prophet. And indeed patience failed him; his tears ran down his cheeks, like rain, and he repeated these couplets twain,
""In patience, O my God, Thy doom forecast * I'll bear, an thereby
       &nbsp     come Thy grace at last:
They've dealt us wrong, transgressed and ordered ill; * Haply Thy
       &nbsp    Grace shall pardon what is past.""
Then the Magian bade his negro-slaves raise him to a sitting posture and bring him somewhat of meat and drink. So they sat food before him; but he consented not to eat or drink; and Bahram ceased not to torment him day and night during the whole voyage, whilst Hasan took patience and humbled himself in supplication before Almighty Allah to whom belong Honour and Glory; whereby the Guebre's heart was hardened against him. They ceased not to sail the sea three months, during which time Hasan was continually tortured till Allah Almighty sent forth upon them a foul wind and the sea grew black and rose against the ship, by reason of the fierce gale; whereupon quoth the captain and crew, ""By Allah, this is all on account of yonder youth, who hath been these three months in torture with this Magian. Indeed, this is not allowed of God the Most High."" Then they rose against the Magian and slew his servants and all who were with him; which when he saw, he made sure of death and feared for himself. So he loosed Hasan from his bonds and pulling off the ragged clothes the youth had on, clad him in others; and made excuses to him and promised to teach him the craft and restore him to his native land, saying, ""O my son, return me not evil for that I have done with thee."" Quoth Hasan, ""How can I ever rely upon thee again?""; and quoth Bahram, ""O my son, but for sin, there were no pardon. Indeed, I did all these doings with thee, but to try thy patience, and thou knowest that the case is altogether in the hands of Allah."" So the crew and captain rejoiced in Hasan's release, and he called down blessings on them and praised the Almighty and thanked Him. With this the wind was stilled and the sky cleared and with a fair breeze they continued their voyage. Then said Hasan to Bahram, ""O Master, whither wendest thou?"" Replied the Magian, ""O, my son, I am bound for the Mountain of Clouds, where is the Elixir which we use in alchemy."" And the Guebre swore to him by the Fire and the Light that he had no longer any cause to fear him. So Hasan's heart was set at ease and rejoicing at the Persian's words, he continued to eat and drink and sleep with the Magian, who clad him in his own raiment. They ceased not sailing on other three months, when the ship came to anchor off a long shoreline of many coloured pebbles, white and yellow and sky-blue and black and every other hue, and the Magian sprang up and said, ""O Hasan, come, let us go ashore for we have reached the place of our wish and will."" So Hasan rose and landed with Bahram, after the Persian had commended his goods to the captain's care. They walked on inland, till they were far enough from the ship to be out of sight, when Bahram sat down and taking from his pocket a kettle-drum of copper and a silken strap, worked in gold with characts, beat the drum with the strap, until there arose a cloud of dust from the further side of the waste. Hasan marvelled at the Magian's doings and was afraid of him: he repented of having come ashore with him and his colour changed. But Bahram looked at him and said, ""What aileth thee, O my son? By the truth of the Fire and the Light, thou hast naught to fear from me; and, were it not that my wish may never be won save by thy means, I had not brought thee ashore. So rejoice in all good; for yonder cloud of dust is the dust of somewhat we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and make easy to us the hardships thereof.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-third Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Persian said to Hasan, ""In very sooth yonder dust-cloud is the cloud of something we will mount and which will aid us to cut across this wold and will make easy to us the hardships thereof."" Presently the dust lifted off three she-dromedaries, one of which Bahram mounted and Hasan another. Then they loaded their victual on the third and fared on seven days, till they came to a wide champaign and, descending into its midst, they saw a dome vaulted upon four pilasters of red gold; so they alighted and entering thereunder, ate and drank and took their rest. Anon Hasan chanced to glance aside and seeing from afar a something lofty said to the Magian, ""What is that, O nuncle?"" Bahram replied, ""'Tis a palace,"" and quoth Hasan, ""Wilt thou not go thither, that we may enter and there repose ourselves and solace ourselves with inspecting it?"" But the Persian was wroth and said, ""Name not to me yonder palace; for therein dwelleth a foe, with whom there befel me somewhat whereof this is no time to tell thee."" Then he beat the kettle-drum and up came the dromedaries, and they mounted and fared on other seven days. On the eighth day, the Magian said, ""O Hasan, what seest thou?"" Hasan replied, ""I see clouds and mists twixt east and west."" Quoth Bahram, ""That is neither clouds nor mists, but a vast mountain and a lofty whereon the clouds split, and there are no clouds above it, for its exceeding height and surpassing elevation. Yon mount is my goal and thereon is the need we seek. 'Tis for that I brought thee hither, for my wish may not be won save at thy hands. Hasan hearing this gave his life up for lost and said to the Magian, ""By the right of that thou worshippest and by the faith wherein thou believest, I conjure thee to tell me what is the object wherefor thou hast brought me!"" Bahram replied, ""The art of alchemy may not be accomplished save by means of a herb which groweth in the place where the clouds pass and whereon they split. Such a site is yonder mountain upon whose head the herb groweth and I purpose to send thee up thither to fetch it; and when we have it, I will show thee the secret of this craft which thou desirest to learn."" Hasan answered, in his fear, ""'Tis well, O my master;"" and indeed he despaired of life and wept for his parting from his parent and people and patrial stead, repenting him of having gainsaid his mother and reciting these two couplets,
""Consider but thy Lord, His work shall bring * Comfort to thee,
       &nbsp   with quick relief and near:
Despair not when thou sufferest sorest bane: * In bane how many
       &nbsp   blessed boons appear!""
They ceased not faring on till they came to the foothills of that mountain where they halted; and Hasan saw thereon a palace and asked Bahram, ""What be yonder palace?""; whereto he answered, ""'Tis the abode of the Jann and Ghuls and Satans."" Then the Magian alighted and making Hasan also dismount from his dromedary kissed his head and said to him, ""Bear me no ill will anent that I did with thee, for I will keep guard over thee in thine ascent to the palace; and I conjure thee not to trick and cheat me of aught thou shalt bring therefrom; and I and thou will share equally therein."" And Hasan replied, ""To hear is to obey."" Then Bahram opened a bag and taking out a handmill and a sufficiency of wheat, ground the grain and kneaded three round cakes of the flour; after which he lighted a fire and baked the bannocks. Then he took out the copper kettledrum and beat it with the broidered strap, whereupon up came the dromedaries. He chose out one and said, ""Hearken, O my son, O Hasan, to what I am about to enjoin on thee;"" and Hasan replied, ""'Tis well."" Bahram continued, ""Lie down on this skin and I will sew thee up therein and lay thee on the ground; whereupon the Rakham birds will come to thee and carry thee up to the mountain-top. Take this knife with thee; and, when thou feelest that the birds have done flying and have set thee down, slit open therewith the skin and come forth. The vultures will then take fright at thee and fly away; whereupon do thou look down from the mountain head and speak to me, and I will tell thee what to do."" So he sewed him up in the skin, placing therein three cakes and a leathern bottle full of water, and withdrew to a distance. Presently a vulture pounced upon him and taking him up, flew away with him to the mountain-top and there set him down. As soon as Hasan felt himself on the ground, he slit the skin and coming forth, called out to the Magian, who hearing his speech rejoiced and danced for excess of joy, saying to him, ""Look behind thee and tell me what thou seest."" Hasan looked and seeing many rotten bones and much wood, told Bahram, who said to him, ""This be what we need and seek. Make six bundles of the wood and throw them down to me, for this is wherewithal we do alchemy."" So he threw him the six bundles and when he had gotten them into his power he said to Hasan, ""O gallows bird, I have won my wish of thee; and now, if thou wilt, thou mayst abide on this mountain, or cast thyself down to the earth and perish. So saying, he left him and went away, and Hasan exclaimed, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This hound hath played the traitor with me."" And he sat bemoaning himself and reciting these couplets,
""When God upon a man possessed of reasoning, Hearing and sight
       &nbsp   His will in aught to pass would bring,
He stops his ears and blinds his eyes and draws his wit, From
       &nbsp    him, as one draws out the hairs to paste that cling;
Till, His decrees fulfilled, He gives him back His wit, That
       &nbsp   therewithal he may receive admonishing.
So say thou not of aught that haps, 'How happened it?' For Fate
       &nbsp    and fortune fixed do order everything.""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-fourth Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Magian sent Hasan to the mountain-top and made him throw down all he required he presently reviled him and left him and wended his ways and the youth exclaimed, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This damned hound hath played the traitor."" Then he rose to his feet and looked right and left, after which he walked on along the mountain top, in mind making certain of death. He fared on thus till he came to the counterslope of the mountain, along which he saw a dark-blue sea, dashing with billows clashing and yeasting waves each as it were a lofty mount. So he sat down and repeated what he might of the Koran and besought Allah the Most High to ease him of his troubles, or by death or by deliverance from such strait. Then he recited for himself the funeral-prayer and cast himself down into the main; but, the waves bore him up by Allah's grace, so that he reached the water unhurt, and the angel in whose charge is the sea watched over him, so that the billows bore him safe to land, by the decree of the Most High. Thereupon he rejoiced and praised Almighty Allah and thanked Him; after which he walked on in quest of something to eat, for stress of hunger, and came presently to the place where he had halted with the Magian, Bahram. Then he fared on awhile, till behold, he caught sight of a great palace, rising high in air, and knew it for that of which he had questioned the Persian and he had replied, ""Therein dwelleth a foe, of mine."" Hasan said to himself, ""By Allah, needs must I enter yonder palace; perchance relief awaiteth me there."" So coming to it and finding the gate open, he entered the vestibule, where he saw seated on a bench two girls like twin moons with a chess-cloth before them and they were at play. One of them raised her head to him and cried out for joy saying, ""By Allah, here is a son of Adam, and methinks 'tis he whom Bahram the Magian brought hither this year!"" So Hasan hearing her words cast himself at their feet and wept with sore weeping and said, ""Yes, O my ladies, by Allah, I am indeed that unhappy."" Then said the younger damsel to her elder sister, ""Bear witness against me, O my sister, that this is my brother by covenant of Allah and that I will die for his death and live for his life and joy for his joy and mourn for his mourning."" So saying, she rose and embraced him and kissed him and presently taking him by the hand and her sister with her, led him into the palace, where she did off his ragged clothes and brought him a suit of King's raiment wherewith she arrayed him. Moreover, she made ready all manner viands and set them before him, and sat and ate with him, she and her sister. Then said they to him, ""Tell us thy tale with yonder dog, the wicked, the wizard, from the time of thy falling into his hands to that of thy freeing thee from him; and after we will tell thee all that hath passed between us and him, so thou mayst be on thy guard against him an thou see him again."" Hearing these words and finding himself thus kindly received, Hasan took heart of grace and reason returned to him and he related to them all that had befallen him with the Magian from first to last. Then they asked, ""Didst thou ask him of this palace?""; and he answered, ""Yes, but he said, 'Name it not to me; for it belongeth to Ghuls and Satans.'"" At this, the two damsels waxed wroth with exceeding wrath and said, ""Did that miscreant style us Ghuls and Satans?"" And Hasan answered, ""Yes."" Cried the younger sister, ""By Allah, I will assuredly do him die with the foulest death and make him to lack the wind of the world!"" Quoth Hasan, ""And how wilt thou get at him, to kill him, for he is a crafty magician?""; and quoth she, ""He is in a garden by name Al-Mushayyad, and there is no help but that I slay him before long."" Then said her sister, ""Sooth spake Hasan in everything he hath recounted to us of this cur; but now tell him our tale, that all of it may abide in his memory."" So the younger said to him, ""Know, O my brother, that we are the daughters of a King of the mightiest Kings of the Jann, having Marids for troops and guards and servants, and Almighty Allah blessed him with seven daughters by one wife; but of his folly such jealousy and stiff-neckedness and pride beyond compare gat hold upon him that he would not give us in marriage to any one and, summoning his Wazirs and Emirs, he said to them, 'Can ye tell me of any place untrodden by the tread of men and Jinn and abounding in trees and fruits and rills?' And quoth they, 'What wilt thou therewith, O King of the Age?' And quoth he, 'I desire there to lodge my seven daughters.' Answered they, 'O King, the place for them is the Castle of the Mountain of Clouds, built by an Ifrit of the rebellious Jinn, who revolted from the covenant of our lord Solomon, on whom be the peace! Since his destruction, none hath dwelt there, nor man nor Jinni, for 'tis cut off and none may win to it. And the Castle is girt about with trees and fruits and rills, and the water running around it is sweeter than honey and colder than snow: none who is afflicted with leprosy or elephantiasis or what not else drinketh thereof but he is healed forthright. Hearing this our father sent us hither, with an escort of his troops and guards and provided us with all that we need here. When he is minded to ride to us he beateth a kettle-drum, whereupon all his hosts present themselves before him and he chooseth whom he shall ride and dismisseth the rest; but, when he desireth that we shall visit him, he commandeth his followers, the enchanters, to fetch us and carry us to the presence; so he may solace himself with our society and we accomplish our desire of him; after which they again carry us back hither. Our five other sisters are gone a-hunting in our desert, wherein are wild beasts past compt or calculation and, it being our turn to do this we two abode at home, to make ready for them food. Indeed, we had besought Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) to vouchsafe us a son of Adam to cheer us with his company and praised be He who hath brought thee to us! So be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear, for no harm shall befal thee."" Hasan rejoiced and said, ""Alhamdolillah, laud to the Lord who guideth us into the path of deliverance and inclineth hearts to us!"" Then his sister rose and taking him by the hand, led him into a private chamber, where she brought out to him linen and furniture that no mortal can avail unto. Presently, the other damsels returned from hunting and birding and their sisters acquainted them with Hasan's case; whereupon they rejoiced in him and going into him in his chamber, saluted him with the salam and gave him joy of his safety. Then he abode with them in all the solace of life and its joyance, riding out with them to the chase and taking his pleasure with them whilst they entreated him courteously and cheered him with converse, till his sadness ceased from him and he recovered health and strength and his body waxed stout and fat, by dint of fair treatment and pleasant time among the seven moons in that fair palace with its gardens and flowers; for indeed he led the delightsomest of lives with the damsels who delighted in him and he yet more in them. And they used to give him drink of the honey-dew of their lips these beauties with the high bosoms, adorned with grace and loveliness, the perfection of brilliancy and in shape very symmetry. Moreover the youngest Princess told her sisters how Bahram the Magian had made them of the Ghuls and Demons and Satans, and they sware that they would surely slay him. Next year the accursed Guebre again made his appearance, having with him a handsome young Moslem, as he were the moon, bound hand and foot and tormented with grievous tortures, and alighted with him below the palace-walls. Now Hasan was sitting under the trees by the side of the stream; and when he espied Bahram, his heart fluttered, his hue changed and he smote hand upon hand.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-fifth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith saw the Magian, his heart fluttered, his hue changed and he smote hand upon hand. Then he said to the Princesses, ""O my sisters, help me to the slaughter of this accursed, for here he is come back and in your grasp, and he leadeth with him captive a young Moslem of the sons of the notables, whom he is torturing with all manner grievous torments. Lief would I kill him and console my heart of him; and, by delivering the young Moslem from his mischief and restoring him to his country and kith and kin and friends, fain would I lay up merit for the world to come, by taking my wreak of him. This will be an almsdeed from you and ye will reap the reward thereof from Almighty Allah."" ""We hear and we obey Allah and thee, O our brother, O Hasan,"" replied they and binding chin-veils, armed themselves and slung on their swords: after which they brought Hasan a steed of the best and equipped him in panoply and weaponed him with goodly weapons. Then they all sallied out and found the Magian who had slaughtered and skinned a camel, ill-using the young Moslem, and saying to him, ""Sit thee in this hide."" So Hasan came behind him, without his knowledge, and cried out at him till he was dazed and amazed. Then he came up to him, saying, ""Hold thy hand, O accursed! O enemy of Allah and foe of the Moslems! O dog! O traitor! O thou that flame dost obey! O thou that walkest in the wicked ones' ways, worshipping the fire and the light and swearing by the shade and the heat!"" Herewith the Magian turned and seeing Hasan, thought to wheedle him and said to him, ""O my son, how diddest thou escape and who brought thee down to earth?"" Hasan replied, ""He delivered me, who hath appointed the taking of thy life to be at my hand, and I will torture thee even as thou torturedst me the whole way long. O miscreant, O atheist, thou hast fallen into the twist and the way thou hast missed; and neither mother shall avail thee nor brother, nor friend nor solemn covenant shall assist thee; for thou saidst, O accursed, Whoso betrayeth bread and salt, may Allah do vengeance upon him! And thou hast broken the bond of bread and salt; wherefore the Almighty hath thrown thee into my grasp, and far is thy chance of escape from me."" Rejoined Bahram, ""By Allah, O my son, O Hasan, thou art dearer to me than my sprite and the light of mine eyes!"" But Hasan stepped up to him and hastily smote him between the shoulders, that the sword issued gleaming from his throat-tendons and Allah hurried his soul to the fire, and abiding-place dire. Then Hasan took the Magian's bag and opened it, then having taken out the kettle-drum he struck it with the strap, whereupon up came the dromedaries like lightning. So he unbound the youth from his bonds and setting him on one of the camels, loaded him another with victual and water, saying, ""Wend whither thou wilt."" So he departed, after Almighty Allah had thus delivered him from his strait at the hands of Hasan. When the damsels saw their brother slay the Magian they joyed in him with exceeding joy and gat round him, marvelling at his valour and prowess, and thanked him for his deed and gave him joy of his safety, saying, ""O Hasan thou hast done a deed, whereby thou hast healed the burning of him that thirsteth for vengeance and pleased the King of Omnipotence!"" Then they returned to the palace, and he abode with them, eating and drinking and laughing and making merry; and indeed his sojourn with them was joyous to him and he forgot his mother; but while he led with them this goodly life one day, behold, there arose from the further side of the desert a great cloud of dust that darkened the welkin and made towards them. When the Princess saw this, they said to him, ""Rise, O Hasan, run to thy chamber and conceal thyself; or an thou wilt, go down into the garden and hide thyself among the trees and vines; but fear not, for no harm shall befal thee."" So he arose and entering his chamber, locked the door upon himself, and lay lurking in the palace. Presently the dust opened out and showed beneath it a great conquering host, as it were a surging sea, coming from the King, the father of the damsels. Now when the troops reached the castle, the Princesses received them with all honour and hospitably entertained them three days; after which they questioned them of their case and tidings and they replied saying, ""We come from the King in quest of you."" They asked, ""And what would the King with us?""; and the officers answered, ""One of the Kings maketh a marriage festival, and your father would have you be present thereat and take your pleasure therewith."" The damsels enquired, ""And how long shall we be absent from our place?""; and they rejoined, ""The time to come and go, and to sojourn may be two months."" So the Princesses arose and going in to the palace sought Hasan, acquainted him with the case and said to him, ""Verily this place is thy place and our house is thy house; so be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear and feel nor grief nor fear, for none can come at thee here; but keep a good heart and a glad mind, till we return to thee. The keys of our chambers we leave with thee; but, O our brother, we beseech thee, by the bond of brotherhood, in very deed not to open such a door, for thou hast no need thereto."" Then they farewelled him and fared forth with the troops, leaving Hasan alone in the palace. It was not long before his breast grew straitened and his patience shortened: solitude and sadness were heavy on him and he sorrowed for his severance from them with passing chagrin. The palace for all its vastness, waxed small to him and finding himself sad and solitary, he bethought him of the damsels and their pleasant converse and recited these couplets,
""The wide plain is narrowed before these eyes * And the landscape
       &nbsp     troubles this heart of mine.
Since my friends went forth, by the loss of them * Joy fled and
       &nbsp     these eyelids rail floods of brine:
Sleep shunned these eyeballs for parting woe * And my mind is
       &nbsp    worn with sore pain and pine:
Would I wot an Time shall rejoin our lots * And the joys of love
       &nbsp    with night-talk combine.""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-sixth Night,
She said, it hath reached me, O auspicious King, that after the departure of the damsels, Hasan sat in the palace sad and solitary and his breast was straitened by severance. He used to ride forth a-hunting by himself in the wold and bring back the game and slaughter it and eat thereof alone: but melancholy and disquiet redoubled on him, by reason of his loneliness. So he arose and went round about the palace and explored its every part; he opened the Princesses' apartments and found therein riches and treasures fit to ravish the beholder's reason; but he delighted not in aught thereof, by reason of their absence. His heart was fired by thinking of the door they had charged him not to approach or open on any account and he said in himself, ""My sister had never enjoined me not to open this door, except there were behind it somewhat whereof she would have none to know; but, by Allah, I will arise and open it and see what is within, though within it were sudden death!"" Then he took the key and, opening the door, saw therein no treasure but he espied a vaulted and winding staircase of Yamani onyx at the upper end of the chamber. So he mounted the stair, which brought him out upon the terrace- roof of the palace, whence he looked down upon the gardens and vergiers, full of trees and fruits and beasts and birds warbling praises of Allah, the One, the All-powerful; and said in himself ""This is that they forbade to me."" He gazed upon these pleasaunces and saw beyond a surging sea, dashing with clashing billows, and he ceased not to explore the palace right and left, till he ended at a pavilion builded with alternate courses, two bricks of gold and one of silver and jacinth and emerald and supported by four columns. And in the centre he saw a sitting- room paved and lined with a mosaic of all manner precious stones such as rubies and emeralds and balasses and other jewels of sorts; and in its midst stood a basin brimful of water, over which was a trellis-work of sandalwood and aloes-wood reticulated with rods of red gold and wands of emerald and set with various kinds of jewels and fine pearls, each sized as a pigeon's egg. The trellis was covered with a climbing vine, bearing grapes like rubies, and beside the basin stood a throne of lign-aloes latticed with red gold, inlaid with great pearls and comprising vari-coloured gems of every sort and precious minerals each kind fronting each and symmetrically disposed. About it the birds warbled with sweet tongues and various voices celebrating the praises of Allah the Most High: brief, it was a palace such as nor Cæsar nor Chosroës ever owned; but Hasan saw therein none of the creatures of Allah, whereat he marvelled and said in himself, ""I wonder to which of the Kings this place pertaineth, or is it Many-Columned Iram whereof they tell, for who among mortals can avail to the like of this?"" And indeed he was amazed at the spectacle and sat down in the pavilion and cast glances around him marvelling at the beauty of its ordinance and at the lustre of the pearls and jewels and the curious works which therein were, no less than at the gardens and orchards aforesaid and at the birds that hymned the praises of Allah, the One, the Almighty; and he abode pondering the traces of him whom the Most High had enabled to rear that structure, for indeed He is muchel of might. And presently, behold, he espied ten birds flying towards the pavilion from the heart of the desert and knew that they were making the palace and bound for the basin, to drink of its waters: so he hid himself, for fear they should see him and take flight. They lighted on a great tree and a goodly and circled round about it; and he saw amongst them a bird of marvel-beauty, the goodliest of them all, and the nine stood around it and did it service; and Hasan marvelled to see it peck them with its bill and lord it over them while they fled from it. He stood gazing at them from afar as they entered the pavilion and perched on the couch; after which each bird rent open its neck-skin with its claws and issued out of it; and lo! it was but a garment of feathers, and there came forth therefrom ten virgins, maids whose beauty shamed the brilliancy of the moon. They all doffed their clothes and plunging into the basin, washed and fell to playing and sporting one with other; whilst the chief bird of them lifted up the rest and ducked them down and they fled from her and dared not put forth their hands to her. When Hasan beheld her thus he took leave of his right reason and his sense was enslaved, so he knew that the Princesses had not forbidden him to open the door save because of this; for he fell passionately in love with her, for what he saw of her beauty and loveliness, symmetry and perfect grace, as she played and sported and splashed the others with the water. He stood looking upon them whilst they saw him not, with eye gazing and heart burning and soul to evil prompting; and he sighed to be with them and wept for longing, because of the beauty and loveliness of the chief damsel. His mind was amazed at her charms and his heart taken in the net of her love; lowe was loosed in his heart for her sake and there waxed on him a flame, whose sparks might not be quenched, and desire, whose signs might not be hidden. Presently, they came up out of that basin, whilst Hasan marvelled at their beauty and loveliness and the tokens of inner gifts in the elegance of their movements. Then he cast a glance at the chief damsel who stood mother- naked and there was manifest to him what was between her thighs a goodly rounded dome on pillars borne, like a bowl of silver or crystal, which recalled to him the saying of the poet,
""When I took up her shift and discovered the terrace-roof of her
       &nbsp     kaze, I found it as strait as my humour or eke my worldly
       &nbsp     ways:
So I thrust it, incontinent, in, halfway, and she heaved a sigh.
       &nbsp    'For what dost thou sigh?' quoth I. 'For the rest of it
       &nbsp    sure,' she says.""
Then coming out of the water they all put on their dresses and ornaments, and the chief maiden donned a green dress, wherein she surpassed for loveliness all the fair ones of the world and the lustre of her face outshone the resplendent full moons: she excelled the branches with the grace of her bending gait and confounded the wit with apprehension of disdain; and indeed she was as saith the poet,
""A maiden 'twas, the dresser's art had decked with cunning
       &nbsp    sleight;
The sun thou 'd'st say had robbed her cheek and shone with
       &nbsp    borrowed light.
She came to us apparelled fair in under vest of green,
Like as the ripe pomegranate hides beneath its leafy screen;
And when we asked her what might be the name of what she wore,
She answered in a quaint reply that double meaning bore:
The desert's heart we penetrate in such apparel dressed,
And Pierce-heart therefore is the name by which we call the
       &nbsp     vest.""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-seventh Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan saw the damsels issue forth the basin, the chief maiden robbed his reason with her beauty and loveliness compelling him to recite the couplets forequoted. And after dressing they sat talking and laughing, whilst he stood gazing on them, drowned in the sea of his love, burning in the flames of passion and wandering in the Wady of his melancholy thought. And he said to himself, ""By Allah, my sister forbade me not to open the door, but for cause of these maidens and for fear lest I should fall in love with one of them! How, O Hasan shalt thou woo and win them? How bring down a bird flying in the vasty firmament? By Allah thou hast cast thyself into a bottomless sea and snared thyself in a net whence there is no escape! I shall die desolate and none shall wot of my death."" And he continued to gaze on the charms of the chief damsel, who was the loveliest creature Allah had made in her day, and indeed she outdid in beauty all human beings. She had a mouth magical as Solomon's seal and hair blacker than the night of estrangement to the love-despairing man; her brow was bright as the crescent moon of the Feast of Ramazán and her eyes were like eyes wherewith gazelles scan; she had a polished nose straight as a cane and cheeks like blood-red anemones of Nu'uman, lips like coralline and teeth like strung pearls in carcanets of gold virgin to man, and a neck like an ingot of silver, above a shape like a wand of Bán: her middle was full of folds, a dimpled plain such as enforceth the distracted lover to magnify Allah and extol His might and main, and her navel an ounce of musk, sweetest of savour could contain: she had thighs great and plump, like marble columns twain or bolsters stuffed with down from ostrich ta'en, and between them a somewhat, as it were a hummock great of span or a hare with ears back lain while terrace-roof and pilasters completed the plan; and indeed she surpassed the bough of the myrobalan with her beauty and symmetry, and the Indian rattan, for she was even as saith of them the poet whom love did unman,
""Her lip-dews rival honey-sweets, that sweet virginity; *
       &nbsp     Keener than Hindi scymitar the glance she casts at thee:
She shames the bending bough of Bán with graceful movement slow *
       &nbsp     And as she smiles her teeth appear with leven's brilliancy:
When I compared with rose a-bloom the tintage of her cheeks, *
       &nbsp    She laughed in scorn and cried, 'Whoso compares with rosery
My hue and breasts, granados terms, is there no shame in him? *
       &nbsp    How should pomegranates bear on bough such fruit in form or
       &nbsp    blee?
Now by my beauty and mine eyes and heart and eke by Heaven *
       &nbsp    Of favours mine and by the Hell of my unclemency,
They say 'She is a garden-rose in very pride of bloom'; *
       &nbsp   And yet no rose can ape my cheek nor branch my symmetry!
If any garden own a thing which unto me is like, *
       &nbsp   What then is that he comes to crave of me and only me?""'
They ceased not to laugh and play, whilst Hasan stood still a-watching them, forgetting meat and drink, till near the hour of mid-afternoon prayer, when the beauty, the chief damsel, said to her mates, ""O Kings' daughters, it waxeth late and our land is afar and we are weary of this stead. Come, therefore, let us depart to our own place."" So they all arose and donned their feather vests, and becoming birds as they were before, flew away all together, with the chief lady in their midst. Then, Hasan, despairing of their return, would have arisen and gone down into the palace but could not move or even stand; wherefore the tears ran down his cheeks and passion was sore on him and he recited these couplets,
""May God deny me boon of troth if I * After your absence sweets
       &nbsp    of slumber know:
Yea; since that sev'rance never close mine eyes, * Nor rest
       &nbsp     repose me since departed you!
'Twould seem as though you saw me in your sleep; * Would Heaven
       &nbsp     the dreams of sleep were real-true!
Indeed I dote on sleep though needed not, * For sleep may bring
       &nbsp    me that dear form to view.""
Then Hasan walked on, little by little, heeding not the way he went, till he reached the foot of the stairs, whence he dragged himself to his own chamber; then he entered and shutting the door, lay sick eating not nor drinking and drowned in the sea of his solitude. He spent the night thus, weeping and bemoaning himself, till the morning, and when it morrowed he repeated these couplets,
""The birds took flight at eve and winged their way; * And sinless
       &nbsp    he who died of Love's death-blow.
I'll keep my love-tale secret while I can * But, an desire
       &nbsp    prevail, its needs must show:
Night brought me nightly vision, bright as dawn; * While nights
       &nbsp    of my desire lack morning-glow.
I mourn for them while they heart-freest sleep * And winds
       &nbsp     of love on me their plaything blow:
Free I bestow my tears, my wealth, my heart * My wit, my sprite:
       &nbsp     most gain who most bestow!
The worst of woes and banes is enmity * Beautiful maidens deal us
       &nbsp     to our woe.
Favour they say's forbidden to the fair * And shedding lovers'
       &nbsp     blood their laws allow;
That naught can love-sicks do but lavish soul, * And stake in
       &nbsp    love-play life on single throw:
I cry in longing ardour for my love: * Lover can only weep and
       &nbsp    wail Love-lowe.""
When the sun rose he opened the door, went forth of the chamber and mounted to the stead where he was before: then he sat down facing the pavilion and awaited the return of the birds till nightfall; but they returned not; wherefore he wept till he fell to the ground in a fainting-fit. When he came to after his swoon, he dragged himself down the stairs to his chamber; and indeed, the darkness was come and straitened upon him was the whole world and he ceased not to weep and wail himself through the livelong night, till the day broke and the sun rained over hill and dale its rays serene. He ate not nor drank nor slept, nor was there any rest for him; but by day he was distracted and by night distressed, with sleeplessness delirious and drunken with melancholy thought and excess of love-longing. And he repeated the verses of the love-distraught poet,
""O thou who shamest sun in morning sheen * The branch
       &nbsp     confounding, yet with nescience blest;
Would Heaven I wot an Time shall bring return * And quench the
       &nbsp     fires which flame unmanifest,—
Bring us together in a close embrace, * Thy cheek upon my cheek,
       &nbsp     thy breast abreast!
Who saith, In Love dwells sweetness? when in Love * Are bitterer
       &nbsp    days than Aloës bitterest.""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-eighty Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan the goldsmith felt love redouble upon him, he recited those lines; and, as he abode thus in the stress of his love-distraction, alone and finding none to cheer him with company, behold, there arose a dust-cloud from the desert, wherefore he ran down and hid himself knowing that the Princesses who owned the castle had returned. Before long, the troops halted and dismounted round the palace and the seven damsels alighted and entering, put off their arms and armour of war. As for the youngest, she stayed not to doff her weapons and gear, but went straight to Hasan's chamber, where finding him not, she sought for him, till she lighted on him in one of the sleeping closets hidden, feeble and thin, with shrunken body and wasted bones and indeed his colour was changed and his eyes sunken in his face for lack of food and drink and for much weeping, by reason of his love and longing for the young lady. When she saw him in this plight, she was confounded and lost her wits; but presently she questioned him of his case and what had befallen him, saying, ""Tell me what aileth thee, O my brother, that I may contrive to do away thine affliction, and I will be thy ransom!"" Whereupon he wept with sore weeping and by way of reply he began reciting,
""Lover, when parted from the thing he loves, * Has naught save
       &nbsp  weary woe and bane to bear.
Inside is sickness, outside living lowe, * His first is fancy and
       &nbsp    his last despair.""
When his sister heard this, she marvelled at his eloquence and loquent speech and his readiness at answering her in verse and said to him, ""O my brother, when didst thou fall into this thy case and what hath betided thee, that I find thee speaking in song and shedding tears that throng? Allah upon thee, O my brother, and by the honest love which is between us, tell me what aileth thee and discover to me thy secret, nor conceal from me aught of that which hath befallen thee in our absence; for my breast is straitened and my life is troubled because of thee."" He sighed and railed tears like rain, after which he said, ""I fear, O my sister, if I tell thee, that thou wilt not aid me to win my wish but wilt leave me to die wretchedly in mine anguish."" She replied, ""No, by Allah, O my brother, I will not abandon thee, though it cost me my life!"" So he told her all that had befallen him, and that the cause of his distress and affliction was the passion he had conceived for the young lady whom he had seen when he opened the forbidden door; and how he had not tasted meat nor drink for ten days past. Then he wept with sore weeping and recited these couplets,
""Restore my heart as 'twas within my breast, * Let mine eyes
       &nbsp     sleep again, then fly fro' me.
Deem ye the nights have had the might to change * Love's vow?
       &nbsp     Who changeth may he never be!""
His sister wept for his weeping and was moved to ruth for his case and pitied his strangerhood; so she said to him, ""O my brother, be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear, for I will venture being and risk existence to content thee and devise thee a device wherewith, though it cost me my dear life and all I hold dear, thou mayst get possession of her and accomplish thy desire, if such be the will of Allah Almighty. But I charge thee, O my brother, keep the matter secret from my sisterhood and discover not thy case to any one of them, lest my life be lost with thy life. An they question thee of opening the forbidden door, reply to them, 'I opened it not; no, never; but I was troubled at heart for your absence and by my loneliness here and yearning for you.'"" And he answered, ""Yes: this is the right rede."" So he kissed her head and his heart was comforted and his bosom broadened. He had been nigh upon death for excess of affright, for he had gone in fear of her by reason of his having opened the door; but now his life and soul returned to him. Then he sought of her somewhat of food and after serving it she left him, and went in to her sisters, weeping and mourning for him. They questioned her of her case and she told them how she was heavy at heart for her brother, because he was sick and for ten days no food had found way into his stomach. So they asked the cause of his sickness and she answered, ""The reason was our severance from him and our leaving him desolate; for these days we have been absent from him were longer to him than a thousand years and scant blame to him, seeing he is a stranger, and solitary and we left him alone, with none to company with him or hearten his heart; more by token that he is but a youth and may be he called to mind his family and his mother, who is a woman in years, and bethought him that she weepeth for him all whiles of the day and watches of the night, ever mourning his loss; and we used to solace him with our society and divert him from thinking of her."" When her sisters heard these words they wept in the stress of their distress for him and said, ""Wa'lláhi—'fore Allah, he is not to blame!"" Then they went out to the army and dismissed it, after which they went into Hasan and saluted him with the salam. When they saw his charms changed with yellow colour and shrunken body, they wept for very pity and sat by his side and comforted him and cheered him with converse, relating to him all they had seen by the way of wonders and rarities and what had befallen the bridegroom with the bride. They abode with him thus a whole month, tendering him and caressing him with words sweeter than syrup; but every day sickness was added to his sickness, which when they saw, they bewept him with sore weeping, and the youngest wept even more than the rest. At the end of this time, the Princesses having made up their minds to ride forth a-hunting and a-birding invited their sister to accompany them, but she said, ""By Allah, O my sisters, I cannot go forth with you whilst my brother is in this plight, nor indeed till he be restored to health and there cease from him that which is with him of affliction. Rather will I sit with him and comfort him."" They thanked her for her kindness and said to her, ""Allah will requite thee all thou dost with this stranger."" Then they left her with him in the palace and rode forth taking with them twenty days' victual;—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Eighty-ninth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Princesses mounted and rode forth a-hunting and a-birding, after leaving in the palace their youngest sister sitting by Hasan's side; and as soon as the damsel knew that they had covered a long distance from home, she went in to him and said, ""O my brother, come, show me the place where thou sawest the maidens."" He rejoiced in her words, making sure of winning his wish, and replied, ""Bismillah! On my head!"" Then he essayed to rise and show her the place, but could not walk; so she took him up in her arms, holding him to her bosom between her breasts; and, opening the staircase-door, carried him to the top of the palace, and he showed her the pavilion where he had seen the girls and the basin of water, wherein they had bathed. Then she said to him, ""Set forth to me, O my brother, their case and how they came."" So he described to her whatso he had seen of them and especially the girl of whom he was enamoured; but hearing these words she knew her and her cheeks paled and her case changed. Quoth he, ""O my sister, what aileth thee to wax wan and be troubled?""; and quoth she, ""O my brother, know thou that this young lady is the daughter of a Sovran of the Jann, of one of the most puissant of their Kings, and her father had dominion over men and Jinn and wizards and Cohens and tribal chiefs and guards and countries and cities and islands galore and hath immense wealth in store. Our father is a Viceroy and one of his vassals and none can avail against him, for the multitude of his many and the extent of his empire and the muchness of his monies. He hath assigned to his offspring, the daughters thou sawest, a tract of country, a whole year's journey in length and breadth, a region girt about with a great river and a deep; and thereto none may attain, nor man nor Jann. He hath an army of women, smiters with swords and lungers with lances, five-and-twenty thousand in number, each of whom, whenas she mounteth steed and donneth battle-gear, eveneth a thousand knights of the bravest. Moreover, he hath seven daughters, who in valour and prowess equal and even excel their sisters, and he hath made the eldest of them, the damsel whom thou sawest, queen over the country aforesaid and who is the wisest of her sisters and in valour and horsemanship and craft and skill and magic excels all the folk of her dominions. The girls who companied with her are the ladies of her court and guards and grandees of her empire, and the plumed skins wherewith they fly are the handiwork of enchanters of the Jann. Now an thou wouldst get possession of this queen and wed this jewel seld-seen and enjoy her beauty and loveliness and grace, do thou pay heed to my words and keep them in thy memory. They resort to this place on the first day of every month; and thou must take seat here and watch for them; and when thou seest them coming hide thee near the pavilion sitting where thou mayst see them, without being seen of them, and beware, again beware lest thou show thyself, or we shall all lose our lives. When they doff their dress note which is the feather-suit of her whom thou lovest and take it, and it only, for this it is that carrieth her to her country, and when thou hast mastered it, thou hast mastered her. And beware lest she wile thee, saying, 'O thou who hast robbed my raiment, restore it to me, because here am I in thine hands and at thy mercy!' For, an thou give it her, she will kill thee and break down over us palace and pavilion and slay our sire: know, then, thy case and how thou shalt act. When her companions see that her feather-suit is stolen, they will take flight and leave her to thee, and beware lest thou show thyself to them, but wait till they have flown away and she despaireth of them: whereupon do thou go in to her and hale her by the hair of her head and drag her to thee; which being done, she will be at thy mercy. And I rede thee discover not to her that thou hast taken the feather-suit, but keep it with care; for, so long as thou hast it in hold, she is thy prisoner and in thy power, seeing that she cannot fly to her country save with it. And lastly carry her down to thy chamber where she will be thine."" When Hasan heard her words his heart became at ease, his trouble ceased and affliction left him; so he rose to his feet and kissing his sister's head, went down from the terrace with her into the palace, where they slept that night. He medicined himself till morning morrowed; and when the sun rose, he sprang up and opened the staircase-door and ascending to the flat roof sat there till supper-tide when his sister brought him up somewhat of meat and drink and a change of clothes and he slept. And thus they continued doing, day by day until the end of the month. When he saw the new moon, he rejoiced and began to watch for the birds, and while he was thus, behold, up they came, like lightning. As soon as he espied them, he hid himself where he could watch them, unwatched by them, and they lighted down one and all of them, and putting off their clothes, descended into the basin. All this took place near the stead where Hasan lay concealed, and as soon as he caught sight of the girl he loved, he arose and crept under cover, little by little, towards the dresses, and Allah veiled him so that none marked his approach for they were laughing and playing with one another, till he laid hand on the dress. Now when they had made an end of their diversion, they came forth of the basin and each of them slipped on her feather-suit. But the damsel he loved sought for her plumage that she might put it on, but found it not; whereupon she shrieked and beat her cheeks and rent her raiment. Her sisterhood came to her and asked what ailed her, and she told them that her feather-suit was missing; wherefore they wept and shrieked and buffeted their faces: and they were confounded, wotting not the cause of this, and knew not what to do. Presently the night overtook them and they feared to abide with her lest that which had befallen her should befal them also; so they farewelled her and flying away left her alone upon the terrace-roof of the palace, by the pavilion basin.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninetieth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan had carried off the girl's plumery, she sought it but found it not and her sisterhood flew away leaving her alone. When they were out of sight, Hasan gave ear to her and heard her say, ""O who hast taken my dress and stripped me, I beseech thee to restore it to me and cover my shame, so may Allah never make thee taste of my tribulation!"" But when Hasan heard her speak thus, with speech sweeter than syrup, his love for her redoubled, passion got the mastery of his reason and he had not patience to endure from her. So springing up from his hiding-place, he rushed upon her and laying hold of her by the hair dragged her to him and carried her down to the basement of the palace and set her in his own chamber, where he threw over her a silken cloak and left her weeping and biting her hands. Then he shut the door upon her and going to his sister, informed her how he had made prize of his lover and carried her to his sleeping-closet, ""And there,"" quoth he, ""she is now sitting, weeping and biting her hands."" When his sister heard this, she rose forthright and betook herself to the chamber, where she found the captive weeping and mourning. So she kissed ground before her and saluted her with the salam and the young lady said to her, ""O King's daughter, do folk like you do such foul deed with the daughters of Kings? Thou knowest that my father is a mighty Sovran and that all the liege lords of the Jinn stand in awe of him and fear his majesty: for that there are with him magicians and sages and Cohens and Satans and Marids, such as none may cope withal, and under his hand are folk whose number none knoweth save Allah. How then doth it become you, O daughters of Kings, to harbour mortal men with you and disclose to them our case and yours? Else how should this man, a stranger, come at us?"" Hasan's sister made reply, ""O King's daughter, in very sooth this human is perfect in nobleness and purposeth thee no villainy; but he loveth thee, and women were not made save for men. Did he not love thee, he had not fallen sick for thy sake and well-nigh given up the ghost for desire of thee."" And she told her the whole tale how Hasan had seen her bathing in the basin with her attendants, and fallen in love with her, and none had pleased him but she, for the rest were all her handmaids, and none had availed to put forth a hand to her. When the Princess heard this, she despaired of deliverance and presently Hasan's sister went forth and brought her a costly dress, wherein she robed her. Then she set before her somewhat of meat and drink and ate with her and heartened her heart and soothed her sorrows. And she ceased not to speak her fair with soft and pleasant words, saying, ""Have pity on him who saw thee once and became as one slain by thy love;"" and continued to console her and caress her, quoting fair says and pleasant instances. But she wept till daybreak, when her trouble subsided and she left shedding tears, knowing that she had fallen into the net and that there was no deliverance for her. Then said she to Hasan's sister, ""O King's daughter, with this my strangerhood and severance from my country and sisterhood which Allah wrote upon my brow, patience becometh me to support what my Lord hath foreordained."" Therewith the youngest Princess assigned her a chamber in the palace, than which there was none goodlier and ceased not to sit with her and console her and solace her heart, till she was satisfied with her lot and her bosom was broadened and she laughed and there ceased from her what trouble and oppression possessed her, by reason of her separation from her people and country and sisterhood and parents. Thereupon Hasan's sister repaired to him, and said, ""Arise, go in to her in her chamber and kiss her hands and feet."" So he went in to her and did this and bussed her between the eyes, saying, ""O Princess of fair ones and life of sprites and beholder's delight, be easy of heart, for I took thee only that I might be thy bondsman till the Day of Doom, and this my sister will be thy servant; for I, O my lady, desire naught but to take thee to wife, after the law of Allah and the practice of His Apostle, and whenas thou wilt, I will journey with thee to my country and carry thee to Baghdad-city and abide with thee there: moreover, I will buy thee handmaidens and negro chattels; and I have a mother, of the best of women, who will do thee service. There is no goodlier land than our land; everything therein is better than elsewhere and its folk are a pleasant people and bright of face."" Now as he bespake her thus and strave to comfort her, what while she answered him not a syllable, lo! there came a knocking at the palace-gate. So Hasan went out to see who was at the door and found there the six Princesses, who had returned from hunting and birding, whereat he rejoiced and went to meet them and welcomed them. They wished him safety and health and he wished them the like; after which they dismounted and going each to her chamber doffed their soiled clothes and donned fine linen. Then they came forth and demanded the game, for they had taken a store of gazelles and wild cows, hares and lions, hyaenas, and others; so their suite brought out some thereof for butchering, keeping the rest by them in the palace, and Hasan girt himself and fell to slaughtering for them in due form, whilst they sported and made merry, joying with great joy to see him standing amongst them hale and hearty once more. When they had made an end of slaughtering, they sat down and addressed themselves to get ready somewhat for breaking their fast, and Hasan, coming up to the eldest Princess, kissed her head and on like wise did he with the rest, one after other. Whereupon said they to him, ""Indeed, thou humblest thyself to us passing measure, O our brother, and we marvel at the excess of the affection thou showest us. But Allah forfend that thou shouldst do this thing, which it behoveth us rather to do with thee, seeing thou art a man and therefor worthier than we, who are of the Jinn."" Thereupon his eyes brimmed with tears and he wept sore; so they said to him, ""What causeth thee to weep? Indeed, thou troublest our pleasant lives with thy weeping this day. 'Twould seem thou longest after thy mother and native land. An things be so, we will equip thee and carry thee to thy home and thy friends."" He replied, ""By Allah, I desire not to part from you!"" Then they asked, ""Which of us hath vexed thee, that thou art thus troubled?"" But he was ashamed to say, ""Naught troubleth me save love of a damsel,"" lest they should deny and disavow him: so he was silent and would tell them nothing of his case. Then his sister came forward and said to them, ""He hath caught a bird from the air and would have you help him to tame her."" Whereupon they all turned to him and cried, ""We are at thy service every one of us and whatsoever thou seekest that will we do: but tell us thy tale and conceal from us naught of thy case."" So he said to his sister, ""Do thou tell them, for I am ashamed before them nor can I face them with these words.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-first Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan said to his sister, ""Do thou tell them my tale, for before them I stand abashed nor can I face them with these words."" So she said to them, ""O my sisters, when we went away and left alone this unhappy one, the palace was straitened upon him and he feared lest some one should come in to him, for ye know that the sons of Adam are light of wits. So, he opened the door of the staircase leading to the roof, of his loneliness and trouble, and sat there, looking upon the Wady and watching the gate, in his fear lest any should come thither. One day, as he sat thus, suddenly he saw ten birds approach him, making for the palace, and they lighted down on the brink of the basin which is in the pavilion-terrace. He watched these birds and saw, amongst them, one goodlier than the rest, which pecked the others and flouted them, whilst none of them dared put out a claw to it. Presently, they set their nails to their neck-collars and, rending their feather-suits, came forth therefrom and became damsels, each and every, like the moon on fullest night. Then they doffed their dress and plunging into the water, fell to playing with one another, whilst the chief damsel ducked the others, who dared not lay a finger on her and she was fairest of favour and most famous of form and most feateous of finery. They ceased not to be in this case till near the hour of mid-afternoon prayer, when they came forth of the basin and, donning their feather-shifts, flew away home. Thereupon he waxed distracted, with a heart afire for love of the chief damsel and repenting him that he had not stolen her plumery. Wherefore he fell sick and abode on the palace-roof expecting her return and abstaining from meat and drink and sleep, and he ceased not to be so till the new moon showed, when behold, they again made their appearance according to custom and doffing their dresses went down into the basin. So he stole the chief damsel's feather-suit, knowing that she could not fly save therewith, hiding himself carefully lest they sight him and slay him. Then he waited till the rest had flown away, when he arose and seizing the damsel, carried her down from the terrace into the castle."" Her sisters asked, ""Where is she?""; and she answered, ""She is with him in such a chamber."" Quoth they, ""Describe her to us, O our sister:"" so quoth she, ""She is fairer than the moon on the night of fullness and her face is sheenier than the sun; the dew of her lips is sweeter than honey and her shape is straighter and slenderer than the cane; one with eyes black as night and brow flower-white; a bosom jewel-bright, breasts like pomegranates twain and cheeks like apples twain, a waist with dimples overlain, a navel like a casket of ivory full of musk in grain, and legs like columns of alabastrine vein. She ravisheth all hearts with Nature-kohl'd eyne, and a waist slender-fine and hips of heaviest design and speech that heals all pain and pine: she is goodly of shape and sweet of smile, as she were the moon in fullest sheen and shine."" When the Princesses heard these praises, they turned to Hasan and said to him, ""Show her to us."" So he arose with them, all love-distraught, and carrying them to the chamber wherein was the captive damsel, opened the door and entered, preceding the seven Princesses. Now when they saw her and noted her loveliness, they kissed the ground between her hands, marvelling at the fairness of her favour and the significance which showed her inner gifts, and said to her, ""By Allah, O daughter of the Sovran Supreme, this is indeed a mighty matter: and haddest thou heard tell of this mortal among women thou haddest marvelled at him all thy days. Indeed, he loveth thee with passionate love; yet, O King's daughter, he seeketh not lewdness, but desireth thee only in the way of lawful wedlock. Had we known that maids can do without men, we had impeached him from his intent, albeit he sent thee no messenger, but came to thee in person; and he telleth us he hath burnt the feather dress; else had we taken it from him."" Then one of them agreed with the Princess and becoming her deputy in the matter of the wedding contract, performed the marriage ceremony between them, whilst Hasan clapped palms with her, laying his hand in hers, and she wedded him to the damsel by consent; after which they celebrated her bridal feast, as beseemeth Kings' daughters, and brought Hasan in to her. So he rose and rent the veil and oped the gate and pierced the forge and brake the seal, whereupon affection for her waxed in him and he redoubled in love and longing for her. Then, since he had gotten that which he sought, he gave himself joy and improvised these couplets,
""Thy shape's temptation, eyes as Houri's fain * And sheddeth
       &nbsp     Beauty's sheen that radiance rare:
My glance portrayed thy glorious portraiture: * Rubies one-half
       &nbsp     and gems the third part were:
Musk made a fifth: a sixth was ambergris * The sixth a pearl but
       &nbsp     pearl without compare.
Eve never bare a daughter evening thee * Nor breathes thy like in
       &nbsp    Khuld's celestial air.
An thou would torture me 'tis wont of Love * And if thou pardon
       &nbsp     'tis thy choice I swear:
Then, O world bright'ner and O end of wish! * Loss of thy charms
       &nbsp     who could in patience bear?""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-second Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan went in unto the King's daughter and did away her maidenhead, he enjoyed her with exceeding joy and affection for her waxed in him and he redoubled in love-longing for her; so he recited the lines aforesaid. Now the Princesses were standing at the door and when they heard his verses, they said to her, ""O King's daughter, hearest thou the words of this mortal? How canst thou blame us, seeing that he maketh poetry for love of thee and indeed he hath so done a thousand times."" When she heard this she rejoiced and was glad and felt happy and Hasan abode with her forty days in all solace and delight, joyance and happiest plight, whilst the damsels renewed festivities for him every day and overwhelmed him with bounty and presents and rarities; and the King's daughter became reconciled to her sojourn amongst them and forgot her kith and kin. At the end of the forty days, Hasan saw in a dream, one night, his mother mourning for him and indeed her bones were wasted and her body had waxed shrunken and her complexion had yellowed and her favour had changed the while he was in excellent case. When she saw him in this state, she said to him, ""O my son, O Hasan, how is it that thou livest thy worldly life at thine ease and forgettest me? Look at my plight since thy loss! I do not forget thee, nor will my tongue cease to name thy name till I die; and I have made thee a tomb in my house, that I may never forget thee. Would Heaven I knew if I shall live, O my son, to see thee by my side and if we shall ever again foregather as we were."" Thereupon Hasan awoke from sleep, weeping and wailing, the tears railed down his cheeks like rain and he became mournful and melancholy; his tears dried not nor did sleep visit him, but he had no rest, and no patience was left to him. When he arose, the Princesses came in to him and gave him good-morrow and made merry with him as was their wont; but he paid no heed to them; so they asked his wife concerning his case and she said, ""I ken not."" Quoth they, ""Question him of his condition."" So she went up to him and said, ""What aileth thee, O my lord?"" Whereupon he moaned and groaned and told her what he had seen in his dream and repeated these two couplets,
""Indeed afflicted sore are we and all distraught, * Seeking for
       &nbsp    union; yet we find no way:
And Love's calamities upon us grow * And Love though light with
       &nbsp    heaviest weight doth weigh.""
His wife repeated to the Princesses what he said and they, hearing the verses, had pity on him and said to him, ""In Allah's name, do as thou wilt, for we may not hinder thee from visiting thy mother; nay, we will help thee to thy wish by what means we may. But it behoveth that thou desert us not, but visit us, though it be only once a year."" And he answered, ""To hear is to obey: be your behest on my head and eyes!"" Then they arose forthright and making him ready victual for the voyage, equipped the bride for him with raiment and ornaments and everything of price, such as defy description, and they bestowed on him gifts and presents which pens of ready writers lack power to set forth. Then they beat the magical kettle-drum and up came the dromedaries from all sides. They chose of them such as could carry all the gear they had prepared; amongst the rest five-and-twenty chests of gold and fifty of silver; and, mounting Hasan and his bride on others, rode with them three days, wherein they accomplished a march of three months. Then they bade them farewell and addressed themselves to return; whereupon his sister, the youngest damsel, threw herself on Hasan's neck and wept till she fainted. When she came to herself, she repeated these two couplets,
""Ne'er dawn the severance-day on any wise * That robs of sleep
       &nbsp     these heavy-lidded eyes.
From us and thee it hath fair union torn * It wastes our force
       &nbsp    and makes our forms its prize.""
Her verses finished she farewelled him, straitly charging him, whenas he should have come to his native land and have foregathered with his mother and set his heart at ease, to fail not of visiting her once in every six months and saying, ""If aught grieve thee or thou fear aught of vexation, beat the Magian's kettle-drum, whereupon the dromedaries shall come to thee; and do thou mount and return to us and persist not in staying away."" He swore thus to do and conjured them to go home. So they returned to the palace, mourning for their separation from him, especially the youngest, with whom no rest would stay nor would Patience her call obey, but she wept night and day. Thus it was with them; but as regards Hasan and his wife, they fared on by day and night over plain and desert site and valley and stony heights through noon-tide glare and dawn's soft light; and Allah decreed them safety, so that they reached Bassorah-city without hindrance and made their camels kneel at the door of his house. Hasan then dismissed the dromedaries and, going up to the door to open it, heard his mother weeping and in a faint strain, from a heart worn with parting-pain and on fire with consuming bane, reciting these couplets,
""How shall he taste of sleep who lacks repose * Who wakes a-night
       &nbsp   when all in slumber wone?
He owned wealth and family and fame * Yet fared from house and
       &nbsp  home an exile lone:
Live coal beneath his ribs he bears for bane, * And mighty
       &nbsp  longing, mightier ne'er was known:
Passion hath seized him, Passion mastered him; * Yet is he
       &nbsp   constant while he maketh moan:
His case for Love proclaimeth aye that he, * (As prove his tears)
       &nbsp   is wretched, woebegone.""
When Hasan heard his mother weeping and wailing he wept also and knocked at the door a loud knock. Quoth she, ""Who is at the door?""; and quoth he, ""Open!"" Whereupon she opened the door and knowing him at first sight fell down in a fainting fit; but he ceased not to tend her till she came to herself, when he embraced her and she embraced him and kissed him, whilst his wife looked on mother and son. Then he carried his goods and gear into the house, whilst his mother, for that her heart was comforted and Allah had reunited her with her son versified with these couplets,
""Fortune had ruth upon my plight * Pitied my long long bane and
       &nbsp    blight;
Gave me what I would liefest sight; * And set me free from all
       &nbsp    afright.
So pardon I the sin that sin * nèd she in days evanisht quite;
E'en to the sin she sinned when she * Bleached my hair-parting
       &nbsp     silvern white.""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-third Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan with his mother then sat talking and she asked him, ""How faredst thou, O my son, with the Persian?"" whereto he answered, ""O my mother, he was no Persian, but a Magian, who worshipped the fire, not the All-powerful Sire."" Then he told her how he dealt with him, in that he had journeyed with him to the Mountain of Clouds and sewed him up in the camel's skin, and how the vultures had taken him up and set him down on the summit and what he had seen there of dead folk, whom the Magian had deluded and left to die on the crest after they had done his desire. And he told her how he had cast himself from the mountain-top into the sea and Allah the Most High had preserved him and brought him to the palace of the seven Princesses and how the youngest of them had taken him to brother and he had sojourned with them till the Almighty brought the Magian to the place where he was and he slew him. Moreover, he told her of his passion for the King's daughter and how he had made prize of her and of his seeing her in sleep and all else that had befallen him up to the time when Allah vouchsafed them reunion. She wondered at his story and praised the Lord who had restored him to her in health and safety. Then she arose and examined the baggage and loads and questioned him of them. So he told her what was in them, whereat she joyed with exceeding joy. Then she went up to the King's daughter, to talk with her and bear her company; but, when her eyes fell on her, her wits were confounded at her brilliancy and she rejoiced and marvelled at her beauty and loveliness and symmetry and perfect grace: and she sat down beside her, cheering her and comforting her heart while she never ceased to repeat ""Alhamdolillah, O my son, for thy return to me safe and sound!"" Next morning early she went down into the market and bought mighty fine furniture and ten suits of the richest raiment in the city, and clad the young wife and adorned her with everything seemiy. Then said she to Hasan, ""O my son, we cannot tarry in this town with all this wealth; for thou knowest that we are poor folk and the people will suspect us of practising alchemy. So come, let us depart to Baghdad, the House of Peace, where we may dwell in the Caliph's Sanctuary, and thou shalt sit in a shop to buy and sell, in the fear of Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty!) and He shall open to thee the door of blessings with this wealth."" Hasan approved her counsel and going forth straightway, sold the house and summoned the dromedaries, which he loaded with all his goods and gear, together with his mother and wife. Then he went down to the Tigris, where he hired him a craft to carry them to Baghdad and embarked therein all his possessions and his mother and wife. They sailed up the river with a fair wind for ten days till they drew in sight of Baghdad, at which they all rejoiced, and the ship landed them in the city, where without stay or delay Hasan hired a storehouse in one of the caravanserais and transported his goods thither. He lodged that night in the Khan, and on the morrow he changed his clothes and going down into the city, enquired for a broker. The folk directed him to one, and when the broker saw him, he asked him what he lacked. Quoth he, ""I want a house, a handsome one and a spacious."" So the broker showed him the houses at his disposal and he chose one that belonged to one of the Wazirs and buying it of him for an hundred thousand golden dinars, gave him the price. Then he returned to his caravanserai and removed all his goods and monies to the house; after which he went down to the market and bought all the mansion needed of vessels and carpets and other household stuff, besides servants and eunuchs, including a little black boy for the house. He abode with his wife in all solace and delight of life three years, during which time he was vouchsafed by her two sons, one of whom he named Násir and the other Mansúr: but, at the end of this time he bethought him of his sisters, the Princesses, and called to mind all their goodness to him and how they had helped him to his desire. So he longed after them and going out to the marketstreets of the city, bought trinkets and costly stuffs and fruit-confections, such as they had never seen or known. His mother asked him the reason of his buying these rarities and he answered, ""I purpose to visit my sisters, who showed me every kind of kindness and all the wealth that I at present enjoy is due to their goodness and munificence: wherefore I will journey to them and return soon, Inshallah!"" Quoth she, ""O my son, be not long absent from me;"" and quoth he, ""Know, O my mother, how thou shalt do with my wife. Here is her feather-dress in a chest, buried under ground in such a place; do thou watch over it, lest haply she hap on it and take it, for she would fly away, she and her children, and I should never hear of them again and should die of grieving for them; wherefore take heed, O my mother, while I warn thee that thou name this not to her. Thou must know that she is the daughter of a King of the Jinn, than whom there is not a greater among the Sovrans of the Jann nor a richer in troops and treasure, and she is mistress of her people and dearest to her father of all he hath. Moreover, she is passing high-spirited, so do thou serve her thyself and suffer her not to go forth the door neither look out of window nor over the wall, for I fear the air for her when it bloweth, and if aught befel her of the calamities of this world, I should slay myself for her sake."" She replied, ""O my son, I take refuge with Allah from gainsaying thee! Am I mad that thou shouldst lay this charge on me and I disobey thee therein? Depart, O my son, with heart at ease, and please Allah, soon thou shalt return in safety and see her and she shall tell thee how I have dealt with her: but tarry not, O my son, beyond the time of travel.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-fourth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan had determined to visit the Princesses, he gave his mother the orders we have mentioned. Now, as Fate would have it, his wife heard what he said to his mother and neither of them knew it. Then Hasan went without the city and beat the kettle-drum, whereupon up came the dromedaries and he loaded twenty of them with rarities of Al-Irak; after which he returned to his mother and repeated his charge to her and took leave of her and his wife and children, one of whom was a yearling babe and the other two years old. Then he mounted and fared on, without stopping night or day, over hills and valleys and plains and wastes for a term of ten days till, on the eleventh, he reached the palace and went in to his sisters, with the gifts he had brought them. The Princesses rejoiced at his sight and gave him joy of his safety, whilst his sister decorated the palace within and without. Then they took the presents and, lodging him in a chamber as before, asked him of his mother and his wife, and he told them that she had borne him two sons. And the youngest Princess, seeing him well and in good case, joyed with exceeding joy and repeated this couplet,
""I ever ask for news of you from whatso breezes pass * And never any but yourselves can pass across my mind.""
Then he abode with them in all honour and hospitality, for three months, spending his time in feasting and merrymaking, joy and delight, hunting and sporting. So fared it with him; but as regards his wife, she abode with his mother two days after her husband's departure, and on the third day, she said to her, ""Glory be to God! Have I lived with him three years and shall I never go to the bath?"" Then she wept and Hasan's mother had pity on her condition and said to her, ""O my daughter, here we are strangers and thy husband is abroad. Were he at home, he would serve thee himself, but, as for me, I know no one. However, O my daughter, I will heat thee water and wash thy head in the Hammam-bath which is in the house."" Answered the King's daughter, ""O my lady, hadst thou spoken thus to one of the slave-girls, she had demanded to be sold in the Sultan's open market and had not abode with thee. Men are excusable, because they are jealous and their reason telleth them that, if a woman go forth the house, haply she will do frowardness. But women, O my lady, are not all equal and alike and thou knowest that, if woman have a mind to aught, whether it be the Hammam or what not else, none hath power over her to guard her or keep her chaste or debar her from her desire; for she will do whatso she willeth and naught restraineth her but her reason and her religion."" Then she wept and cursed fate and bemoaned herself and her strangerhood, till Hasan's mother was moved to ruth for her case and knew that all she said was but truth and that there was nothing for it but to let her have her way. So she committed the affair to Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) and making ready all that they needed for the bath, took her and went with her to the Hammam. She carried her two little sons with her, and when they entered, they put off their clothes and all the women fell to gazing on the Princess and glorifying God (to whom belong Might and Majesty!) for that He had created so fair a form. The women of the city, even those who were passing by, flocked to gaze upon her, and the report of her was noised abroad in Baghdad till the bath was crowded that there was no passing through it. Now it chanced there was present on that day and on that rare occasion with the rest of the women in the Hammam, one of the slave-girls of the Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, by name Tohfah the Lutanist, and she, finding the Hammam over crowded and no passing for the throng of women and girls, asked what was to do; and they told her of the young lady. So she walked up to her and, considering her closely, was amazed at her grace and loveliness and glorified God (magnified be His majesty!) for the fair forms He hath created. The sight hindered her from her bath, so that she went not farther in nor washed, but sat staring at the Princess, till she had made an end of bathing and coming forth of the caldarium donned her raiment, whereupon beauty was added to her beauty. She sat down on the divan, whilst the women gazed upon her; then she looked at them and veiling herself, went out. Tohfah went out with her and followed her, till she saw where she dwelt, when she left her and returned to the Caliph's palace; and ceased not wending till she went in to the Lady Zubaydah and kissed ground between her hands; whereupon quoth her mistress, ""O Tohfah, why hast thou tarried in the Hammam?"" She replied, ""O my lady, I have seen a marvel, never saw I its like amongst men or women, and this it was that distracted me and dazed my wit and amazed me, so that I forgot even to wash my head."" Asked Zubaydah, ""And what was that?"" ; and Tohfah answered, ""O my lady, I saw a damsel in the bath, having with her two little boys like moons, eye never espied her like, nor before her nor after her, neither is there the fellow of her form in the whole world nor her peer amongst Ajams or Turks or Arabs. By the munificence, O my lady, an thou toldest the Commander of the Faithful of her, he would slay her husband and take her from him, for her like is not to be found among women. I asked of her mate and they told me that he is a merchant Hasan of Bassorah hight. Moreover, I followed her from the bath to her own house and found it to be that of the Wazir, with the two gates, one opening on the river and the other on the land. Indeed, O my lady, I fear lest the Prince of True Believers hear of her and break the law and slay her husband and take love-liesse with her.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-fifth Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Tohfah, after seeing the King's daughter, described her beauty to the Lady Zubaydah ending with, ""Indeed, O my mistress, I fear lest the Prince of True Believers hear of her and break the law and slay her mate and take her to wife,"" Zubaydah cried, ""Woe to thee, O Tohfah, say me, doth this damsel display such passing beauty and loveliness that the Commander of the Faithful should, on her account, barter his soul's good for his worldly lust and break the Holy Law! By Allah, needs must I look on her, and if she be not as thou sayest, I will bid strike off thy head! O strumpet, there are in the Caliph's Serraglio three hundred and three score slave girls, after the number of the days of the year, yet is there none amongst them so excellent as thou describest!"" Tohfah replied, ""No, by Allah, O my lady!: nor is there her like in all Baghdad; no, nor amongst the Arabs or the Daylamites nor hath Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty!) created the like of her!"" Thereupon Zuhaydah called for Masrur, the eunuch, who came and kissed the ground before her, and she said to him, ""O Masrur, go to the Wazir's house, that with the two gates, one giving on the water and the other on the land, and bring me the damsel who dwelleth there, also her two children and the old woman who is with her, and haste thou and tarry not."" Said Masrur, ""I hear and I obey,"" and repairing to Hasan's house, knocked at the door. Quoth the old woman, ""Who is at the door?"" and quoth he, ""Masrur, the eunuch of the Commander of the Faithful."" So she opened the door and he entered and saluted her with the salam; whereupon she returned his salute and asked his need; and he replied, ""The Lady Zubaydah, daughter of Al-Kasim and queen-spouse of the Commander of the Faithful Harun al-Rashid sixth of the sons of Al-Abbas, paternal uncle of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and keep!) summoneth thee to her, thee and thy son's wife and her children; for the women have told her anent her and her beauty."" Rejoined the old woman, ""O my lord Masrur, we are foreigner folk and the girl's husband (my son) who is abroad and far from home hath strictly charged me not to go forth nor let her go forth in his absence, neither show her to any of the creatures of Allah Almighty; and I fear me, if aught befal her and he come back, he will slay himself; wherefore of thy favour I beseech thee, O Masrur, require us not of that whereof we are unable."" Masrur retorted, ""O my lady, if I knew aught to be feared for you in this, I would not require you to go; the Lady Zubaydah desireth but to see her and then she may return. So disobey not or thou wilt repent; and like as I take you, I will bring you both back in safety, Inshallah!"" Hasan's mother could not gainsay him; so she went in and making the damsel ready, brought her and her children forth and they all followed Masrur to the palace of the Caliphate where he carried them in and seated them on the floor before the Lady Zubaydah. They kissed ground before her and called down blessings upon her; and Zubaydah said to the young lady (who was veiled), ""Wilt thou not uncover thy face, that I may look on it?"" So she kissed the ground between her hands and discovered a face which put to shame the full moon in the height of heaven. Zubaydah fixed her eyes on her and let their glances wander over her, whilst the palace was illumined by the light of her countenance; whereupon the Queen and the whole company were amazed at her beauty and all who looked on her became Jinn-mad and unable to bespeak one another. As for Zubaydah, she rose and making the damsel stand up, strained her to her bosom and seated her by herself on the couch. Moreover, she bade decorate the palace in her honour and calling for a suit of the richest raiment and a necklace of the rarest ornaments put them upon her. Then said she to her, ""O liege lady of fair ones, verily thou astoundest me and fillest mine eyes. What arts knowest thou?"" She replied, ""O my lady, I have a dress of feathers, and could I but put it on before thee, thou wouldst see one of the fairest of fashions and marvel thereat, and all who saw it would talk of its goodliness, generation after generation."" Zubaydah asked, ""And where is this dress of thine?""; and the damsel answered, ""'Tis with my husband's mother. Do thou seek it for me of her."" So Zubaydah said to the old woman, ""O my lady the pilgrimess, O my mother, go forth and fetch us her feather-dress, that we may solace ourselves by looking on what she will do, and after take it back again."" Replied the old woman, ""O my lady, this damsel is a liar. Hast thou ever seen any of womankind with a dress of feathers? Indeed, this belongeth only to birds."" But the damsel said to the Lady Zubaydah, ""As thou livest, O my lady, she hath a feather-dress of mine and it is in a chest, which is buried in such a store-closet in the house."" So Zubaydah took off her neck a rivière of jewels, worth all the treasures of Chosroe and Cæsar, and gave it to the old woman, saying, ""O my mother, I conjure thee by my life, take this necklace and go and fetch us this dress, that we may divert ourselves with the sight thereof, and after take it again!"" But she sware to her that she had never seen any such dress and wist not what the damsel meant by her speech. Then the Lady Zubaydah cried out at her and taking the key from her, called Masrur and said to him as soon as her came, ""Take this key and go to the house; then open it and enter a store-closet there whose door is such and such and amiddlemost of it thou wilt find a chest buried. Take it out and break it open and bring me the feather-dress which is therein and set it before me.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-sixth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Lady Zubaydah, having taken the key from Hasan's mother, handed it to Masrur, saying, ""Take this key and open such a closet; then bring forth of it the chest; break it open; bring me the feather-dress which is therein and set it before me."" ""Hearkening and obedience,"" replied he and taking the key went forth, whereupon the old woman arose and followed him, weeping-eyed and repenting her of having given ear to the damsel and gone with her to the bath, for her desire to go thither was but a device. So she went with him to the house and opened the door of the closet, and he entered and brought out the chest. Then he took therefrom the feather,dress and wrapping it in a napkin, carried it to the Lady Zubaydah, who took it and turned it about, marvelling at the beauty of its make; after which she gave it to the damsel, saying, ""Is this thy dress of feathers?"" She replied, ""Yes, O my lady,"" and at once putting forth her hand, took it joyfully. Then she examined it and rejoiced to find it whole as it was, not a feather gone. So she rose and came down from beside the Lady Zubaydah and taking her sons in her bosom, wrapped herself in the feather-dress and became a bird, by the ordinance of Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty!), whereat Zubaydah marvelled as did all who were present. Then she walked with a swaying and graceful gait and danced and sported and flapped her wings, whilst all eyes were fixed on her and all marvelled at what she did. Then said she with fluent tongue, ""Is this goodly, O my ladies?""; and they replied, ""Yes, O Princess of the fair! All thou dost is goodly."" Said she, ""And this, O my mistresses, that I am about to do is better yet."" Then she spread her wings and flying up with her children to the dome of the palace, perched on the saloon-roof whilst they all looked at her, wide-eyed and said, ""By Allah, this is indeed a rare and peregrine fashion! Never saw we its like."" Then, as she was about to take flight for her own land, she bethought her of Hasan and said, ""Hark ye, my mistresses!"" and she improvised these couplets,
""O who bast quitted these abodes and faredst lief and light * To
       &nbsp    other objects of thy love with fain and fastest flight!
Deem'st thou that 'bided I with you in solace and in joy * Or
       &nbsp    that my days amid you all were clear of bane and blight?
When I was captive ta'en of Love and snarèd in his snare, * He
       &nbsp    made of Love my prison and he fared fro' me forthright:
So when my fear was hidden, he made sure that ne'er should I *
       &nbsp     Pray to the One, th' Omnipotent to render me my right:
He charged his mother keep the secret with all the care she
       &nbsp     could, * In closet shut and treated me with enemy's
       &nbsp     despight:
But I o'erheard their words and held them fast in memory * And
       &nbsp   hoped for fortune fair and weal and blessings infinite:
My faring to the Hammam-bath then proved to me the means * Of
       &nbsp   making minds of folk to be confounded at my sight:
Wondered the Bride of Al-Rashid to see my brilliancy * When she
       &nbsp   beheld me right and left with all of beauty dight:
Then quoth I, 'O our Caliph's wife, I once was wont to own * A
       &nbsp   dress of feathers rich and rare that did the eyes delight:
An it were now on me thou shouldst indeed see wondrous things *
       &nbsp  That would efface all sorrows and disperse all sores of
       &nbsp   sprite:'
Then deigned our Caliph's Bride to cry, 'Where is that dress of
       &nbsp    thine?' * And I replied, 'In house of him kept darkling as
       &nbsp   the night.'
So down upon it pounced Masrúr and brought it unto her, * And
       &nbsp   when 'twas there each feather cast a ray of beaming light:
Therewith I took it from his hand and opened it straightway * And
       &nbsp    saw its plumèd bosom and its buttons pleased my sight:
And so I clad myself therein and took with me my babes; * And
       &nbsp     spread my wings and flew away with all my main and might;
Saying, 'O husband's mother mine tell him when cometh he * An
       &nbsp     ever wouldest meet her thou from house and home must flee.""'
When she had made an end of her verses, the Lady Zubaydah said to her, ""Wilt thou not come down to us, that we may take our fill of thy beauty, O fairest of the fair? Glory be to Him who hath given thee eloquence and brilliance!"" But she said, ""Far be from me that the Past return should see!"" Then said she to the mother of the hapless, wretched Hasan, ""By Allah, O my lady, O mother of my husband, it irketh me to part from thee; but, whenas thy son cometh to thee and upon him the nights of severance longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see and whenas breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully, let him come in the islands of Wák to me."" Then she took flight with her children and sought her own country, whilst the old woman wept and beat her face and moaned and groaned till she swooned away. When she came to herself, she said to the Lady Zubaydah, ""O my lady, what is this thou hast done?"" And Zubaydah said to her, ""O my lady the pilgrimess, I knew not that this would happen and hadst thou told me of the case and acquainted me with her condition, I had not gainsaid thee. Nor did I know until now that she was of the Flying Jinn; else had I not suffered her to don the dress nor permitted her to take her children: but now, O my lady, words profit nothing; so do thou acquit me of offence against thee."" And the old woman could do no otherwise than shortly answer, ""Thou art acquitted.!"" Then she went forth the palace of the Caliphate and returned to her own house, where she buffeted her face till she swooned away, When she came to herself, she pined for her daughter-in-law and her grandchildren and for the sight of her son and versified with these couplets,
""Your faring on the parting-day drew many a tear fro' me, * Who
       &nbsp     must your flying from the home long mourn in misery:
And cried I for the parting pang in anguish likest fire * And
       &nbsp     tear-floods chafed mine eyelids sore that ne'er of tears
       &nbsp     were free;
'Yes, this is Severance, Ah, shall we e'er oy return of you? *
       &nbsp     For your departure hath deprived my power of privacy!'
Ah, would they had returned to me in covenant of faith * An they
       &nbsp     return perhaps restore of past these eyne may see.""
Then arising she dug in the house three graves and betook herself to them with weeping all whiles of the day and watches of the night; and when her son's absence was longsome upon her and grief and yearning and unquiet waxed upon her, she recited these couplets,
""Deep in mine eye-balls ever dwells the phantom-form of thee * My
       &nbsp     heart when throbbing or at rest holds fast thy memory:
And love of thee doth never cease to course within my breast, *
       &nbsp     As course the juices in the fruits which deck the branchy
       &nbsp     tree:
And every day I see thee not my bosom straightened is * And even
       &nbsp     censurers excuse the woes in me they see:
O thou whose love hath gotten hold the foremost in the heart * Of
       &nbsp     me whose fondness is excelled by mine insanity:
Fear the Compassionate in my case and some compassion show! *
       &nbsp     Love of thee makes me taste of death in bitterest pungency.""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-seventh Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan's mother bewept through the watches of the night and the whiles of the day her separation from her son and his wife and children. On this wise it fared with her; but as regards Hasan, when he came to the Princesses, they conjured him to tarry with them three months, after which long sojourn they gave him five loads of gold and the like of silver and one load of victual and accompanied him on his homeward way till he conjured them to return, whereupon they farewelled him with an embrace; but the youngest came up to him, to bid him adieu and clasping his neck wept till she fainted. Then she recited these two couplets,
""When shall the severance-fire be quenched by union, love, with
       &nbsp     you? * When shall I win my wish of you and days that were
       &nbsp     renew?
The parting-day affrighted me and wrought me dire dismay * And
       &nbsp     doubleth woe, O master mine, by the sad word 'Adieu.'""
Anon came forward the second Princess and embraced him and recited these two couplets,
""Farewelling thee indeed is like to bidding life farewell * And
       &nbsp     like the loss of Zephyr 'tis to lose thee far our
       &nbsp    sight:
Thine absence is a flaming fire which burneth up my heart * And
       &nbsp   in thy presence I enjoy the Gardens of Delight.""
Presently came forward the third and embraced him and recited these two couplets,
""We left not taking leave of thee (when bound to other goal) *
       &nbsp   From aught of ill intention or from weariness and dole:
Thou art my soul, my very soul, the only soul of me: * And how
       &nbsp    shall I farewell myself and say, 'Adieu my Soul?'""
After her came forward the fourth and embraced him and recited these two couplets,
""Nought garred me weep save where and when of severance spake he,
       &nbsp    * Persisting in his cruel will with sore persistency:
Look at this pearl-like ornament I've hung upon mine ear: * 'Tis
       &nbsp     of the tears of me compact, this choicest jewelry!""
In her turn came forward the fifth and embraced him and recited these two couplets,
""Ah, fare thee not; for I've no force thy faring to endure, * Nor
       &nbsp     e'en to say the word farewell before my friend is sped:
Nor any patience to support the days of severance, * Nor any
       &nbsp   tears on ruined house and wasted home to shed.""
Next came the sixth and embraced him and recited these two couplets,
""I cried, as the camels went off with them, * And Love pained my
       &nbsp    vitals with sorest pain:
Had I a King who would lend me rule * I'd seize every ship that
       &nbsp    dares sail the Main.""
Lastly came forward the seventh and embraced him and recited these couplets,
""When thou seest parting, be patient still, * Nor let foreign
       &nbsp     parts deal thy soul affright:
But abide, expecting a swift return, * For all hearts hold
       &nbsp     parting in sore despight.""
And eke these two couplets,
""Indeed I'm heartbroken to see thee start, * Nor can I farewell
       &nbsp     thee ere thou depart;
Allah wotteth I left not to say adieu * Save for fear that saying
       &nbsp     would melt your heart.""
Hasan also wept for parting from them, till he swooned, and repeated these couplets,
""Indeed, ran my tears on the severance-day * Like pearls I
       &nbsp     threaded in necklace-way
The cameleer drove his camels with song * But I lost heart,
       &nbsp    patience and strength and stay:
I bade them farewell and retired in grief * From tryst-place and
       &nbsp     camp where my dearlings lay:
I turned me unknowing the way nor joyed * My soul, but in hopes
       &nbsp     to return some day.
Oh listen, my friend, to the words of love * God forbid thy heart
       &nbsp     forget all I say!
O my soul when thou partest wi' them, part too * With all joys of
       &nbsp     life nor for living pray!""
Then he farewelled them and fared on diligently night and day, till he came to Baghdad, the House of Peace and Sanctuary of the Abbaside Caliphs, unknowing what had passed during his wayfare. At once entering his house he went in to his mother to salute her, but found her worn of body and wasted of bones, for excess of mourning and watching, weeping and wailing, till she was grown thin as a toothpick and could not answer him a word. So he dismissed the dromedaries then asked her of his wife and children and she wept till she fainted, and he seeing her in this state searched the house for them, but found no trace of them. Then he went to the store-closet and finding it open and the chest broken and the feather-dress missing, knew forthright that his wife had possessed herself thereof and flown away with her children. Then he returned to his mother and, finding her recovered from her fit, questioned her of his spouse and babes, whereupon she wept and said, ""O my son, may Allah amply requite thee their loss! These are their three tombs."" When Hasan heard these words of his mother, he shrieked a loud shriek and fell down in a fainting-fit in which he lay from the first of the day till noon-tide; whereupon anguish was added to his mother's anguish and she despaired of his life. However, after a-while, he came to himself and wept and buffeted his face and rent his raiment and went about the house clean distraught, reciting these two couplets,
""Folk have made moan of passion before me, of past years, * And
live and dead for absence have suffered pains and fears;
But that within my bosom I harbour, with mine eyes * I've never
seen the like of nor heard with mine ears.""
Then finishing his verses he bared his brand and coming up to his mother, said to her, ""Except thou tell me the truth of the case, I will strike off thy head and kill myself."" She replied, ""O my son, do not such deed: put up thy sword and sit down, till I tell thee what hath passed."" So he sheathed his scymitar and sat by her side, whilst she recounted to him all that had happened in his absence from first to last, adding, ""O my son, but that I saw her weep in her longing for the bath and feared that she would go and complain to thee on thy return, and thou wouldst be wroth with me. I had never carried her thither; and were it not that the Lady Zubaydah was wroth with me and took the key from me by force, I had never brought out the feather-dress, though I died for it. But thou knowest, O my son, that no hand may measure length with that of the Caliphate. When they brought her the dress, she took it and turned it over, fancying that somewhat might be lost thereof, but she found it uninjured; wherefore she rejoiced and making her children fast to her waist, donned the feather-vest, after the Lady Zubaydah had pulled off to her all that was upon herself and clad her therein, in honour of her and because of her beauty. No sooner had she donned the dress than she shook and becoming a bird, promenaded about the palace, whilst all who were present gazed at her and marvelled at her beauty and loveliness. Then she flew up to the palace roof and perching thereon, looked at me and said: 'Whenas thy son cometh to thee and the nights of separation upon him longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see and whenas the breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully let him leave his native land and journey to the Islands of Wak and seek me.' This, then, is her story and what befel in thine absence.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-eighth Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that as soon as Hasan's mother had made an end of her story, he gave a great cry and fell down in a fainting fit which continued till the end of day, when he revived and fell to buffeting his face and writhing on the floor like a scotched snake. His mother sat weeping by his head until midnight, when he came to himself and wept sore and recited these couplets',
""Pause ye and see his sorry state since when ye fain withdrew; *
       &nbsp    Haply, when wrought your cruelty, you'll have the grace to
       &nbsp    rue:
For an ye look on him, you'll doubt of him by sickness-stress *
       &nbsp    As though, by Allah, he were one before ye never knew.
He dies for nothing save for love of you, and he would be *
       &nbsp    Numbered amid the dead did not he moan and groan for you.
And deem not pangs of severance sit all lightly on his soul; *
       &nbsp    'Tis heavy load on lover-wight; 'twere lighter an ye slew.""
Then having ended his verse he rose and went round about the house, weeping and wailing, groaning and bemoaning himself, five days, during which he tasted nor meat nor drink. His mother came to him and conjured him, till he broke his fast, and besought him to leave weeping; but he hearkened not to her and continued to shed tears and lament, whilst she strove to comfort him and he heeded her not. Then he recited these couplets,
""Beareth for love a burden sore this soul of me, * Could break a
       &nbsp     mortal's back however strong that be;
I am distraught to see my case and languor grows * Making my day
       &nbsp   and night indifferent in degree:
I own to having dreaded Death before this day: * This day I hold
       &nbsp   my death mine only remedy.""
And Hasan ceased not to do thus till daybreak, when his eyes closed and he saw in a dream his wife grief-full and repentant for that which she had done. So he started up from sleep crying out and reciting these two couplets,
""Their image bides with me, ne'er quits me, ne'er shall fly; *
       &nbsp    But holds within my heart most honourable stead;
But for reunion-hope, I'd see me die forthright, * And but for
       &nbsp     phantom-form of thee my sleep had fled.""
And as morning morrowed he redoubled his lamentations. He abode weeping-eyed and heavy-hearted, wakeful by night and eating little, for a whole month, at the end of which he bethought him to repair to his sisters and take counsel with them in the matter of his wife, so haply they might help him to regain her. Accordingly he summoned the dromedaries and loading fifty of them with rarities of Al-Irak, committed the house to his mother's care and deposited all his goods in safe keeping, except some few he left at home. Then he mounted one of the beasts and set out on his journey single handed, intent upon obtaining aidance from the Princesses, and he stayed not till he reached the Palace of the Mountain of Clouds, when he went in to the damsels and gave them the presents in which they rejoiced. Then they wished him joy of his safety and said to him, ""O our brother, what can ail thee to come again so soon, seeing thou wast with us but two months since?"" Whereupon he wept and improvised these couplets,
""My soul for loss of lover sped I sight; * Nor life enjoying
       &nbsp    neither life's delight:
My case is one whose cure is all unknown; * Can any cure the sick
       &nbsp    but doctor wight?
O who hast reft my sleep-joys, leaving me * To ask the breeze
       &nbsp    that blew from that fair site,—
Blew from my lover's land (the land that owns * Those charms so
       &nbsp    sore a grief in soul excite),
'O breeze, that visitest her land, perhaps * Breathing her scent,
       &nbsp   thou mayst revive my sprite!'""
And when he ended his verse he gave a great cry and fell down in a fainting-fit. The Princesses sat round him, weeping over him, till he recovered and repeated these two couplets,
""Haply and happily may Fortune bend her rein * Bringing my love,
       &nbsp    for Time's a freke of jealous strain;
Fortune may prosper me, supply mine every want, * And bring a
       &nbsp    blessing where before were ban and bane.""
Then he wept till he fainted again, and presently coming to himself recited the two following couplets,
""My wish, mine illness, mine unease! by Allah, own * Art thou
       &nbsp   content? then I in love contented wone!
Dost thou forsake me thus sans crime or sin * Meet me in ruth, I
       &nbsp    pray, and be our parting gone.""
Then he wept till he swooned away once more and when he revived he repeated these couplets,
""Sleep fled me, by my side wake ever shows * And hoard of
       &nbsp     tear-drops from these eyne aye flows;
For love they weep with beads cornelian-like * And growth of
       &nbsp     distance greater dolence grows:
Lit up my longing, O my love, in me * Flames burning 'neath my
       &nbsp     ribs with fiery throes!
Remembering thee a tear I never shed * But in it thunder roars
       &nbsp     and leven glows.""
Then he wept till he fainted away a fourth time, and presently recovering, recited these couplets,
""Ah! for lowe of love and longing suffer ye as suffer we? * Say,
       &nbsp    as pine we and as yearn we for you are pining ye?
Allah do the death of Love, what a bitter draught is his! * Would
       &nbsp    I wot of Love what plans and what projects nurseth he!
Your faces radiant-fair though afar from me they shine, * Are
       &nbsp   mirrored in our eyes whatsoever the distance be;
My heart must ever dwell on the memories of your tribe; * And the
       &nbsp   turtle-dove reneweth all as oft as moaneth she:
Ho thou dove, who passest night-tide in calling on thy fere, *
       &nbsp    Thou doublest my repine, bringing grief for company;
And leavest thou mine eyelids with weeping unfulfilled * For the
       &nbsp     dearlings who departed, whom we never more may see:
I melt for the thought of you at every time and hour, * And I
       &nbsp     long for you when Night showeth cheek of blackest blee.""
Now when his sister heard these words and saw his condition and how he lay fainting on the floor, she screamed and beat her face and the other Princesses hearing her scream came out and learning his misfortune and the transport of love and longing and the passion and distraction that possessed him they questioned him of his case. He wept and told them what had befallen in his absence and how his wife had taken flight with her children, wherefore they grieved for him and asked him what she said at leave-taking. Answered he, ""O my sisters, she said to my mother, 'Tell thy son, whenas he cometh to thee and the nights of sever- ance upon him longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see, and whenas the winds of love and longing shake him dolefully, let him fare in the Islands of Wak to me."" When they heard his words they signed one to other with their eyes and shook their heads, and each looked at her sister, whilst Hasan looked at them all. Then they bowed their heads groundwards and bethought themselves awhile; after which they raised their heads and said, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!""; presently adding, ""Put forth thy hand to heaven and when thou reach thither, then shalt thou win to thy wife.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seven Hundred and Ninety-ninth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Princesses said to Hasan, ""Put forth thy hand to Heaven and when thou reach thither, then shalt thou win to wife and children,"" thereat the tears ran down his cheeks like rain and wet his clothes, and he recited these couplets,
""Pink cheeks and eyes enpupil'd black have dealt me sore
       &nbsp  despight; * And whenas wake overpowered sleep my patience
       &nbsp   fled in fright:
The fair and sleek-limbed maidens hard of heart withal laid waste
       &nbsp  * My very bones till not a breath is left for man to sight:
Houris, who fare with gait of grace as roes o'er sandy-mound: *
       &nbsp    Did Allah's saints behold their charms they'd doat thereon
       &nbsp    forthright;
Faring as fares the garden breeze that bloweth in the dawn. * For
       &nbsp   love of them a sore unrest and troubles rack my sprite:
I hung my hopes upon a maid, a loveling fair of them, * For whom
       &nbsp    my heart still burns with lowe in Lazá-hell they light;—
A       &nbsp dearling soft of sides and haught and graceful in her gait, *
Her grace is white as morning, but her hair is black as
       &nbsp    night:
She stirreth me! But ah, how many heroes have her cheeks *
       &nbsp    Upstirred for love, and eke her eyes that mingle black and
       &nbsp    white.""
Then he wept, whilst the Princesses wept for his weeping, and they were moved to compassion and jealousy for him. So they fell to comforting him and exhorting him to patience and offering up prayers for his reunion with his wife; whilst his sister said to him, ""O my brother, be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear and be patient; so shalt thou win thy will; for whoso hath patience and waiteth, that he seeketh attaineth. Patience holdeth the keys of relief and indeed the poet saith,
'Let destiny with slackened rein its course appointed fare! And
       &nbsp    lie thou down to sleep by night, with heart devoid of care;
For 'twixt the closing of an eye and th' opening thereof, God
       &nbsp     hath it in His power to change a case from foul to
       &nbsp   fair.""
So hearten thy heart and brace up thy resolve, for the son of ten years dieth not in the ninth. Weeping and grief and mourning gender sickness and disease; wherefore do thou abide with us till thou be rested, and I will devise some device for thy winning to thy wife and children, Inshallah—so it please Allah the Most High!"" And he wept sore and recited these verses,
""An I be healed of disease in frame, * I'm unhealed of illness in
       &nbsp     heart and sprite:
There is no healing disease of love, * Save lover and loved one
       &nbsp     to re-unite.""
Then he sat down beside her and she proceeded to talk with him and comfort him and question him of the cause and the manner of his wife's departure. So he told her and she said, ""By Allah, O my brother, I was minded to bid thee burn the feather-dress, but Satan made me forget it."" She ceased not to converse with him and caress him and company with him other ten days, whilst sleep visited him not and he delighted not in food; and when the case was longsome upon him and unrest waxed in him, he versified with these couplets,
""A beloved familiar o'erreigns my heart * And Allah's ruling
       &nbsp     reigns evermore:
She hath all the Arab's united charms * This gazelle who feeds on
       &nbsp    my bosom's core.
Though my skill and patience for love of her fail, * I weep
       &nbsp    whilst I wot that 'tis vain to deplore.
The dearling hath twice seven years, as though * She were moon of
       &nbsp     five nights and of five plus four.""
When the youngest Princess saw him thus distracted for love and longing for passion and the fever-heat of desire, she went in to her sisterhood weeping-eyed and woeful-hearted, and shedding copious tears threw herself upon them, kissed their feet and besought them to devise some device for bringing Hasan to the Islands of Wak and effecting his reunion with his wife and wees. She ceased not to conjure them to further her brother in the accomplishment of his desire and to weep before them, till she made them weep and they said to her, ""Hearten thy heart: we will do our best endeavour to bring about his reunion with his family, Inshallah!"" And he abode with them a whole year, during which his eyes never could retain their tears. Now the sisterhood had an uncle, brother-german to their sire and his name was Abd al-Kaddús, or Slave of the Most Holy; and he loved the eldest with exceeding love and was wont to visit her once a year and do all she desired. They had told him of Hasan's adventure with the Magian and how he had been able to slay him; whereat he rejoiced and gave the eldest Princess a pouch which contained certain perfumes, saying, ""O daughter of my brother, an thou be in concern for aught, or if aught irk thee, or thou stand in any need, cast of these perfumes upon fire naming my name and I will be with thee forthright and will do thy desire."" This speech was spoken on the first of Moharram; and the eldest Princess said to one of the sisterhood, ""Lo, the year is wholly past and my uncle is not come. Rise, bring me the fire-sticks and the box of perfumes."" So the damsel arose rejoicing and, fetching what she sought, laid it before her sister, who opened the box and taking thence a little of the perfume, cast it into the fire naming her unde's name; nor was it burnt out ere appeared a dust-cloud at the farther end of the Wady; and presently lifting, it discovered a Shaykh riding on an elephant, which moved at a swift and easy pace, and trumpeted under the rider. As soon as he came within sight of the Princesses, he began making signs to them with his hands and feet; nor was it long ere he reached the castle and, alighting from the elephant, came in to them, whereupon they embraced him and kissed his hands and saluted him with the salam. Then he sat down, whilst the girls talked with him and questioned him of his absence. Quoth he, ""I was sitting but now with my wife, your aunt, when I smelt the perfumes and hastened to you on this elephant. What wouldst thou, O daughter of my brother?"" Quoth she, ""O uncle, indeed we longed for thee, as the year is past and 'tis not thy wont to be absent from us more than a twelvemonth."" Answered he, ""I was busy, but I purposed to come to you to-morrow."" Wherefore they thanked him and blessed him and sat talking with him.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundredth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the girls sat down to chat with their uncle the eldest said to him ""O my uncle, we told thee the tale of Hasan of Bassorah, whom Bahram the Magian brought and how he slew the wizard and how, after enduring all manner of hardships and horrors, he made prize of the Supreme King's daughter and took her to wife and journeyed with her to his native land?"" Replied he, ""Yes, and what befel him after that?"" Quoth the Princess, ""She played him false after he was blest with two sons by her; for she took them in his absence and fled with them to her own country, saying to his mother: 'Whenas thy son returneth to thee and asketh for me and upon him the nights of severance longsome shall be and he craveth reunion and meeting to see and whenas the breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully, let him come in the Islands of Wak to me.'"" When Abd al-Kaddus heard this, he shook his head and bit his forefinger; then, bowing his brow groundwards he began to make marks on the earth with his finger-tips; after which he again shook his head and looked right and left and shook his head a third time, whilst Hasan watched him from a place where he was hidden from him. Then said the Princesses to their uncle, ""Return us some answer, for our hearts are rent in sunder."" But he shook his head at them, saying, ""O my daughters, verily hath this man wearied himself in vain and cast himself into grievous predicament and sore peril; for he may not gain access to the Islands of Wak."" With this the Princesses called Hasan, who came forth and, advancing to Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus, kissed his hand and saluted him. The old man rejoiced in him and seated him by his side; whereupon quoth the damsels, ""O uncle, acquaint our brother Hasan with that thou hast told us."" So he said to Hasan, ""O my son, put away from thee this peine forte et dure; for thou canst never gain access to the Islands of Wak, though the Flying Jinn and the Wandering Stars were with thee; for that betwixt thee and these islands are seven Wadys and seven seas and seven mighty mountains. How then canst thou come at this stead and who shall bring thee thither? Wherefore, Allah upon thee, O my son, do thou reckon thy spouse and sons as dead and turn back forthright and weary not thy sprite! Indeed, I give thee good counsel, an thou wilt but accept it."" Hearing these words from the Shaykh, Hasan wept till he fainted, and the Princesses sat round him, weeping for his weeping, whilst the youngest sister rent her raiment and buffeted her face, till she swooned away. When Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus saw them in this transport of grief and trouble and mourning, he was moved to ruth for them and cried, ""Be ye silent!"" Then said he to Hasan, ""O my son, hearten thy heart and rejoice in the winning of thy wish, an it be the will of Allah the Most High;"" presently adding, ""Rise, O my son, take courage and follow me."" So Hasan arose forthright and after he had taken leave of the Princesses followed him, rejoicing in the fulfilment of his wish. Then the Shaykh called the elephant and mounting, took Hasan up behind him and fared on three days with their nights, like the blinding leven, till he came to a vast blue mountain, whose stones were all of azure hue and amiddlemost of which was a cavern, with a door of Chinese iron. Here he took Hasan's hand and let him down and alighting dismissed the elephant. Then he went up to the door and knocked, whereupon it opened and there came out to him a black slave, hairless, as he were an Ifrit, with brand in right hand and targe of steel in left. When he saw Abd al-Kaddus, he threw sword and buckler from his grip and coming up to the Shaykh kissed his hand. Thereupon the old man took Hasan by the hand and entered with him, whilst the slave shut the door behind them; when Hasan found himself in a vast cavern and a spacious, through which ran an arched corridor and they ceased not faring on therein a mile or so, till it abutted upon a great open space and thence they made for an angle of the mountain wherein were two huge doors cast of solid brass. The old man opened one of them and said to Hasan, ""Sit at the door, whilst I go within and come back to thee in haste, and beware lest thou open it and enter."" Then he fared inside and, shutting the door after him, was absent during a full sidereal hour, after which he returned, leading a black stallion, thin of flank and short of nose, which was ready bridled and saddled, with velvet housings; and when it ran it flew, and when it flew, the very dust in vain would pursue; and brought it to Hasan, saying, ""Mount!"" So he mounted and Abd al-Kaddus opened the second door, beyond which appeared a vast desert. Then the twain passed through the door into that desert and the old man said to him, ""O my son, take this scroll and wend thou whither this steed will carry thee. When thou seest him stop at the door of a cavern like this, alight and throw the reins over the saddle-bow and let him go. He will enter the cavern, which do thou not enter with him, but tarry at the door five days, without being weary of waiting. On the sixth day there will come forth to thee a black Shaykh, clad all in sable, with a long white beard, flowing down to his navel. As soon as thou seest him, kiss his hands and seize his skirt and lay it on thy head and weep before him, till he take pity on thee and he will ask thee what thou wouldst have. When he saith to thee, 'What is thy want?' give him this scroll which he will take without speaking and go in and leave thee. Wait at the door other five days, without wearying, and on the sixth day expect him; and if he come out to thee himself, know that thy wish will be won, but, if one of his pages come forth to thee, know that he who cometh forth to thee, purposeth to kill thee; and—the Peace! For know, O my son, that whoso self imperilleth doeth himself to death;""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and First Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that after handing the scroll to Hasan, Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus told him what would befal him and said, ""Whoso self imperilleth doeth himself to death; but also who ventureth naught advantageth naught. However an thou fear for thy life, cast it not into danger of destruction; but, an thou fear not, up and do thy will, for I have expounded to thee the whole case. Yet shouldest thou be minded to return to thy friends, the elephant is still here and he will carry thee to my nieces, who will restore thee to thy country and return thee to thy home, and Allah will vouchsafe thee a better than this girl, of whom thou art enamoured."" Hasan answered the Shaykh, saying, ""And how shall life be sweet to me, except I win my wish? By Allah, I will never turn back, till I regain my beloved or my death overtake me!"" And he wept and recited these couplets,
""For loss of lover mine and stress of love I dree, * I stood
bewailing self in deep despondency.
Longing for him, the Spring-camp's dust I kissed and kissed, *
But this bred more of grief and galling reverie.
God guard the gone, who in our hearts must e'er abide * With
nearing woes and joys which still the farther flee.
They say me, 'Patience!' But they bore it all away: * On
parting-day, and left me naught save tormentry.
And naught affrighted me except the word he said, * 'Forget me
not when gone nor drive from memory.'
To whom shall turn I? hope in whom when you are lost? * Who were
my only hopes and joys and woes of me?
But ah, the pang of home-return when parting thus! * How joyed at
seeing me return mine enemy.
Then well-away! this 'twas I guarded me against! * And ah, thou
lowe of Love double thine ardency!
An fled for aye my friends I'll not survive the flight; * Yet an
they deign return, Oh joy! Oh ecstacy!
Never, by Allah tears and weeping I'll contain * For loss of you,
but tears on tears and tears will rain.""
When Abd al-Kaddus heard his verse he knew that he would not turn back from his desire nor would words have effect on him, and was certified that naught would serve him but he must imperil himself, though it lose him his life. So he said to him, ""Know, O my son, that the Islands of Wak are seven islands, wherein is a mighty host, all virgin girls, and the Inner Isles are peopled by Satans and Marids and warlocks and various tribesmen of the Jinn; and whoso entereth their land never returneth thence; at least none hath done so to this day. So, Allah upon thee, return presently to thy people, for know that she whom thou seekest is the King's daughter of all these islands: and how canst thou attain to her? Hearken to me, O my son, and haply Allah will vouchsafe thee in her stead a better than she."" ""O my lord,"" answered Hasan, though for the love of her I were cut in pieces yet should I but redouble in love and transport! There is no help but that I enter the Wak Islands and come to the sight of my wife and children; and Inshallah, I will not return save with her and with them."" Said the Shaykh, ""Then nothing will serve thee but thou must make the journey?"" Hasan replied ""Nothing! and I only ask of thee thy prayers for help and aidance; so haply Allah will reunite me with my wife and children right soon."" Then he wept for stress of longing and recited these couplets,
""You are my wish, of creatures brightest-light * I deem you lief
       &nbsp   as hearing, fain as sight:
You hold my heart which hath become your home * And since you
       &nbsp   left me, lords, right sore's my plight:
Then think not I have yielded up your love, * Your love which set
       &nbsp    this wretch in fierce affright:
You went and went my joy whenas you went; * And waned and wax'ed
       &nbsp   wan the brightest light:
You left me lone to watch the stars in woe: * Railing tears
       &nbsp    likest rain-drops infinite.
Thou'rt longsome to the wight, who pining lies * On wake,
       &nbsp    moon-gazing through the night,
O Night! Wind! an thou pass the tribe where they abide * Give
       &nbsp    them my greeting, life is fain of flight.
And tell them somewhat of the pangs I bear: * The loved one
       &nbsp   kenneth not my case aright.""
Then he wept with sore weeping till he fainted away; and when he came to himself, Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus said to him, ""O my son, thou hast a mother; make her not taste the torment of thy loss."" Hasan replied, ""By Allah, O my lord, I will never return except with my wife, or my death shall overtake me."" And he wept and wailed and recited these couplets,
""By Love's right! naught of farness thy slave can estrange * Nor
       &nbsp     am I one to fail in my fealty:
I suffer such pains did I tell my case * To folk, they'd cry,
       &nbsp     'Madness! clean witless is he!'
Then ecstasy, love-longing, transport and lowe! * Whose case is
       &nbsp     such case how shall ever he be?""
With this the old man knew that he would not turn from his purpose, though it cost him his life; so he handed him the scroll and prayed for him and charged him how he should do, saying ""I have in this letter given a strict charge concerning thee to Abú al-Ruwaysh, son of Bilkís, daughter of Mu'in, for he is my Shaykh and my teacher, and all, men and Jinn, humble themselves to him and stand in awe of him. And now go with the blessing of God."" Hasan forthright set out giving the horse the rein, and it flew off with him swiftlier than lightning, and stayed not in its course ten days, when he saw before him a vast loom black as night, walling the world from East to West. As he neared it, the stallion neighed under him, whereupon there flocked to it horses in number as the drops of rain, none could tell their tale or against them prevail, and fell to rubbing themselves against it. Hasan was affrighted at them and fared forwards surrounded by the horses, without drawing rein till he came to the cavern which Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus had described to him. The steed stood still at the door and Hasan alighted and bridged the bridle over the saddle-bow; whereupon the steed entered the cavern, whilst the rider abode without, as the old man had charged him, pondering the issue of his case in perplexity and distraction and unknowing what would befal him.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Second Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan, dismounting from the steed, stood at the cavern-mouth pondering the issue of his case and unknowing what might befal him. He abode standing on the same spot five days with their nights, sleepless, mournful, tearful-eyed; distracted, perplexed, pondering his severance from home and family, comrades and friends, with weeping eye-lids and heavy heart. Then he bethought him of his mother and of what might yet happen to him and of his separation from his wife and children and of all that he had suffered, and he recited these couplets,
""With you is my heart-cure a heart that goes; * And from
       &nbsp     hill-foot of eyelids the tear-rill flows:
And parting and sorrow and exile and dole * And farness from
       &nbsp     country and throe that o'erthrows:
Naught am I save a lover distracted by love, * Far parted from
       &nbsp     loved one and wilted by woes.
And 'tis Love that hath brought me such sorrow, say where * Is
       &nbsp     the noble of soul who such sorrow unknows?""
Hardly had Hasan made an end of his verses, when out came the Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh, a blackamoor and clad in black raiment, and at first sight he knew him by the description that Abd al-Kaddus had given him. He threw himself at his feet and rubbed his cheeks on them and seizing his skirt, laid it on his head and wept before him. Quoth the old man, ""What wantest thou, O my son?"" Whereupon he put out his hand to him with the letter, and Abu al-Ruwaysh took it and reentered the cavern, without making him any answer. So Hasan sat down at the cave-mouth in his place other five days as he had been bidden, whilst concern grew upon him and terror redoubled on him and restlessness gat hold of him, and he fell to weeping and bemoaning himself for the anguish of estrangement and much watching. And he recited these couplets,
""Glory to Him who guides the skies! * The lover sore in sorrow
       &nbsp     lies.
Who hath not tasted of Love's food * Knows not what mean its
       &nbsp     miseries.
Did I attempt to stem my tears * Rivers of blood would fount and
       &nbsp    rise.
How many an intimate is hard * Of heart, and pains in sorest
       &nbsp    wise!
An she with me her word would keep, * Of tears and sighs I'd fain
       &nbsp     devise,
But I'm forgone, rejected quite * Ruin on me hath cast her eyes.
At my fell pangs fell wildlings weep * And not a bird for me but
       &nbsp     cries.""
Hasan ceased not to weep till dawn of the sixth day, when Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh came forth to him, clad in white raiment, and with his hand signed to him to enter. So he went in, rejoicing and assured of the winning of his wish, and the old man took him by the hand and leading him into the cavern, fared on with him half a day's journey, till they reached an arched doorway with a door of steel. The Shaykh opened the door and they two entered a vestibule vaulted with onyx stones and arabesqued with gold, and they stayed not walking till they came to a great hall and a wide, paved and walled with marble. In its midst was a flower-garden containing all manner trees and flowers and fruits, with birds warbling on the boughs and singing the praises of Allah the Almighty Sovran; and there were four daises, each facing other, and in each dais a jetting fountain, at whose corners stood lions of red gold, spouting gerbes from their mouths into the basin. On each dais stood a chair, whereon sat an elder, with exceeding store of books before him and censers of gold, containing fire and perfumes, and before each elder were students, who read the books to him. Now when the twain entered, the elders rose to them and did them honour; whereupon Abu al-Ruwaysh signed to them to dismiss their scholars and they did so. Then the four arose and seating themselves before that Shaykh, asked him of the case of Hasan to whom he said, ""Tell the company thy tale and all that hath betided thee from the beginning of thine adventure to the end."" So Hasan wept with sore weeping and related to them his story with Bahram; whereupon all the Shaykhs cried out and said, ""Is this indeed he whom the Magian caused to climb the Mountain of Clouds by means of the vultures, sewn up in the camel-hide?"" And Hasan said, ""Yes."" So they turned to the Shaykh, Abu al-Ruwaysh and said to him, ""O our Shaykh, of a truth Bahram contrived his mounting to the mountaintop; but how came he down and what marvels saw he there?"" And Abu al-Ruwaysh said, ""O Hasan, tell them how thou camest down and acquaint them with what thou sawest of marvels."" So he told them all that had befallen him, first and last; how he had gotten the Magian into his power and slain him, how he had delivered the youth from him and sent him back to his own country, and how he had captured the King's daughter of the Jinn and married her; yet had she played him false and taken the two boys she had borne him and flown away; brief, he related to them all the hardships and horrors he had undergone; whereat they marvelled, each and every, and said to Abu al-Ruwaysh, ""O elder of elders, verily by Allah, this youth is to be pitied! But belike thou wilt aid him to recover his wife and wees.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Third Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan told his tale to the elders, they said to Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh, ""This youth is to be pitied and haply thou wilt aid him to recover his wife and wees."" He replied, ""O my brothers, in very sooth this is a grave matter and a perilous; and never saw I any loathe his life save this youth. You know that the Islands of Wak are hard of access and that none may come to them but at risk of life; and ye know also the strength of their people and their guards. Moreover I have sworn an oath not to tread their soil nor transgress against them in aught; so how shall this man come at the daughter of the Great King, and who hath power to bring him to her or help him in this matter?"" Replied the other, ""O Shaykh of Shaykhs, verily this man is consumed with desire and he hath endangered himself to bring thee a scroll from thy brother Abd al-Kaddus; wherefore it behoveth thee to help him."" And Hasan arose and kissed Abu al-Ruwaysh's feet and raising the hem of his garment laid it on his head, weeping and crying. ""I beseech thee, by Allah, to reunite me with my wife and children, though it cost me my life and my soul!"" The four elders all wept for his weeping and said to Abu al-Ruwaysh, ""Deal generously with this unhappy and show him kindness for the sake of thy brother Abd al-Kaddus and profit by this occasion to earn reward from Allah for helping him."" Quoth he, ""This wilful youth weeteth not what he undertaketh; but Inshallah! we will help him after the measure of our means, nor leave aught feasible undone."" When Hasan heard the Shaykh's word he rejoiced and kissed the hands of the five elders, one after other, imploring their aidance. Thereupon Abd al-Ruwaysh took inkcase and a sheet of paper and wrote a letter, which he sealed and gave to Hasan, together with a pouch of perfumed leather, containing incense and fire-sticks and other needs, and said to him, ""Take strictest care of this pouch, and whenas thou fallest into any strait, burn a little of the incense therein and name my name, whereupon I will be with thee forthright and save thee from thy stress."" Moreover, he bade one of those present fetch him an Ifrit of the Flying Jinn; and he did so incontinently; whereupon quoth Abu al-Ruwaysh to the fire-drake, ""What is thy name!"" Replied the Ifrit, ""Thy thrall is hight Dahnash bin Faktash."" And the Shaykh said ""Draw near to me!"" So Dahnash drew near to him and he put his mouth to his ear and said somewhat to him, whereat the Ifrit shook his head and answered, ""I accept, O elder of elders!"" Then said Abu al-Ruwaysh to Hasan, ""Arise, O my son, mount the shoulders of this Ifrit, Dahnash the Flyer; but, when he heaveth thee heavenwards and thou hearest the angels glorifying God a-welkin with 'Subhána Iláh,' have a care lest thou do the like; else wilt thou perish and he too."" Hasan replied, ""I will not say a word; no, never;"" and the old man continued, ""O Hasan, after faring with thee all this day, to-morrow at peep of dawn he will set thee down in a land cleanly white, like unto camphor, whereupon do thou walk on ten days by thyself, till thou come to the gate of a city. Then enter and enquire for the King of the city; and when thou comest to his presence, salute him with the salam and kiss his hand: then give him this scroll and consider well whatso he shall counsel thee,"" Hasan replied, ""Hearing and obeying,"" and rose up and mounted the Ifrit's shoulders, whilst the elders rose and offered up prayers for him and commended him to the care of Dahnash the Firedrake. And when he had perched on the Flyer's back the Ifrit soared with him to the very confines of the sky, till he heard the angels glorifying God in Heaven, and flew on with him a day and a night till at dawn of the next day he set him down in a land white as camphor, and went his way, leaving him there. When Hasan found himself in the land aforesaid with none by his side he fared on night and day for ten days, till he came to the gate of the city in question and entering, enquired for the King. They directed him to him and told him that his name was King Hassún, Lord of the Land of Camphor, and that he had troops and soldiers enough to fill the earth in its length and breadth. So he sought audience of him and, being admitted to his presence, found him a mighty King and kissed ground between his hands. Quoth the King, ""What is thy want?"" Whereupon Hasan kissed the letter and gave it to him. The King read it and shook his head awhile, then said to one of his officers, ""Take this youth and lodge him in the house of hospitality."" So he took him and stablished him in the guest-house, where he tarried three days, eating and drinking and seeing none but the eunuch who waited on him and who entertained him with discourse and cheered him with his company, questioning him of his case and how he came to that city; whereupon he told him his whole story, and the perilous condition wherein he was. On the fourth day, that eunuch carried him before the King, who said to him, ""O Hasan, thou comest to me, seeking to enter the Islands of Wak, as the Shaykh of Shaykhs adviseth me. O my son, I would send thee thither this very day, but that by the way are many perils and thirsty wolds full of terrors; yet do thou have patience and naught save fair shall befal thee, for needs must I devise to bring thee to thy desire, Inshallah! Know, O my son, that here is a mighty host, equipped with arms and steeds and warlike gear, who long to enter the Wak Islands and lack power thereto. But, O my son, for the sake of the Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh, son of Bilkis, the daughter of Mu'in, I may not send thee back to him unfulfilled of thine affair. Presently there will come to us ships from the Islands of Wak and the first that shall arrive I will send thee on board of her and give thee in charge to the sailors, so they may take care of thee and carry thee to the Islands. If any question thee of thy case and condition, answer him saying, 'I am kinsman to King Hassun, Lord of the Land of Camphor;' and when the ship shall make fast to the shore of the Islands of Wak and the master shall bid thee land, do thou land. Now as soon as thou comest ashore, thou wilt see a multitude of wooden settles all about the beach, of which do thou choose thee one and crouch under it and stir not. And when dark night sets in, thou wilt see an army of women appear and flock about the goods landed from the ship, and one of them will sit down on the settle, under which thou hast hidden thyself, whereupon do thou put forth thy hand to her and take hold of her and implore her protection. And know thou, O my son, that an she accord thee protection, thou wilt win thy wish and regain thy wife and children; but, if she refuse to protect thee, make thy mourning for thyself and give up all hope of life, and make sure of death for indeed thou art a dead man. Understand, O my son, that thou adventurest thy life and this is all I can do for thee, and—the peace!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Fourth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Hassun spake these words to Hasan and charged him as we have related, ending with, ""This is all I can do for thee and know that except the Lord of Heaven had aided thee, thou hadst not come hither!"" The youth wept till he swooned away, and when he recovered, he recited these two couplets,
""A term decreed my lot I 'spy; * And, when its days shall end, I
       &nbsp     die.
Though lions fought with me in lair * If Time be mine I'd beat
       &nbsp     them, I!""
Then having ended his verse he kissed the ground before the Sovran and said to him, ""O mighty King, how many days remain till the coming of the ships?"" Replied the other, ""In a month's time they will come and will tarry here, selling their cargueson, other two months, after which they will return to their own country; so hope not to set out save after three whole months."" Then the King bade him return to the house of hospitality and bade supply him with all that he needed of meat and drink and raiment fit for Kings. Hasan abode in the guest-house a month, at the end of which the vessels arrived and the King and the merchants went forth to them, taking Hasan with them. Amongst them he saw a ship with much people therein, like the shingles for number; none knew their tale save He who created them. She was anchored in mid-harbour and had cocks which transported her lading to the shore. So Hasan abode till the crew had landed all the goods and sold and bought and to the time of departure there wanted but three days; whereupon the King sent for him and equipped him with all he required and gave him great gifts: after which he summoned the captain of the great ship and said to him, ""Take this youth with thee in the vessel, so none may know of him save thou, and carry him to the Islands of Wak and leave him there; and bring him not back."" And the Rais said, ""To hear is to obey: with love and gladness!"" Then quoth the King to Hasan, ""Look thou tell none of those who are with thee in the ship thine errand nor discover to them aught of thy case; else thou art a lost man;"" and quoth he, ""Hearing and obedience!"" With this he farewelled the King, after he had wished him long life and victory over his enviers and his enemies; wherefore the King thanked him and wished him safety and the winning of his wish. Then he committed him to the captain, who laid him in a chest which he embarked in a dinghy, and bore him aboard, whilst the folk were busy in breaking bulk and no man doubted but the chest contained somewhat of merchandise. After this, the vessels set sail and fared on without ceasing ten days, and on the eleventh day they made the land. So the Rais set Hasan ashore and, as he walked up the beach, he saw wooden settles without number, none knew their count save Allah, even as the King had told him. He went on, till he came to one that had no fellow and hid under it till nightfall, when there came up a mighty many of women, as they were locusts over-swarming the land and they marched afoot and armed cap-à-pie in hauberks and strait-knit coats of mail hending drawn swords in their hands, who, seeing the merchandise landed from the ships, busied themselves therewith. Presently they sat down to rest themselves, and one of them seated herself on the settle under which Hasan had crouched: whereupon he took hold of the hem of her garment and laid it on his head and throwing himself before her, fell to kissing her hands and feet and weeping and crying, ""Thy protection! thy good-will!"" Quoth she, ""Ho, thou! Arise and stand up, ere any see thee and slay thee."" So he came forth and springing up kissed her hands and wept and said to her, ""O my mistress, I am under thy protection!""; adding, ""Have ruth on one who is parted from his people and wife and children, one who hath haste to rejoin them and one who adventureth life and soul for their sake! Take pity on me and be assured that therefor Paradise will be thy reward; or, an thou wilt not receive me, I beseech thee, by Allah the Great, the Concealer, to conceal my case!"" The merchants stared to see him talking with her; and she, hearing his words and beholding his humility, was moved to ruth for him; her heart inclined to him and she knew that he had not ventured himself and come to that place, save for a grave matter. So she said to him, ""O my son, be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear, hearten thy heart and take courage and return to thy hiding-place till the coming night, and Allah shall do as He will."" Then she took leave of him and Hasan crept under the wooden settle as before, whilst the troops lighted flambeaux of wax mixed with aloes-wood and Nadd-perfume and crude ambergris and passed the night in sport and delight till the morning. At daybreak, the boats returned to the shore and the merchants busied themselves with buying and selling and the transport of the goods and gear till nightfall, whilst Hasan lay hidden beneath the settle, weeping-eyed and woeful-hearted, knowing not what was decreed to him in the secret preordainment of Allah. As he was thus, behold, the merchant-woman with whom he had taken refuge came up to him and giving him a habergeon and a helmet, a spear, a sword and a gilded girdle, bade him don them and seat himself on the settle after which she left him, for fear of the troops. So he arose and donned the mail-coat and helmet and clasped the girdle about his middle; then he slung the sword over his shoulder till it hung under his armpit, and taking the spear in his hand, sat down on that settle, whilst his tongue neglected not to name Allah Almighty and call on Him for protection.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Fifth Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan received the weapons which the merchant-woman had given to him, saying, ""Sit thee upon the settle and let none wot thy case,"" he armed himself and took his seat, whilst his tongue neglected not to name Allah Almighty and to call upon Him for protection. And behold, there appeared cressets and lanthorns and flambeaux and up came the army of women. So he arose and mingling with them, became as one of them. A little before daybreak, they set out, and Hasan with them, and fared on till they came to their camp, where they dispersed each to her tent, and Hasan followed one of them and lo! it was hers for whose protection he had prayed. When she entered, she threw down her arms and doffed her hauberk and veil. So Hasan did the like and looking at his companion, saw her to be a grizzled old woman blue-eyed and big-nosed, a calamity of calamities, the foulest of all created things, with face pock-marked and eyebrows bald, gap-toothed and chap-fallen, with hair hoary, nose running and mouth slavering; even as saith the like of her the poet,
""In her cheek-corners nine calamities * Wone, and when shown,
       &nbsp   each one Jehannam is:
Hideous the face and favour foulest foul * As cheek of hog; yea,
       &nbsp     'tis a cesspool phiz.""
And indeed she was like a pied snake or a scald she-wolf. Now when the old woman looked at Hasan, she marvelled and said, ""How came this one to these lands and in which of the ships was he and how arrived he hither in safety?"" And she fell to questioning him of his case and admiring at his arrival, whereupon he fell at her feet and rubbed his face on them and wept till he fainted; and, when he recovered himself, he recited these couplets,
""When will Time grant we meet, when shall we be * Again united
       &nbsp     after severance stark?
And I shall win my choicest wish and view? * Blame end and Love
       &nbsp    abide without remark?
Were Nile to flow as freely as my tears, * 'Twould leave no
       &nbsp    region but with water-mark:
'Twould overthrow Hijaz and Egypt-land * 'Twould deluge Syria and
       &nbsp    'twould drown Irák.
This, O my love, is caused by thy disdain, * Be kind and promise
       &nbsp    meeting fair and fain!""
Then he took the crone's skirt and laid it on his head and fell to weeping and craving her protection. When she saw his ardency and transport and anguish and distress, her heart softened to him and she promised him her safeguard, saying, ""Have no fear whatsoever."" Then she questioned him of his case and he told her the manner of his coming thither and all that had befallen him from beginning to end, whereat she marvelled and said, ""This that hath betide thee, methinks, never betided any save thyself and except thou hadst been vouchsafed the especial protection of Allah, thou hadst not been saved: but now, O my son, take comfort and be of good courage; thou hast nothing more to fear, for indeed thou hast won thy wish and attained thy desire, if it please the Most High!"" Thereat Hasan rejoiced with joy exceeding and she sent to summon the captains of the army to her presence, and it was the last day of the month. So they presented themselves and the old woman said to them, ""Go out and proclaim to all the troops that they come forth to-morrow at daybreak and let none tarry behind, for whoso tarryeth shall be slain."" They replied, ""We hear and we obey,"" and going forth, made proclamation to all the host anent a review next morning, even as she bade them, after which they returned and told her of this; whereby Hasan knew that she was the Commander-in-chief of the army and the Viceregent in authority over them; and her name was Shawahí the Fascinator, entituled Umm al-Dawáhi, or Mother of Calamities. She ceased not to bid and forbid and Hasan doffed not off his arms from his body that day. Now when the morning broke, all the troops fared forth from their places, but the old woman came not out with them, and as soon as they were sped and the stead was clear of them, she said to Hasan, ""Draw near unto me, O my son."" So he drew near unto her and stood between her hands. Quoth she, ""Why and wherefore hast thou adventured thyself so boldly as to enter this land, and how came thy soul to consent to its own undoing? Tell me the truth and the whole truth and fear aught of ill come of it, for thou hast my plighted word and I am moved to compassion for thy case and pity thee and have taken thee under my protection. So, if thou tell me the truth, I will help thee to win thy wish, though it involve the undoing of souls and the destruction of bodies; and since thou hast come to seek me, no hurt shall betide thee from me, nor will I suffer any to have at thee with harm of all who be in the Islands of Wak."" So he told her his tale from first to last, acquainting her with the matter of his wife and of the birds; how he had captured her as his prize from amongst the ten and married her and abode with her, till she had borne him two sons, and how she had taken her children and flown away with them, whenas she knew the way to the feather-dress. Brief, he concealed from her no whit of his case, from the beginning to that day. But when Shawahi heard his relation, she shook her head and said to him, ""Glory be to God who hath brought thee hither in safety and made thee hap upon me! For, hadst thou happened on any but myself, thou hadst lost thy life without winning thy wish; but the truth of thine intent and thy fond affection and the excess of thy love-longing for thy wife and yearning for thy children, these it was that have brought thee to the attainment of thine aim. Didst thou not love her and love her to distraction, thou hadst not thus imperilled thyself, and Alhamdolillah—Praised be Allah—for thy safety! Wherefore it behoveth us to do thy desire and conduce to thy quest, so thou mayst presently attain that thou seekest, if it be the will of Almighty Allah. But know, O my son, that thy wife is not here, but in the seventh of the Islands of Wak and between us and it is seven months' journey, night and day. From here we go to an island called the Land of Birds, wherein, for the loud crying of the birds and the flapping of their wings, one cannot hear other speak.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Sixth Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the old woman said to Hasan, ""Indeed thy wife is in the Seventh Island, the greatest amongst the Islands of Wak and betwixt us and it is a seven-months' journey. From here we fare for the Land of Birds, whereon for the force of their flying and the flapping of their wings, we cannot hear one other speak. Over that country we journey night and day, eleven days, after which we come forth of it to another called the Land of Ferals where, for stress of roaring of lions and howling of wolves and laughing of hyaenas and the crying of other beasts of prey we shall hear naught, and therein we travel twenty days' journey. Then we issue therefrom and come to a third country, called the Land of the Jánn, where, for stress of the crying of the Jinn and the flaming of fires and the flight of sparks and smoke from their mouths and the noise of their groaning and their arrogance in blocking up the road before us, our ears will be deafened and our eyes blinded, so that we shall neither hear nor see, nor dare any look behind him, or he perisheth: but there horseman boweth head on saddle-bow and raiseth it not for three days. After this, we abut upon a mighty mountain and a running river contiguous with the Isles of Wak, which are seven in number and the extent whereof is a whole year's journey for a well-girt horseman. And thou must know, O my son, that these troops are all virgin girls, and that the ruler over us is a woman of the Archipelago of Wak. On the bank of the river aforesaid is another mountain, called Mount Wak, and it is thus named by reason of a tree which beareth fruits like heads of the Sons of Adam. When the sun riseth on them, the heads cry out all, saying in their cries:— 'Wak! Wak! Glory be to the Creating King, Al-Khallák!' And when we hear their crying, we know that the sun is risen. In like manner, at sundown, the heads set up the same cry, 'Wak! Wak! Glory to Al-Khallak!' and so we know that the sun hath set. No man may abide with us or reach to us or tread our earth: and betwixt us and the abiding-place of the Queen who ruleth over us is a month's journey from this shore, all the lieges whereof are under her hand, as are also the tribes of the Jinn, Marids and Satans, while of the warlocks none kenneth the number save He who created them. Wherefore, an thou be afraid, I will send with thee one who will convey thee to the coast and there bring one who will embark thee on board a ship that bear thee to thine own land. But an thou be content to tarry with us, I will not forbid thee and thou shalt be with me in mine eye, till thou win thy wish, Inshallah!"" Quoth he, ""O my lady, I will never quit thee till I foregather with my wife or lose my life!""; and quoth she, ""This is a light matter; be of good heart, for soon shalt thou come to thy desire, Allah willing; and there is no help but that I let the Queen know of thee, that she may help thee to attain thine aim."" Hasan blessed her and kissed her head and hands, thanking her for her good deed and exceeding kindness and firm will. Then he set out with her, pondering the issue of his case and the horrors of his strangerhood; wherefore he fell a-weeping and a-wailing and recited these couplets,
""A Zephyr bloweth from the lover's site; * And thou canst view me
       &nbsp   in the saddest plight:
The Night of Union is as brilliant morn; * And black the
       &nbsp   Severance-day as blackest night:
Farewelling friend is sorrow sorest sore * Parting from lover's
       &nbsp   merest undelight.
I will not blame her harshness save to her, * And 'mid mankind
       &nbsp   nor friend nor fere I sight:
How can I be consoled for loss of you? * Base censor's blame
       &nbsp   shall not console my sprite!
O thou in charms unique, unique's my love; * O peerless thou, my
       &nbsp   heart hath peerless might!
Who maketh semblance that be loveth you * And dreadeth blame is
       &nbsp   most blame-worthy wight.""
Then the old woman bade beat the kettle-drums for departure and the army set out. Hasan fared with her, drowned in the sea of solicitude and reciting verses like those above, whilst she strave to comfort him and exhorted him to patience; but he awoke not from his tristesse and heeded not her exhortations. They journeyed thus till they came to the boundaries of the Land of Birds and when they entered it, it seemed to Hasan as if the world were turned topsy-turvy for the exceeding clamour. His head ached and his mind was dazed, his eyes were blinded and his ears deafened, and he feared with exceeding fear and made certain of deaths saying to himself, ""If this be the Land of Birds, how will be the Land of Beasts?"" But, when the crone hight Shawahi saw him in this plight, she laughed at him, saying, ""O my son, if this be thy case in the first island, how will it fare with thee, when thou comest to the others?"" So he prayed to Allah and humbled himself before the Lord, beseeching Him to assist him against that wherewith He had afflicted him and bring him to his wishes; and they ceased not going till they passed out of the Land of Birds and, traversing the Land of Beasts, came to the Land of the Jann which when Hasan saw, he was sore affrighted and repented him of having entered it with them. But he sought aid of Allah the Most High and fared on with them, till they were quit of the Land of the Jann and came to the river and set down their loads at the foot of a vast mountain and a lofty, and pitched their tents by the stream-bank. Then they rested and ate and drank and slept in security, for they were come to their own country. On the morrow the old woman set Hasan a couch of alabaster, inlaid with pearls and jewels and nuggets of red gold, by the river-side, and he sat down thereon, having first bound his face with a chin-kerchief, that discovered naught of him but his eyes. Then she bade proclaim among the troops that they should all assemble before her tent and put off their clothes and go down into the stream and wash; and this she did that she might parade before him all the girls, so haply his wife should be amongst them and he know her. So the whole army mustered before her and putting off their clothes, went down into the stream, and Hasan seated on his couch watched them washing their white skins and frolicking and making merry, whilst they took no heed of his inspecting them, deeming him to be of the daughters of the Kings. When he beheld them stripped of their clothes, his chord stiffened for that looking at them mother-naked he saw what was between their thighs, and that of all kinds, soft and rounded, plump and cushioned; large-lipped, perfect, redundant and ample, and their faces were as moons and their hair as night upon day, for that they were of the daughters of the Kings. When they were clean, they came up out of the water, stark naked, as the moon on the night of fullness and the old woman questioned Hasan of them, company by company, if his wife were among them; but, as often as she asked him of a troop, he made answer, ""She is not among these, O my lady.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Seventh Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the old woman questioned Hasan of the girls, company after company, if haply his wife were among them; but as often as she asked him of a troop, he made answer, ""She is not among these, O my lady!"" Last of all, there came up a damsel, attended by ten slave-girls and thirty waiting-women, all of them high-bosomed maidens. They put off their clothes and went down into the river, where the damsel fell to riding the high horse over her women, throwing them down and ducking them. On this wise she continued for a full hour, after which all came up out of the water and sat down; and they brought her napkins of gold-purfled silk, with which she dried herself. Then they brought her clothes and jewels and ornaments of the handiwork of the Jinn, and she donned them and rose and walked with graceful pace among the troops, she and her maidens. When Hasan saw her, his heart was ready to fly from his breast and he said, ""Verily this girl is the likest of all folk to the bird I saw in the basin atop of the palace of my sisters the Princesses, and she lorded it over her lieges even as doth this one."" The old woman asked, ""O Hasan, is this thy wife?""; and he answered, ""No, by thy life, O my lady; this is not my wife, nor ever in my life have I set eyes on her; neither among all the girls I have seen in these islands is there the like of my wife nor her match for symmetry and grace and beauty and loveliness!"" Then said Shawaki, ""Describe her to me and acquaint me with all her attributes, that I may have her in my mind; for I know every girl in the Islands of Wak, being commander of the army of maids and governor over them; wherefore, an thou describe her to me, I shall know her and will contrive for thee to take her."" Quoth he, ""My wife hath the fairest face and a form all grace; smooth is she of cheeks and high of breasts with eyes of liquid light, calves and thighs plump to sight, teeth snowy white, with dulcet speech dight; in speech soft and bland as she were a willow-wand; her gifts are a moral and lips are red as coral; her eyes wear natural Kohl-dye and her lower labia in softness lie. On her right cheek is a mole and on her waist, under her navel, is a sign; her face shines as the rondure of the moon in sheen, her waist is slight, her hips a heavy weight, and the water of her mouth the sick doth heal, as it were Kausar or Salsabil."" Said the old woman, ""Give me an increased account of her, Allah increase thee of passion for her!"" Quoth he, ""My wife hath a face the fairest fair and oval cheeks the rarest rare; neck long and spare and eyes that Kohl wear; her side face shows the Anemones of Nu'uman, her mouth is like a seal of cornelian and flashing teeth that lure and stand one in stead of cup and ewer. She is cast in the mould of pleasantness and between her thighs is the throne of the Caliphate, there is no such sanctuary among the Holy Places; as saith in its praise the poet,
""The name of what drave me distraught * Hath letters renowned
       &nbsp  among men:
A four into five multiplied * And a multiplied six into
       &nbsp  ten.""
Then Hasan wept and chanted the following Mawwál,
""O heart, an lover false thee, shun the parting bane * Nor to
       &nbsp  forgetfulness thy thoughts constrain:
Be patient; thou shalt bury all thy foes; * Allah ne'er falseth
       &nbsp  man of patience fain.""
And this also,
""An wouldst be life,long safe, vaunt not delight; * Never
       &nbsp   despair, nor wone o'erjoyed in sprite!
Forbear, rejoice not, mourn not o'er thy plight * And in ill day
       &nbsp   'Have not we oped?'—recite.""
Thereupon the old woman bowed her head groundwards awhile, then, raising it, said, ""Laud be to the Lord, the Mighty of Award! Indeed I am afflicted with thee, O Hasan! Would Heaven I had never known thee! This woman, whom thou describest to me as thy wife, I know by description and I know her to be none other than the eldest daughter of the Supreme King, she who ruleth over all the Islands of Wak. So open both eyes and consider thy case; and if thou be asleep, awake; for, if this woman be indeed thy wife, it is impossible for thee ever to obtain her, and though thou come to her, yet couldst thou not avail to her possession, since between thee and her the distance is as that between earth and Heaven. Wherefore, O my son, return presently and cast not thyself into destruction nor cast me with thee; for meseemeth thou hast no lot in her; so return whence thou camest lest our lives be lost."" And she feared for herself and for him. When Hasan heard her words, he wept till he fainted and she left not sprinkling water on his face, till he came to himself, when he continued to weep, so that he drenched his dress with tears, for the much cark and care and chagrin which betided him by reason of her words. And indeed he despaired of life and said to the old woman, ""O my lady, and how shall I go back, after having come hither? Verily, I thought not thou wouldst forsake me nor fail of the winning of my wish, especially as thou art the Commander-in-chief of the army of the girls."" Answered Shawahl, ""O my son, I doubted not but thy wife was a maid of the maids, and had I known she was the King's daughter, I had not suffered thee to come hither nor had I shown the troops to thee, for all the love I bear thee. But now, O my son, thou hast seen all the girls naked; so tell me which of them pleaseth thee and I will give her to thee, in lieu of thy wife, and do thou put it that thy wife and children are dead and take her and return to thine own country in safety, ere thou fall into the King's hand and I have no means of delivering thee. So, Allah upon thee, O my son, hearken unto me. Choose thyself one of these damsels, in the stead of yonder woman, and return presently to thy country in safety and cause me not quaff the cup of thine anguish! For, by Allah, thou hast cast thyself into affliction sore and peril galore, wherefrom none may avail to deliver thee evermore!"" But Hasan hung down his head and wept with long weeping and recited these couplets,
""'Blame not!' said I to all who blamèd me; * 'Mine eye-lids
       &nbsp   naught but tears were made to dree:'
The tears that brim these orbs have overflowed * My checks, for
       &nbsp    lovers and love's cruelty.
Leave me to love though waste this form of me! * For I of Love
       &nbsp    adore the insanity:
And, Oh my dearling, passion grows on me * For you—and you, why
       &nbsp  grudge me clemency?
You wronged me after swearing troth and plight, * Falsed my
       &nbsp  companionship and turned to flee:
And cup of humbling for your rigours sore * Ye made me drain what
       &nbsp     day departed ye:
Then melt, O heart, with longing for their sight * And, O mine
       &nbsp    eyes, with crowns of tears be dight.""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Eighth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman said to Hasan, ""By Allah, O my son, hearken to my words! Choose thee one of these girls in lieu of thy wife and presently return to thy country in safety,"" he hung down his head and recited the couplets quoted above. Then he wept till he swooned away and Shawahl sprinkled water on his face till he revived, when she addressed him, ""O my lord, I have no shift left; because if I carry thee to the city thy life is lost and mine also: for, when the Queen cometh to know of this, she will blame me for admitting thee into her lands and islands, whereto none of Adam's sons hath access, and will slay me for bringing thee with me and for suffering mortal to look upon the virgins seen by thee in the sea, whom ne'er touched male, neither approached mate."" And Hasan sware that he had never looked on them with evil of eye. She resumed, ""O my son, hearken to me and return to thy country and I will give thee wealth and treasures and things of price, such as shall suffice thee for all the women in the world. Moreover, I will give thee a girl of the best of them, so lend an ear to my words and return presently and imperil not thyself; indeed I counsel thee with good counsel."" But he wept and rubbed both cheeks against her feet, saying, ""O my lady and mistress and coolth of mine eyes, how can I turn back now that I have made my way hither, without the sight of those I desire, and now that I have come near the beloved's site, hoping for meeting forthright, so haply there may be a portion in reunion to my plight?"" And he improvised these couplets,
""O Kings of beauty, grace to prisoner ta'en * Of eyelids fit to
       &nbsp   rule the Chosroës' reign:
Ye pass the wafts of musk in perfumed breath; * Your cheeks the
       &nbsp    charms of blooming rose disdain.
The softest Zephyr breathes where pitch ye camp * And thence
       &nbsp    far-scattered sweetness fills the plain:
Censor of me, leave blame and stint advice! * Thou bringest
       &nbsp    wearying words and wisdom vain:
Why heat my passion with this flame and up- * braid me when
       &nbsp    naught thou knowest of its bane?
Captured me eyes with passion maladifs, * And overthrew me with
       &nbsp   Love's might and main:
I scatter tears the while I scatter verse; * You are my theme for
       &nbsp   rhyme and prosy strain.
Melted my vitals glow of rosy cheeks * And in the Lazá-lowe my
       &nbsp    heart is lain:
Tell me, an I leave to discourse of you, * What speech my breast
       &nbsp    shall broaden?
Tell me deign! Life-long I loved the lovelings fair, but ah, * To
       &nbsp     grant my wish eke Allah must be fain!""
Hearing his verses the old woman was moved to ruth for him and Allah planted the seed of affection for him in her heart; so coming up to him she consoled him, saying, ""Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear and put away trouble from thy thought, for, by Allah, I will venture my life with thee, till thou attain thine aim or death undo me!"" With this, Hasan's heart was comforted and his bosom broadened and he sat talking with the old woman till the end of the day, when all the girls dispersed, some entering their town-mansions and others nighting in the tents. Then the old woman carried him into the city and lodged him in a place apart, lest any should come to know of him and tell the Queen of him and she should slay him and slay her who had brought him thither. Moreover, she served him herself and strave to put him in fear of the awful majesty of the Supreme King, his wife's father; whilst he wept before her and said, ""O my fady, I choose death for myself and loathe this worldly life, if I foregather not with my wife and children: I have set my existence on the venture and will either attain my aim or die."" So the old woman fell to pondering the means of bringing him and his wife together and casting about how to do in the case of this unhappy one, who had thrown himself into destruction and would not be diverted from his purpose by fear or aught else; for, indeed he reeked not of his life and the sayer of bywords saith, ""Lover in nowise hearkeneth he to the speech of the man who is fancy-free."" Now the name of the Queen of the island wherein they were was Núr al-Hudà, eldest daughter of the Supreme King, and she had six virgin sisters, abiding with their father, whose capital and court were in the chief city of that region and who had made her ruler over all the lands and islands of Wak. So when the ancient dame saw Hasan on fire with yearning after his wife and children, she rose up and repaired to the palace and going in to Queen Nur al-Huda kissed ground before her; for she had a claim on her favour because she had reared the King's daughters one and all and had authority over each and every of them and was high in honour and consideration with them and with the King. Nur al-Huda rose to her as she entered and embracing her, seated her by her side and asked her of her journey. She answered, ""By Allah, O my lady 'twas a blessed journey and I have brought thee a gift which I will presently present to thee,"" adding, ""O my daughter, O Queen of the age and the time, I have a favour to crave of thee and I fain would discover it to thee, that thou mayst help me to accomplish it, and but for my confidence that thou wilt not gainsay me therein, I would not expose it to thee."" Asked the Queen, ""And what is thy need? Expound it to me, and I will accomplish it to thee, for I and my kingdom and troops are all at thy commandment and disposition."" Therewithal the old woman quivered as quivereth the reed on a day when the storm-wind is abroad and saying in herself, ""O Protector, protect me from the Queen's mischief!"" fell down before her and acquainted her with Hasan's case, saying, ""O my lady, a man, who had hidden himself under my wooden settle on the seashore, sought my protection; so I took him under my safeguard and carried him with me among the army of girls armed and accoutred so that none might know him, and brought him into the city; and indeed I have striven to affright him with thy fierceness, giving him to know of thy power and prowess; but, as often as I threatened him, he weepeth and reciteth verses and sayeth, 'Needs must I have my wife and children or die, and I will not return to my country without them.' And indeed he hath adventured himself and come to the Islands of Wak, and never in all my days saw I mortal heartier of heart than he or doughtier of derring-do, save that love hath mastered him to the utmost of mastery.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Ninth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman related to Queen Nur al-Huda the adventure of Hasan, ending with, ""Never I saw any one heartier of heart than he save that love hath mastered him to the utmost of mastery,"" the Queen, after lending an attentive ear and comprehending the case, waxed wroth at her with exceeding wrath and bowed her head awhile groundwards; then, raising it, she looked at Shawahi and said to her, ""O ill-omened beldam, art thou come to such a pass of lewdness that thou carriest males, men, with thee into the Islands of Wak and bringest them into me, unfearing of my mischief? Who hath foregone thee with this fashion, that thou shouldst do thus? By the head of the King, but for thy claim on me for fosterage and service, I would forthwith do both him and thee to die the foulest of deaths, that travellers might take warning by thee, O accursed, lest any other do the like of this outrageous deed thou hast done, which none durst hitherto! But go and bring him hither forthright, that I may see him; or I will strike off thy head, O accursed."" So the old woman went out from her, confounded, unknowing whither she went and saying, ""All this calamity hath Allah driven upon me from this Queen because of Hasan!"" and going in to him, said, ""Rise, speak with the Queen, O wight whose last hour is at hand!"" So he rose and went with her, whilst his tongue ceased not to call upon Almighty Allah and say, ""O my God, be gracious to me in Thy decrees and deliver me from this Thine affliction!"" And Shawahi went with him charging him by the way how he should speak with the Queen. When he stood before Nur al-Huda, he found that she had donned the chinveil; so he kissed ground before her and saluted her with the salam, improvising these two couplets,
""God make thy glory last in joy of life; * Allah confirm the
       &nbsp   boons he deigned bestow:
Thy grace and grandeur may our Lord increase * And aye Th'
       &nbsp    Almighty aid thee o'er thy foe!""
When he ended his verse Nur al-Huda bade the old woman ask him questions before her, that she might hear his answers: so she said to him, ""The Queen returneth thy salam-greeting and saith to thee, 'What is thy name and that of thy country, and what are the names of thy wife and children, on whose account thou art come hither?""' Quoth he, and indeed he had made firm his heart and destiny aided him, ""O Queen of the age and tide and peerless jewel of the epoch and the time, my name is Hasan the fullfilled of sorrow, and my native city is Bassorah. I know not the name of my wife but my children's names are Násir and Mansúr."" When the Queen heard his reply and his provenance, she bespoke him herself and said, ""And whence took she her children?"" He replied, ""O Queen, she took them from the city of Baghdad and the palace of the Caliphate."" Quoth Nur al-Huda, ""And did she say naught to thee at the time she flew away?;"" and quoth he, ""Yes; she said to my mother, 'Whenas thy son cometh to thee and the nights of severance upon him longsome shall be and he craveth meeting and reunion to see, and whenas the breezes of love and longing shake him dolefully let him come in the Islands of Wak to me.'"" Whereupon Queen Nur al-Huda shook her head and said to him, ""Had she not desired thee she had not said to thy mother this say, and had she not yearned for reunion with thee, never had she bidden thee to her stead nor acquainted thee with her abiding-place."" Rejoined Hasan, ""O mistress of Kings and asylum of prince and pauper, whatso happened I have told thee and have concealed naught thereof, and I take refuge from evil with Allah and with thee; wherefore oppress me not, but have compassion on me and earn recompense and requital for me in the world to come, and aid me to regain my wife and children. Grant me my urgent need and cool mine eyes with my children and help me to the sight of them."" Then he wept and wailed and lamenting his lot recited these two couplets,
""Yea, I will laud thee while the ring-dove moans, * Though fail
       &nbsp    my wish of due and lawful scope:
Ne'er was I whirled in bliss and joys gone by * Wherein I found
       &nbsp    thee not both root and rope.""
The Queen shook her head and bowed it in thought a long time; then, raising it, she said to Hasan (and indeed she was wroth), ""I have ruth on thee and am resolved to show thee in review all the girls in the city and in the provinces of my island; and in case thou know thy wife, I will deliver her to thee; but, an thou know her not and know not her place, I will put thee to death and crucify thee over the old woman's door."" Replied Hasan, ""I accept this from thee, O Queen of the Age, and am content to submit to this thy condition. There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!"" And he recited these couplets,
""You've roused my desire and remain at rest,— * Waked my wounded
       &nbsp    lids while you slept with zest.
And ye made me a vow ye would not hang back * But your guile when
       &nbsp    you chained me waxt manifest.
I loved you in childhood unknowing Love; * Then slay me not who
       &nbsp     am sore opprest.
Fear ye not from Allah when slaying a friend * Who gazeth on
       &nbsp    stars when folk sleep their best?
By Allah, my kinsmen, indite on my tomb * 'This man was the slave
       &nbsp     of Love's harshest best!'
Haps a noble youth, like me Love's own thrall, * When he sees my
       &nbsp     grave on my name shall call.""
Then Queen Nur al-Huda commanded that not a girl should abide in the city but should come up to the palace and pass in review before Hasan and moreover she bade Shawahi go down in person and bring them up herself. Accordingly all the maidens in the city presented themselves before the Queen, who caused them to go in to Hasan, hundred after hundred, till there was no girl left in the place, but she had shown her to him; yet he saw not his wife amongst them. Then said she to him, ""Seest thou her amongst these?""; and he replied, ""By thy life, O Queen, she is not amongst them."" With this she was sore enraged against him and said to the old woman, ""Go in and bring out all who are in the palace and show them to him."" So she displayed to him every one of the palace-girls, but he saw not his wife among them and said to the Queen, ""By the life of thy head, O Queen, she is not among these."" Whereat the Queen was wroth and cried out at those around her, saying, ""Take him and hale him along, face to earth, and cut off his head, least any adventure himself after him and intrude upon us in our country and spy out our estate by thus treading the soil of our islands."" So they threw him down on his face and dragged him along; then, covering his eyes with his skirt, stood at his head with bared brands awaiting royal permission. Thereupon Shawahi came forward and kissing the ground before the Queen, took the hem of her garment and laid it on her head, saying, ""O Queen, by my claim for fosterage, be not hasty with him, more by token of thy knowledge that this poor wretch is a stranger, who hath adventured himself and suffered what none ever suffered before him, and Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty,) preserved him from death, for that his life was ordained to be long. He heard of thine equity and entered thy city and guarded site; wherefore, if thou put him to death, the report will dispread abroad of thee, by means of the travellers, that thou hatest strangers and slayest them. He is in any case at thy mercy and the slain of thy sword, if his wife be not found in thy dominions; and whensoever thou desireth his presence, I can bring him back to thee. Moreover, in very sooth I took him under my protection only of my trust in thy magnanimity through my claim on thee for fosterage, so that I engaged to him that thou wouldst bring him to his desire, for my knowledge of thy justice and quality of mercy. But for this, I had not brought him into thy kingdom; for I said to myself: 'The Queen will take pleasure in looking upon him, and hearing him speak his verses and his sweet discourse and eloquent which is like unto pearls strung on string.' Moreover, he hath entered our land and eaten of our meat; wherefore he hath a claim upon us.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Tenth Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen Nur al-Huda bade her pages seize Hasan and smite his neck, the old woman, Shawahi, began to reason with her and say, ""Verily he hath entered our land and eaten of our meat, wherefore he hath a claim upon us, the more especially since I promised him to bring him in company with thee; and thou knowest that, parting is a grievous ill and severance hath power to kill, especially separation from children. Now he hath seen all our women, save only thyself; so do thou show him thy face?"" The Queen smiled and said, ""How can he be my husband and have had children by me, that I should show him my face?"" Then she made them bring Hasan before her and when he stood in the presence, she unveiled her face, which when he saw, he cried out with a great cry and fell down fainting. The old woman ceased not to tend him, till he came to himself and as soon as he revived he recited these couplets,
""O breeze that blowest from the land Irak * And from their
       &nbsp     corners whoso cry 'Wak! Wak!'
Bear news of me to friends and say for me * I've tasted
       &nbsp     passion-food of bitter smack.
O dearlings of my love, show grace and ruth * My heart is melted
       &nbsp     for this severance-rack.""
When he ended his verse he rose and looking on the Queen's face, cried out with a great cry, for stress whereof the palace was like to fall upon all therein. Then he swooned away again and the old woman ceased not to tend him till he revived, when she asked him what ailed him and he answered, ""In very sooth this Queen is either my wife or else the likest of all folk to my wife.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Eleventh Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman asked Hasan what ailed him, he answered, ""In very sooth this Queen is either my wife or else the likest of all folk to my wife."" Quoth Nur al-Huda to the old woman, ""Woe to thee, O nurse! This stranger is either Jinn-mad or out of his mind, for he stareth me in the face with wide eyes and saith I am his wife."" Quoth the old woman, ""O Queen, indeed he is excusable; so blame him not, for the saying saith, 'For the lovesick is no remedy and alike are the madman and he.'"" And Hasan wept with sore weeping and recited these two couplets,
""I sight their track and pine for longing love; * And o'er their
       &nbsp    homesteads weep I and I yearn:
And I pray Heaven who will'ed we should part, * Will deign to
       &nbsp    grant us boon of safe return.""
Then said Hasan to the Queen once more, ""By Allah, thou art not my wife, but thou art the likest of all folk to her!"" Hereupon Nur al-Huda laughed till she fell backwards and rolled round on her side. Then she said to him, ""O my friend, take thy time and observe me attentively: answer me at thy leisure what I shall ask thee and put away from thee insanity and perplexity and inadvertency for relief is at hand."" Answered Hasan, ""O mistress of Kings and asylum of all princes and paupers, when I looked upon thee, I was distracted, seeing thee to be either my wife or the likest of all folk to her; but now ask me whatso thou wilt."" Quoth she, ""What is it in thy wife that resembleth me?""; and quoth he, ""O my lady, all that is in thee of beauty and loveliness, elegance and amorous grace, such as the symmetry of thy shape and the sweetness of thy speech and the blushing of thy cheeks and the jutting of thy breasts and so forth, all resembleth her and thou art her very self in thy faculty of parlance and the fairness of thy favour and the brilliancy of thy brow."" When the Queen heard this, she smiled and gloried in her beauty and loveliness and her cheeks reddened and her eyes wantoned; then she turned to Shawahi Umm Dawahi and said to her, ""O my mother, carry him back to the place where he tarried with thee and tend him thyself, till I examine into his affair; for, an he be indeed a man of manliness and mindful of friendship and love and affection, it behoveth we help him to win his wish, more by token that he hath sojourned in our country and eaten of our victual, not to speak of the hardships of travel he hath suffered and the travail and horrors he hath undergone. But, when thou hast brought him to thy house, commend him to the care of thy dependents and return to me in all haste; and Allah Almighty willing! all shall be well."" Thereupon Shawahi carried him back to her lodging and charged her handmaids and servants and suite wait upon him and bring him all he needed nor fail in what was his due. Then she returned to Queen Nur al-Huda, who bade her don her arms and set out, taking with her a thousand doughty horsemen. So she obeyed and donned her war-gear and having collected the thousand riders reported them ready to the Queen, who bade her march upon the city of the Supreme King, her father, there to alight at the abode of her youngest sister, Manár al-Saná and say to her, ""Clothe thy two sons in the coats of mail which their aunt hath made them and send them to her; for she longeth for them."" Moreover the Queen charged her keep Hasan's affair secret and say to Manar al-Sana, after securing her children, ""Thy sister inviteth thee to visit her."" ""Then,"" she continued, ""bring the children to me in haste and let her follow at her leisure. Do thou come by a road other than her road and journey night and day and beware of discovering this matter to any. And I swear by all manner oaths that, if my sister prove to be his wife and it appear that her children are his, I will not hinder him from taking her and them and departing with them to his own country.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Twelfth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Oueen said, ""I swear by Allah and by all manner of oaths that if she prove to be his wife, I will not hinder him from taking her but will aid him thereto and eke to departing with them to his mother-land."" And the old woman put faith in her words, knowing not what she purposed in her mind, for the wicked Jezebel had resolved that if she were not his wife she would slay him; but if the children resembled him, she would believe him. The Queen resumed, ""O my mother, an my thought tell me true, my sister Manar al-Sana is his wife, but Allah alone is All-knowing! seeing that these traits of surpassing beauty and excelling grace, of which he spoke, are found in none except my sisters and especially in the youngest."" The old woman kissed her hand and returning to Hasan, told him what the Queen had said, whereat he was like to fly for joy and coming up to her, kissed her head. Quoth she, ""O my son, kiss not my head, but kiss me on the mouth and be this kiss by way of sweetmeat for thy salvation. Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear and grudge not to kiss my mouth, for I and only I was the means of thy foregathering with her. So take comfort, and hearten thy heart and broaden thy breast and gladden thy glance and console thy soul for, Allah willing, thy desire shall be accomplished at my hand."" So saying, she bade him farewell and departed, whilst he recited these two couplets,
""Witnesses unto love of thee I've four; * And wants each case two
       &nbsp    witnesses; no more!
A heart aye fluttering, limbs that ever quake, * A wasted frame
       &nbsp   and tongue that speech forswore.""
And also these two,
""Two things there be, an blood-tears thereover * Wept eyes till
       &nbsp   not one trace thou couldst discover,
Eyes ne'er could pay the tithe to them is due * The prime of
       &nbsp   youth and severance from lover.""
Then the old woman armed herself and, taking with her a thousand weaponed horsemen, set out and journeyed till she came to the island and the city where dwelt the Lady Manar al-Sana and between which and that of her sister Queen Nur al-Huda was three days' journey. When Shawahi reached the city, she went in to the Princess and saluting her, gave her her sister's salam and acquainted her with the Queen's longing for her and her children and that she reproached her for not visiting her. Quoth Manar al-Sana, ""Verily, I am beholden to my sister and have failed of my duty to her in not visiting her, but I will do so forthright."" Then she bade pitch her tents without the city and took with her for her sister a suitable present of rare things. Presently, the King her father looked out of a window of his palace, and seeing the tents pitched by the road, asked of them, and they answered him, ""The Princess Manar al-Sana hath pitched her tents by the way-side, being minded to visit her sister Queen Nur al-Huda."" When the King heard this, he equipped troops to escort her to her sister and brought out to her from his treasuries meat and drink and monies and jewels and rarities which beggar description. Now the King had seven daughters, all sisters-german by one mother and father except the youngest: the eldest was called Núr al-Hudà, the second Najm al-Sabáh, the third Shams al-Zuhà, the fourth Shajarat al-Durr, the fifth Kút al-Kulúb, the sixth Sharaf al-Banát and the youngest Manar al-Sana, Hasan's wife, who was their sister by the father's side only. Anon the old woman again presented herself and kissed ground before the Princess, who said to her, ""Hast thou any need, O my mother?"" Quoth Shawahi, ""Thy sister, Queen Nur al-Huda, biddeth thee clothe thy sons in the two habergeons which she fashioned for them and send them to her by me, and I will take them and forego thee with them and be the harbinger of glad tidings and the announcer of thy coming to her."" When the Princess heard these words, her colour changed and she bowed her head a long while, after which she shook it and looking up, said to the old woman, ""O my mother, my vitals tremble and my heart fluttereth when thou namest my children; for, from the time of their birth none hath looked on their faces either Jinn or man, male or female, and I am jealous for them of the zephyr when it breatheth in the night."" Exclaimed the old woman, ""What words are these, O my lady? Dost thou fear for them from thy sister?""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Thirteenth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the old woman said to the Princess Manar al-Sana, ""What words be these, O my lady? Dost thou fear for them from thy sister? Allah safeguard thy reason! Thou mayst not cross the Queen's majesty in this matter, for she would be wroth with thee. However, O my lady, the children are young, and thou art excusable in fearing for them, for those that love well are wont to deem ill: but, O my daughter, thou knowest my tenderness and mine affection for thee and thy children, for indeed I reared thee before them. I will take them in my charge and make my cheek their pillow and open my heart and set them within, nor is it needful to charge me with care of them in the like of this case; so be of cheerful heart and tearless eye and send them to her, for, at the most, I shall but precede thee with them a day or at most two days."" And she ceased not to urge her, till she gave way, fearing her sister's fury and unknowing what lurked for her in the dark future, and consented to send them with the old woman. So she called them and bathed them and equipped them and changed their apparel. Then she clad them in the two little coats of mail and delivered them to Shawahi, who took them and sped on with them like a bird, by another road than that by which their mother should travel, even as the Queen had charged her; nor did she cease to fare on with all diligence, being fearful for them, till she came in sight of Nur al-Huda's city, when she crossed the river and entering the town, carried them in to their aunt. The Queen rejoiced at their sight and embraced them, and pressed them to her breast; after which she seated them, one upon the right thigh and the other upon the left; and turning round said to the old woman, ""Fetch me Hasan forthright, for I have granted him my safeguard and have spared him from my sabre and he hath sought asylum in my house and taken up his abode in my courts, after having endured hardships and horrors and passed through all manner mortal risks, each terribler than other; yet hitherto is he not safe from drinking the cup of death and from cutting off his breath."" —And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Fourteenth Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen Nur al-Huda bade the old woman bring Hasan she said, ""Verily he hath endured hardships and horrors and passed through all manner mortal risks each terribler than other; yet hitherto he is not safe from death and from the cutting off of his breath."" Replied Shawahi, ""An I bring him to thee, wilt thou reunite him with these his children? Or, if they prove not his, wilt thou pardon him and restore him to his own country?"" Hearing these her words the Queen waxed exceeding wroth and cried to her, ""Fie upon thee, O ill-omened old woman! How long wilt thou false us in the matter of this strange man who hath dared to intrude himself upon us and hath lifted our veil and pried into our conditions? Say me: thinkest thou that he shall come to our land and look upon our faces and betray our honour, and after return in safety to his own country and expose our affairs to his people, wherefore our report will be bruited abroad among all the Kings of the quarters of the earth and the merchants will journey bearing tidings of us in all directions, saying, 'A mortal entered the Isles of Wak and traversed the Land of the Jinn and the lands of the Wild Beasts and the Islands of Birds and set foot in the country of the Warlocks and the Enchanters and returned in safety?' This shall never be; no, never; and I swear by Him who made the Heavens and builded them; yea, by Him who dispread the earth and smoothed it, and who created all creatures and counted them, that, an they be not his children, I will assuredly slay him and strike his neck with mine own hand!"" Then she cried out at the old woman, who fell down for fear; and set upon her the Chamberlain and twenty Mamelukes, saying, ""Go with this crone and fetch me in haste the youth who is in her house."" So they dragged Shawahi along, yellow with fright and with side-muscles quivering, till they came to her house, where she went in to Hasan, who rose to her and kissed her hands and saluted her. She returned not his salam, but said to him, ""Come; speak the Queen. Did I not say to thee: 'Return presently to thine own country and I will give thee that to which no mortal may avail?' And did I forbid thee from all this? But thou wouldst not obey me nor listen to my words; nay, thou rejectedst my counsel and chosest to bring destruction on me and on thyself. Up, then, and take that which thou hast chosen; for death is near hand. Arise: speak with yonder vile harlot and tyrant that she is!"" So Hasan arose, broken-spirited, heavy, hearted, and full of fear, and crying, ""O Preserver, preserve Thou me! O my God, be gracious to me in that which Thou hast decreed to me of Thine affliction and protect me, O Thou the most Merciful of the Mercifuls!"" Then, despairing of his life, he followed the twenty Mamelukes, the Chamberlain and the crone to the Queen's presence, where he found his two sons Nasir and Mansur sitting in her lap, whilst she played and made merry with them. As soon as his eyes fell on them, he knew them and crying a great cry fell down a-fainting for excess of joy at the sight of his children.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Fifteenth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan's eyes fell upon his two sons, he knew them both and crying a great cry fell down a-fainting. They also knew him and natural affection moved them so that they freed themselves from the Queen's lap and fell upon Hasan, and Allah (to whom belong Might and Majesty,) made them speak and say to him, ""O our father!"" Whereupon the old woman and all who were present wept for pity and tenderness over them and said, ""Praised be Allah, who hath reunited you with your Sire!"" Presently, Hasan came to himself and embracing his children, wept till again he swooned away, and when he revived, he recited these verses,
""By rights of you, this heart of mine could ne'er aby * Severance
       &nbsp   from you albeit Union death imply!
Your phantom saith to me, 'A-morrow we shall meet!' * Shall I
       &nbsp  despite the foe the morrow-day espy?
By rights of you I swear, my lords, that since the day * Of
       &nbsp  severance ne'er the sweets of lips enjoyèd I!
An Allah bade me perish for the love of you, * Mid greatest
       &nbsp  martyrs for your love I lief will die.
Oft a gazelle doth make my heart her browsing stead * The while
       &nbsp    her form of flesh like sleep eludes mine eye:
If in the lists of Law my bloodshed she deny, * Prove it two
       &nbsp    witnesses those cheeks of ruddy dye.""
When Nur al-Huda was assured that the little ones were indeed Hasan's children and that her sister, the Princess Manar al-Sana, was his wife, of whom he was come in quest, she was wroth against her with wrath beyond measure.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Sixteenth Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nur al-Huda was certified that the little ones were Hasan's children and that her sister Manar al-Sana was his wife of whom he had come in quest, she raged with exceeding rage, too great to be assuaged and screamed in Hasan's face and reviled him and kicked him in the breast, so that he fell on his back in a swoon. Then she cried out at him, saying, ""Arise! fly for thy life. But that I swore that no evil should betide thee from me, should thy tale prove true, I would slay thee with mine own hand forthright!"" And she cried out at the old woman, who fell on her face for fear, and said to her, ""By Allah, but that I am loath to break the oath that I swore, I would put both thee and him to death after the foulest fashion!""; presently adding, ""Arise, go out from before me in safety and return to thine own country, for I swear by my fortune, if ever mine eye espy thee or if any bring thee in to me after this, I will smite off thy head and that of whoso bringeth thee!"" Then she cried out to her officers, saying, ""Put him out from before me!"" So they thrust him out, and when he came to himself, he recited these couplets,
""You're far, yet to my heart you're nearest near; * Absent yet
       &nbsp    present in my sprite you appear:
By Allah, ne'er to other I've inclined * But tyranny of Time in
       &nbsp    patience bear!
Nights pass while still I love you and they end, * And burns my
       &nbsp    breast with flames of fell Sa'ir;
I was a youth who parting for an hour * Bore not, then what of
       &nbsp    months that make a year?
Jealous am I of breeze-breath fanning thee; * Yea jealous-mad of
       &nbsp    fair soft-sided fere!""
Then he once more fell down in a swoon, and when he came to himself, he found himself without the palace whither they had dragged him on his face; so he rose, stumbling over his skirts and hardly crediting his escape from Nur al-Huda. Now this was grievous to Shawahi; but she dared not remonstrate with the Queen by reason of the violence of her wrath. And forthright Hasan went forth, distracted and knowing not whence to come or whither to go; the world, for all its wideness, was straitened upon him and he found none to speak a kind word with him and comfort him, nor any to whom he might resort for counsel or to apply for refuge; wherefore he made sure of death for that he could not journey to his own country and knew none to travel with him, neither wist he the way thither nor might he pass through the Wady of the Jann and the Land of Beasts and the Islands of Birds. So giving himself up for lost he bewept himself, till he fainted, and when he revived, he bethought him of his children and his wife and of that might befal her with her sister, repenting him of having come to those countries and of having hearkened to none, and recited these couplets,
""Suffer mine eye-babes weep lost of love and tears express: *
       &nbsp   Rare is my solace and increases my distress:
The cup of Severance-chances to the dregs I've drained; * Who is
       &nbsp   the man to bear love-loss with manliness?
Ye spread the Carpet of Disgrace betwixt us twain; * Ah,
       &nbsp   when shalt be uprolled, O Carpet of Disgrace?
I watched the while you slept; and if you deemed that I * Forgot
       &nbsp   your love I but forget forgetfulness:
Woe's me! indeed my heart is pining for the love * Of you, the
       &nbsp     only leaches who can cure my case:
See ye not what befel me from your fell disdain? * Debased am I
       &nbsp     before the low and high no less.
I hid my love of you but longing laid it bare, * And burns my
       &nbsp     heart wi' fire of passion's sorest stress:
Ah! deign have pity on my piteous case, for I * Have kept our
       &nbsp     troth in secresy and patent place!
Would Heaven I wot shall Time e'er deign us twain rejoin! * You
       &nbsp     are my heart's desire, my sprite's sole happiness:
My vitals bear the Severance-wound: would Heaven that you * With
       &nbsp     tidings from your camp would deign my soul to bless!""
Then he went on, till he came without the city, where he found the river, and walked along its bank, knowing not whither he went. Such was Hasan's case; but as regards his wife Manar al-Sana, as she was about to carry out her purpose and to set out, on the second day after the departure of the old woman with her children, behold, there came in to her one of the chamberlains of the King her sire, and kissed ground between his hands,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Seventeenth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Manar al-Sana was about to set out upon the journey, behold, a chamberlain of the King, her sire, came in to her and kissing the ground before her, said, ""O Princess, the Supreme King, thy father saluteth thee and biddeth thee to him."" So she rose and accompanied the chamberlain to learn what was required by her father, who seated her by his side on the couch, and said to her, ""O my daughter, know that I have this night had a dream which maketh me fear for thee and that long sorrow will betide thee from this thy journey."" Quoth she, ""How so, O my father, and what didst thou see in thy dream?"" and quoth he, ""I dreamt that I entered a hidden hoard, wherein was great store of monies, of jewels, of jacinths and of other riches; but 'twas as if naught pleased me of all this treasure and jewelry save seven bezels, which were the finest things there. I chose out one of the seven jewels, for it was the smallest, finest and most lustrous of them and its water pleased me; so I took it in my hand-palm and fared forth of the treasury. When I came without the door, I opened my hand, rejoicing, and turned over the jewel, when, behold, there swooped down on me out of the welkin a strange bird from a far land (for it was not of the birds of our country) and, snatching it from my hand, returned with it whence it came. Whereupon sorrow and concern and sore vexation overcame me and my exceeding chagrin so troubled me that I awoke, mourning and lamenting for the loss of the jewel. At once on awaking I summoned the interpreters and expounders of dreams and declared to them my dream, and they said to me: 'Thou hast seven daughters, the youngest of whom thou wilt lose, and she will be taken from thee perforce, without thy will.' Now thou, O my girl, art the youngest and dearest of my daughters and the most affectionate of them to me, and look'ye thou art about to journey to thy sister, and I know not what may befal thee from her; so go thou not; but return to thy palace."" But when the Princess heard her father's words, her heart fluttered and she feared for her children and bent earthwards her head awhile: then she raised it and said to her sire, ""O King, Queen Nur al-Huda hath made ready for me an entertainment and awaiteth my coming to her, hour by hour. These four years she hath not seen me and if I delay to visit her, she will be wroth with me. The utmost of my stay with her shall be a month and then I will return to thee. Besides, who is the mortal who can travel our land and make his way to the Islands of Wak? Who can gain access to the White Country and the Black Mountain and come to the Land of Camphor and the Castle of Crystal, and how shall he traverse the Island of Birds and the Wady of Wild Beasts and the Valley of the Jann and enter our Islands? If any stranger came hither, he would be drowned in the seas of destruction: so be of good cheer and eyes without a tear anent my journey; for none may avail to tread our earth."" And she ceased not to persuade him, till he deigned give her leave to depart.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Eighteenth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Princess ceased not to persuade him till he deigned give her leave to depart, and bade a thousand horse escort her to the river and abide there, till she entered her sister's city and palace and returned to them, when they should take her and carry her back to him. Moreover, he charged her tarry with her sister but two days and return to him in haste; and she answered, ""Hearing and obedience."" Then rising up she went forth and he with her and farewelled her. Now his words had sunken deep into her heart and she feared for her children; but it availeth not to fortify herself by any device against the onset of Destiny. So she set out and fared on diligently three days, till she came to the river and pitched her tents on its bank. Then she crossed the stream, with some of her counsellors, pages and suite and, going up to the city and the palace, went in to Queen Nur al-Huda, with whom she found her children who ran to her weeping and crying out, ""O our father!"" At this, the tears railed from her eyes and she wept; then she strained them to her bosom, saying, ""What! Have you seen your sire at this time? Would the hour had never been, in which I left him! If I knew him to be in the house of the world, I would carry you to him."" Then she bemoaned herself and her husband and her children weeping and reciting these couplets,
""My friends, despight this distance and this cruelty, * I pine
       &nbsp    for you, incline to you where'er you be.
My glance for ever turns toward your hearth and home * And mourns
       &nbsp    my heart the bygone days you woned with me,
How many a night foregathered we withouten fear * One loving,
       &nbsp   other faithful ever, fain and free!""
When her sister saw her fold her children to her bosom, saying, ""'Tis I who have done thus with myself and my children and have ruined my own house!"" she saluted her not, but said to her, ""O whore, whence haddest thou these children? Say, hast thou married unbeknown to thy sire or hast thou committed fornication? An thou have played the piece, it behoveth thou be exemplarily punished; and if thou have married sans our knowledge, why didst thou abandon thy husband and separate thy sons from thy sire and bring them hither?""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Nineteenth Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that quoth Nur al-Huda, the Queen, to her sister Manar al-Sana, the Princess, ""An thou have married sans our knowledge, why didst thou abandon thy husband and separate thy sons from their sire and bring them to our land? Thou hast hidden thy children from us. Thinkest thou we know not of this? Allah Almighty, He who is cognisant of the concealed, hath made known to us thy case and revealed thy condition and bared thy nakedness."" Then she bade her guards seize her and pinion her elbows and shackle her with shackles of iron. So they did as she commanded and she beat her with a grievous beating, so that her skin was torn, and hanged her up by the hair; after which she cast her in prison and wrote the King her father a writ acquainting him with her case and saying, ""There hath appeared in our land a man, a mortal, by name Hasan, and our sister Manar al-Sana avoucheth that she is lawfully married to him and bare him two sons, whom she hath hidden from us and thee; nor did she discover aught of herself till there came to us this man and informed us that he wedded her and she tarried with him a long while; after which she took her children and departed, without his knowledge, bidding as she went his mother tell her son, whenas longing began to rack to come to her in the Islands of Wak. So we laid hands on the man and sent the old woman Shawahi to fetch her and her offspring, enjoining her to bring us the children in advance of her. And she did so, whilst Manar al-Sana equipped herself and set out to visit me. When the boys were brought to me and ere the mother came, I sent for Hasan the mortal who claimeth her to wife, and he on entering and at first sight knew them and they knew him; whereby was I certified that the children were indeed his children and that she was his wife and I learned that the man's story was true and he was not to blame, but that the reproach and the infamy rested with my sister. Now I feared the rending of our honour-veil before the folk of our Isles; so when this wanton, this traitress, came in to me, I was incensed against her and cast her into prison and bastinado'd her grievously and hanged her up by the hair. Behold, I have acquainted thee with her case and it is thine to command, and whatso thou orderest us that we will do. Thou knowest that in this affair is dishonour and disgrace to our name and to thine, and haply the islanders will hear of it, and we shall become amongst them a byword; wherefore it befitteth thou return us an answer with all speed."" Then she delivered the letter to a courier and he carried it to the King, who, when he read it, was wroth with exceeding wrath with his daughter Manar al-Sana and wrote to Nur al-Huda, saying, ""I commit her case to thee and give thee command over her life; so, if the matter be as thou sayest, kill her without consulting me."" When the Queen had received and read her father's letter, she sent for Manar al-Sana and they set before her the prisoner drowned in her blood and pinioned with her hair, shackled with heavy iron shackles and clad in hair-cloth; and they made her stand in the presence abject and abashed. When she saw herself in this condition of passing humiliation and exceeding abjection, she called to mind her former high estate and wept with sore weeping and recited these two couplets,
""O Lord my foes are fain to slay me in despight * Nor deem I
       &nbsp     anywise to find escape by flight:
I have recourse to Thee t' annul what they have done; * Thou art
       &nbsp     th' asylum, Lord, of fearful suppliant wight.""
Then wept she grievously, till she fell down in a swoon, and presently coming to herself, repeated these two couplets,
""Troubles familiar with my heart are grown and I with them, *
       &nbsp     Erst shunning; for the generous are sociable still.
Not one mere kind alone of woe doth lieger with me lie; * Praised
       &nbsp     be God! There are with me thousands of kinds of ill.""
And also these,
""Oft times Mischance shall straiten noble breast * With grief,
       &nbsp     whence issue is for Him to shape:
But when the meshes straitest, tightest, seem * They loose,
       &nbsp     though deemed I ne'er to find escape.""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Twentieth Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Queen Nur al-Huda ordered into the presence her sister Princess Manar al-Sana, they set her between her hands and she, pinioned as she was recited the verses aforesaid. Then the Queen sent for a ladder of wood and made the eunuchs lay her on her back, with her arms spread out and bind her with cords thereto; after which she bared her head and wound her hair about the ladder-rungs and indeed all pity for her was rooted out from her heart. When Manar al-Sana saw herself in this state of abjection and humiliation, she cried out and wept; but none succoured her. Then said she to the Queen, ""O my sister, how is thy heart hardened against me? Hast thou no mercy on me nor pity on these little children?"" But her words only hardened her sister's heart and she insulted her, saying, ""O Wanton! O harlot! Allah have no ruth on whoso sueth for thee! How should I have compassion on thee, O traitress?"" Replied Manar al-Sana who lay stretched on the ladder, ""I appeal from thee to the Lord of the Heavens, concerning that wherewith thou revilest me and whereof I am innocent! By Allah, I have done no whoredom, but am lawfully married to him, and my Lord knoweth an I speak sooth or not! Indeed, my heart is wroth with thee, by reason of thine excessive hardheartedness against me! How canst thou cast at me the charge of harlotry, without knowledge? But my Lord will deliver me from thee and if that whoredom whereof thou accusest me be true, may He presently punish me for it!"" Quoth Nur al-Huda after a few moments of reflection ""How durst thou bespeak me thus?"" and rose and beat her till she fainted away; whereupon they sprinkled water on her face till she revived; and in truth her charms were wasted for excess of beating and the straitness of her bonds and the sore insults she had suffered. Then she recited these two couplets,
""If aught I've sinned in sinful way, * Or done ill deed and gone
astray,
The past repent I and I come * To you and for your pardon pray!""
When Nur al-Huda heard these lines, her wrath redoubled and she said to her, ""Wilt speak before me in verse, O whore, and seek to excuse thyself for the mortal sins thou hast sinned? 'Twas my desire that thou shouldst return to thy husband, that I might witness thy wickedness and matchless brazenfacedness; for thou gloriest in thy lewdness and wantonness and mortal heinousness."" Then she called for a palm-stick and, whenas they brought the Jaríd, she arose and baring arms to elbows, beat her sister from head to foot; after which she called for a whip of plaited thongs, wherewith if one smote an elephant, he would start off at full speed, and came down therewith on her back and her stomach and every part of her body, till she fainted. When the old woman Shawahi saw this, she fled forth from the Queen's presence, weeping and cursing her; but Nur al-Huda cried out to her eunuchs, saying, ""Fetch her to me!"" So they ran after her and seizing her, brought her back to the Queen, who bade throw her on the ground and making them lay hold of her, rose and took the whip, with which she beat her, till she swooned away, when she said to her waiting-women, ""Drag this ill-omened beldam forth on her face and put her out."" And they did as she bade them. So far concerning them; but as regards Hasan, he walked on beside the river, in the direction of the desert, distracted, troubled, and despairing of life; and indeed he was dazed and knew not night from day for stress of affliction. He ceased not faring on thus, till he came to a tree whereto he saw a scroll hanging: so he took it and found written thereon these couplets,
""When in thy mother's womb thou wast, * I cast thy case the
       &nbsp   bestest best;
And turned her heart to thee, so she * Fosterèd thee on fondest
       &nbsp    breast.
We will suffice thee in whate'er * Shall cause thee trouble or
       &nbsp   unrest;
We'll aid thee in thine enterprise * So rise and bow to our
       &nbsp  behest.""
When he had ended reading this scroll, he made sure of deliverance from trouble and of winning reunion with those he loved. Then he walked forward a few steps and found himself alone in a wild and perilous wold wherein there was none to company with him; upon which his heart sank within him for horror and loneliness and his side-muscles trembled, for that fearsome place, and he recited these couplets,
""O Zephyr of Morn, an thou pass where the dear ones dwell, * Bear
       &nbsp   greeting of lover who ever in love-longing wones!
And tell them I'm pledged to yearning and pawned to pine * And
       &nbsp    the might of my passion all passion of lovers unthrones.
Their sympathies haply shall breathe in a Breeze like thee * And
       &nbsp    quicken forthright this framework of rotting bones.""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-first Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan read the scroll he was certified of deliverance from his trouble and made sure of winning reunion with those he loved. Then he walked forward a couple of steps and stopped finding himself alone in a wild and perilous wold wherein was none to company with him, so he wept sore and recited the verses before mentioned. Then he walked on a few steps farther beside the river, till he came upon two little boys of the sons of the sorcerers, before whom lay a rod of copper graven with talismans, and beside it a skull-cap of leather, made of three gores and wroughten in steel with names and characts. The cap and rod were upon the ground and the boys were disputing and beating each other, till the blood ran down between them; whilst each cried, ""None shall take the wand but I."" So Hasan interposed and parted them, saying, ""What is the cause of your contention?"" and they replied, ""O uncle, be thou judge of our case, for Allah the Most High hath surely sent thee to do justice between us."" Quoth Hasan, ""Tell me your case, and I will judge between you;"" and quoth one of them, ""We twain are brothers-german and our sire was a mighty magician, who dwelt in a cave on yonder mountain. He died and left us this cap and rod; and my brother saith, 'None shall have the rod but I,' whilst I say the like; so be thou judge between us and deliver us each from other."" Hasan asked, ""What is the difference between the rod and the cap and what is their value? The rod appears to be worth six coppers and the cap three;"" whereto they answered, ""Thou knowest not their properties."" ""And what are their properties?"" ""Each of them hath a wonderful secret virtue, wherefore the rod is worth the revenue of all the Islands of Wak and their provinces and dependencies, and the cap the like!"" ""By Allah, O my sons, discover to me their secret virtues."" So they said, ""O uncle, they are extraordinary; for our father wrought an hundred and thirty and five years at their contrivance, till he brought them to perfection and ingrafted them with secret attributes which might serve him extraordinary services and engraved them after the likeness of the revolving sphere, and by their aid he dissolved all spells; and when he had made an end of their fashion, Death, which all needs must suffer, overtook him. Now the hidden virtue of the cap is, that whoso setteth it on his head is concealed from all folks' eyes, nor can any see him, whilst it remaineth on his head; and that of the rod is that whoso owneth it hath authority over seven tribes of the Jinn, who all serve the order and ordinance of the rod; and whenever he who possesseth it smiteth therewith on the ground, their Kings come to do him homage, and all the Jinn are at his service."" Now when Hasan heard these words, he bowed his head groundwards awhile, then said in himself, ""By Allah, I shall conquer every foe by means of this rod and cap, Inshallah! and I am worthier of them both than these two boys. So I will go about forthright to get them from the twain by craft, that I may use them to free myself and my wife and children from yonder tyrannical Queen, and then we will depart from this dismal stead, whence there is no deliverance for mortal man nor flight. Doubtless, Allah caused me not to fall in with these two lads, but that I might get the rod and cap from them."" Then he raised his head and said to the two boys, ""If ye would have me decide the case, I will make trial of you and see what each of you deserveth. He who overcometh his brother shall have the rod and he who faileth shall have the cap."" They replied,""'O uncle, we depute thee to make trial of us and do thou decide between us as thou deems fit."" Hasan asked, ""Will ye hearken to me and have regard to my words?""; and they answered, ""Yes."" Then said he, ""I will take a stone and throw it and he who outrunneth his brother thereto and picketh it up shall take the rod, and the other who is outraced shall take the cap."" And they said, ""We accept and consent to this thy proposal."" Then Hasan took a stone and threw it with his might, so that it disappeared from sight. The two boys ran under and after it and when they were at a distance, he donned the cap and hending the rod in hand, removed from his place that he might prove the truth of that which the boys had said, with regard to their scant properties. The younger outran the elder and coming first to the stone, took it and returned with it to the place where they had left Hasan, but found no signs of him. So he called to his brother, saying, ""Where is the man who was to be umpire between us?"" Quoth the other, ""I espy him not neither wot I whether he hath flown up to heaven above or sunk into earth beneath."" Then they sought for him, but saw him not, though all the while he was standing in his stead hard by them. So they abused each other, saying, ""Rod and Cap are both gone; they are neither mine nor thine: and indeed our father warned us of this very thing; but we forgot whatso he said."" Then they retraced their steps and Hasan also entered the city, wearing the cap and bearing the rod; and none saw him. Now when he was thus certified of the truth of their speech, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and making the palace, went up into the lodging of Shawahi, who saw him not, because of the cap. Then he walked up to a shelf over her head upon which were vessels of glass and chinaware, and shook it with his hand, so that what was thereon fell to the ground. The old woman cried out and beat her face; then she rose and restored the fallen things to their places, saying in herself, ""By Allah, methinks Queen Nur al-Huda hath sent a Satan to torment me, and he hath tricked me this trick! I beg Allah Almighty, deliver me from her and preserve me from her wrath, for, O Lord, if she deal thus abominably with her half-sister, beating and hanging her, dear as she is to her sire, how will she do with a stranger like myself, against whom she is incensed?""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-second Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the ancient Lady of Calamities cried, ""When Queen Nur al-Huda doeth such misdeed to her sister, what will she do to a stranger like myself, against whom she is incensed?"" Then said she, ""I conjure thee, O devil, by the Most Compassionate, the Bountiful-great, the High of Estate, of Dominion Elate who man and Jinn did create, and by the writing upon the seal of Solomon David-son (on both be the Peace!) speak to me and answer me;"" Quoth Hasan, ""I am no devil; I am Hasan, the afflicted, the distraught."" Then he raised the cap from his head and appeared to the old woman, who knew him and taking him apart, said to him, ""What is come to thy reason, that thou returnest hither? Go hide thee; for, if this wicked woman have tormented thy wife with such torments, and she her sister, what will she do, an she light on thee?"" Then she told him all that had befallen his spouse and that wherein she was of travail and torment and tribulation, and straitly described all the pains she endured adding, ""And indeed the Queen repenteth her of having let thee go and hath sent one after thee, promising him an hundred-weight of gold and my rank in her service; and she hath sworn that, if he bring thee back, she will do thee and thy wife and children dead."" And she shed tears and discovered to Hasan what the Queen had done with herself, whereat he wept and said, ""O my lady, how shall I do to escape from this land and deliver myself and my wife and children from this tyrannical Queen and how devise to return with them in safety to my own country?"" Replied the old woman, ""Woe to thee! Save thyself."" Quoth he, ""There is no help but I deliver her and my children from the Queen perforce and in her despite;"" and quoth Shawahi, ""How canst thou forcibly rescue them from her? Go and hide thyself, O my son, till Allah Almighty empower thee."" Then Hasan showed her the rod and the cap, whereat she rejoiced with joy exceeding and cried, ""Glory be to Him who quickeneth the bones, though they be rotten! By Allah, O my son, thou and thy wife were but of lost folk; now, however, thou art saved, thou and thy wife and children! For I know the rod and I know its maker, who was my Shaykh in the science of Gramarye. He was a mighty magician and spent an hundred and thirty and five years working at this rod and cap, till he brought them to perfection, when Death the Inevitable overtook him. And I have heard him say to his two boys, 'O my sons, these two things are not of your lot, for there will come a stranger from a far country, who will take them from you by force, and ye shall not know how he taketh them.' Said they, 'O our father, tell us how he will avail to take them.' But he answered, 'I wot not.' And O my son,"" added she, ""how availedst thou to take them?"" So he told her how he had taken them from the two boys, whereat she rejoiced and said, ""O my son, since thou hast gotten the whereby to free thy wife and children, give ear to what I shall say to thee. For me there is no woning with this wicked woman, after the foul fashion in which she durst use me; so I am minded to depart from her to the caves of the Magicians and there abide with them until I die. But do thou, O my son, don the cap and hend the rod in hand and enter the place where thy wife and children are. Unbind her bonds and smite the earth with the rod saying, 'Be ye present, O servants of these names!' whereupon the servants of the rod will appear; and if there present himself one of the Chiefs of the Tribes, command him whatso thou shalt wish and will."" So he farewelled her and went forth, donning the cap and hending the rod, and entered the place where his wife was. He found her well-nigh lifeless, bound to the ladder by her hair, tearful-eyed and woeful-hearted, in the sorriest of plights, knowing no way to deliver herself. Her children were playing under the ladder, whilst she looked at them and wept for them and herself, because of the barbarities and sore treatings and bitter penalties which had befallen her; and he heard her repeat these couplets,
""There remained not aught save a fluttering, breath and an eye
       &nbsp    whose owner is confounded.
And a desirous lover whose bowels are burned with fire
       &nbsp     notwithstanding which she is silent.
The exulting foe pitieth her at the sight of her. Alas for her
       &nbsp     whom the exulting foe pitieth!""
When Hasan saw her in this state of torment and misery and ignominy and infamy, he wept till he fainted; and when he recovered he saw his children playing and their mother aswoon for excess of pain; so he took the cap from his head and the children saw him and cried out, ""O our father!"" Then he covered his head again and the Princess came to herself, hearing their cry, but saw only her children weeping and shrieking, ""O our father!"" When she heard them name their sire and weep, her heart was broken and her vitals rent asunder and she said to them, ""What maketh you in mind of your father at this time?"" And she wept sore and cried out, from a bursten liver and an aching bosom, ""Where are ye and where is your father?"" Then she recalled the days of her union with Hasan and what had befallen her since her desertion of him and wept with sore weeping till her cheeks were seared and furrowed and her face was drowned in a briny flood. Her tears ran down and wetted the ground and she had not a hand loose to wipe them from her cheeks, whilst the flies fed their fill on her skin, and she found no helper but weeping and no solace but improvising verses. Then she repeated these couplets,
""I call to mind the parting-day that rent our loves in twain,
       &nbsp     When, as I turned away, the tears in very streams did rain.
The cameleer urged on his beasts with them, what while I found
       &nbsp    Nor strength nor fortitude, nor did my heart with me remain.
Yea, back I turned, unknowing of the road nor might shake off The
       &nbsp    trance of grief and longing love that numbed my heart and
       &nbsp    brain;
And worst of all betided me, on my return, was one Who came to
       &nbsp    me, in lowly guise, to glory in my pain.
Since the belovèd's gone, O soul, forswear the sweet of life Nor
       &nbsp     covet its continuance, for, wanting him, 'twere vain.
List, O my friend, unto the tale of love, and God forbid That I
       &nbsp     should speak and that thy heart to hearken should not deign!
As 'twere El Asmaï himself, of passion I discourse Fancies rare
       &nbsp     and marvellous, linked in an endless chain.""
—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-third Night,
She continued, When Hasan went in to his wife he saw his children and heard her repeating the verses afore mentioned. Then she turned right and left, seeking the cause of her children's crying out, ""O our father!"" but saw no one and marvelled that her sons should name their sire at that time and call upon him. But when Hasan heard her verses, he wept till he swooned away and the tears railed down his cheeks like rain. Then he drew near the children and raised the cap from his head unseen of his wife, whereupon they saw him and they knew him and cried out, saying, ""O our father!"" Their mother fell a-weeping again, when she heard them name their sire's name and said, ""There is no avoiding the doom which Almighty Allah hath decreed!"" adding, ""O Strange! What garreth them think of their father at this time and call upon him, albeit it is not of their wont?"" Then she wept and recited these couplets,
""The land of lamping moon is bare and drear; * O eyne of me pour
       &nbsp   forth the brimming tear!
They marched: how shall I now be patient? * That I nor heart nor
       &nbsp   patience own I swear!
O ye, who marched yet bide in heart of me, * Will you, O lords of
       &nbsp    me, return to that we were?
What harm if they return and I enjoy * Meeting, and they had ruth
       &nbsp    on tears of care?
Upon the parting-day they dimmed these eyne, * For sad surprise,
       &nbsp    and lit the flames that flare.
Sore longed I for their stay, but Fortune stayed * Longings and
       &nbsp    turned my hope to mere despair.
Return to us (O love!) by Allah, deign! * Enow of tears have
       &nbsp    flowed for absence-bane.""
Then Hasan could no longer contain himself, but took the cap from his head; whereupon his wife saw him and recognising him screamed a scream which startled all in the palace, and said to him, ""How camest thou hither? From the sky hast thou dropped or through the earth hast thou come up?"" And her eyes brimmed with tears and Hasan also wept. Quoth she, ""O man, this be no time for tears or blame. Fate hath had its course and the sight was blinded and the Pen hath run with what was ordained of Allah when Time was begun: so, Allah upon thee, whencesoever thou comest, go hide, lest any espy thee and tell my sister and she do thee and me die!"" Answered he, ""O my lady and lady of all Queens, I have adventured myself and come hither, and either I will die or I will deliver thee from this strait and travel with thee and my children to my country, despite the nose of this thy wickedest sister."" But as she heard his words she smiled and for awhile fell to shaking her head and said, ""Far, O my fife, far is it from the power of any except Allah Almighty to deliver me from this my strait! Save thyself by flight and wend thy ways and cast not thyself into destruction; for she hath conquering hosts none may withstand. Given that thou tookest me and wentest forth, how canst thou make thy country and escape from these islands and the perils of these awesome places? Verily, thou hast seen on thy way hither, the wonders, the marvels, the dangers and the terrors of the road, such as none may escape, not even one of the rebel Jinns. Depart, therefore, forthright and add not cark to my cark and care to my care, neither do thou pretend to rescue me from this my plight; for who shall carry me to thy country through all these vales and thirsty wolds and fatal steads?"" Rejoined Hasan, ""By thy life, O light of mine eyes, I will not depart this place nor fare but with thee!"" Quoth she, ""O man! How canst thou avail unto this thing and what manner of man art thou? Thou knowest not what thou sayest! None can escape from these realms, even had he command over Jinns, Ifrits, magicians, chiefs of tribes and Marids. Save thyself and leave me; perchance Allah will bring about good after ill."" Answered Hasan, ""O lady of fair ones, I came not save to deliver thee with this rod and with this cap."" And he told her what had befallen him with the two boys; but, whilst he was speaking, behold, up came the Queen and heard their speech. Now when he was ware of her, he donned the cap and was hidden from sight, and she entered and said to the Princess, ""O wanton, who is he with whom thou wast talking?"" Answered Manar al-Sanar, ""Who is with me that should talk with me, except these children?"" Then the Quee took the whip and beat her, whilst Hasan stood by and looked on, nor did she leave beating her till she fainted; whereupon she bade transport her to another place. So they loosed her and carried her to another chamber whilst Hasan followed unseen. There they cast her down, senseless, and stood gazing upon her, till she revived and recited these couplets,
""I have sorrowed on account of our disunion with a sorrow that
       &nbsp    made the tears to overflow from my eyelids;
And I vowed that if Fortune reunite us, I would never again
       &nbsp  mention our separation;
And I would say to the envious, Die ye with regret; By Allah I
       &nbsp    have now attained my desire!
Joy hath overwhelmed me to such a degree that by its excess it
       &nbsp    hath made me weep.
O eye, how hath weeping become thy habit? Thou weepest in joy as
       &nbsp   well, as in sorrows.""
When she ceased her verse the slave-girls went out from her and Hasan took off the cap; whereupon his wife said to him, ""See, O man, all this befel me not save by reason of my having rebelled against thee and transgressed thy commandment and gone forth without thy leave. So, Allah upon thee blame me not for my sins and know that women never wot a man's worth till they have lost him. Indeed, I have offended and done evil; but I crave pardon of Allah Almighty for whatso I did, and if He reunite us, I will never again gainsay thee in aught, no, never!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-fourth Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan's wife besought pardon of him saying, ""Blame me not for my sin; and indeed I crave mercy of Allah Almighty."" Quoth Hasan (and indeed his heart ached for her), ""'Twas not thou that wast in fault; nay, the fault was mine and mine only, for I fared forth and left thee with one who knew not thy rank, neither thy worth nor thy degree. But know, O beloved of my heart and fruit of my vitals and light of mine eyes, that Allah (blessed be He!) hath ordained to me power of releasing thee; so, say me, wouldst thou have me carry thee to thy father's home, there to accomplish what Allah decreeth unto thee, or wilt thou forthright depart with me to mine own country, now that relief is come to thee?"" Quoth she, ""Who can deliver me save the Lord of the Heavens? Go to thy motherland and put away from thee false hope; for thou knowest not the perils of these parts which, an thou obey me not, soon shalt thou sight."" And she improvised these couplets,
""On me and with me bides thy volunty; * Why then such anger such
       &nbsp   despite to me?
Whate'er befel us Heaven forbid that love * Fade for long time or
       &nbsp  e'er forgotten be!
Ceased not the spy to haunt our sides, till seen * Our love
       &nbsp estranged and then estranged was he:
In truth I trusted to fair thoughts of thine * Though spake the
       &nbsp    wicked spy maliciously.
We'll keep the secret 'twixt us twain and bold * Although the
       &nbsp    brand of blame unsheathed we see.
The livelong day in longing love I spend * Hoping acceptance-
       &nbsp   message from my friend.""
Then wept she and her children, and the handmaidens heard them: so they came in to them and found them weeping, but saw not Hasan with them; wherefore they wept for ruth of them and damned Queen Nur al-Huda. Then Hasan took patience till night came on and her guards had gone to their sleeping-places, when he arose and girded his waist; then went up to her and, loosing her, kissed her on the head and between the eyes and pressed her to his bosom, saying, ""How long have we wearied for our mother-land and for reunion there! Is this our meeting in sleep, or on wake?"" Then he took up the elder boy and she took up the younger and they went forth the palace; and Allah veiled them with the veil of His protection, so that they came safe to the outer gate which closed the entrance to the Queen's Serraglio. But finding it locked from without, Hasan said, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily we are Allah's and unto Him shall we return!"" With this they despaired of escape and Hasan beat hand upon hand, saying, ""O Dispeller of dolours! Indeed, I had bethought me of every thing and considered its conclusion but this; and now, when it is daybreak, they will take us, and what device have we in this case?"" And he recited the following two couplets,
""Thou madest fair thy thought of Fate, whenas the days were fair,
       &nbsp  And fearedst not the unknown ills that they to thee might
       &nbsp bring.
The nights were fair and calm to thee; thou wast deceived by
       &nbsp  them, For in the peace of night is born full many a
       &nbsp  troublous thing.""
Then Hasan wept and his wife wept for his weeping and for the abasement she had suffered and the cruelties of Time and Fortune,
""Baulks me my Fate as tho' she were my foe; * Each day she
       &nbsp    showeth me new cark and care:
Fate, when I aim at good, brings clear reverse, * And lets foul
       &nbsp    morrow wait on day that's fair.""
And also these,
""Irks me my Fate and clean unknows that I * Of my high worth her
       &nbsp     shifts and shafts despise.
She nights parading what ill-will she works: * I night parading
       &nbsp     Patience to her eyes.""
Then his wife said to him, ""By Allah, there is no relief for us but to kill ourselves and be at rest from this great and weary travail; else we shall suffer grievous torment on the morrow."" At this moment, behold, they heard a voice from without the door say, ""By Allah, O my lady Manar al-Sana, I will not open to thee and thy husband Hasan, except ye obey me in whatso I shall say to you!"" When they heard these words they were silent for excess of fright and would have returned whence they came; when lo! the voice spake again saying, ""What aileth you both to be silent and answer me not?"" Therewith they knew the speaker for the old woman Shawahi, Lady of Calamities, and said to her, ""Whatsoever thou biddest us, that will we do; but first open the door to us; this being no time for talk."" Replied she, ""By Allah, I will not open to you until ye both swear to me that you will take me with you and not leave me with yonder whore: so, whatever befalleth you shall befal me and if ye escape, I shall escape, and if ye perish, I shall perish: for yonder abominable woman, tribade that she is! entreateth me with indignity and still tormenteth me on your account; and thou, O my daughter, knowest my worth."" Now recognising her they trusted in her and sware to her an oath such as contented her, whereupon she opened the door to them and they fared forth and found her riding on a Greek jar of red earthenware with a rope of palm-fibres about its neck, which rolled under her and ran faster than a Najdi colt, and she came up to them, and said, ""Follow me and fear naught, for I know forty modes of magic by the least of which I could make this city a dashing sea, swollen with clashing billows, and ensorcel each damsel therein to a fish, and all before dawn. But I was not able to work aught of my mischief, for fear of the King her father and of regard to her sisters, for that they are formidable, by reason of their many guards and tribesmen and servants. However, soon will I show you wonders of my skill in witchcraft; and now let us on, relying upon the blessing of Allah and His good aid."" Now Hasan and his wife rejoiced in this, making sure of escape, —And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-fifth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan and his wife, accompanied by the ancient dame Shawahi, fared forth from the palace, they made sure of deliverance and they walked on till they came without the city, when he fortified his heart and, smiting the earth with the rod, cried, ""Ho, ye servants of these names, appear to me and acquaint me with your conditions!"" Thereupon the earth clave asunder and out came ten Ifrits, with their feet in the bowels of the earth and their heads in the clouds. They kissed the earth three times before Hasan and said as with one voice, ""Adsumus! Here are we at thy service, O our lord and ruler over us! What dost thou bid us do? For we hear and obey thy commandment. An thou wilt, we will dry thee up seas and remove mountains from their places."" So Hasan rejoiced in their words and at their speedy answer to his evocation then taking courage and bracing up his resolution, he said to them, ""Who are ye and what be your names and your races, and to what tribes and clans and companies appertain ye?"" They kissed the earth once more and answered as with one voice, saying, ""We are seven Kings, each ruling over seven tribes of the Jinn of all conditions, and Satans and Marids, flyers and divers, dwellers in mountains and wastes and wolds and haunters of the seas: so bid us do whatso thou wilt; for we are thy servants and thy slaves, and whoso possesseth this rod hath dominion over an our necks and we owe him obedience."" Now when Hasan heard this, he rejoiced with joy exceeding, as did his wife and the old woman, and presently he said to the Kings of the Jinn, ""I desire of you that ye show me your tribes and hosts and guards."" ""O our lord,"" answered they, ""if we show thee our tribes, we fear for thee and these who are with thee, for their name is legion and they are various in form and fashion, figure and favour. Some of us are heads sans bodies and others bodies sans heads, and others again are in the likeness of wild beasts and ravening lions. However, if this be thy will, there is no help but we first show thee those of us who are like unto wild beasts. But, O our lord, what wouldst thou of us at this present?"" Quoth Hasan, ""I would have you carry me forthwith to the city of Baghdad, me and my wife and this honest woman."" But, hearing his words they hung down their heads and were silent, whereupon Hasan asked them, ""Why do ye not reply?"" And they answered as with one voice, ""O our lord and ruler over us, we are of the covenant of Solomon son of David (on the twain be Peace!) and he sware us in that we would bear none of the sons of Adam on our backs; since which time we have borne no mortal on back or shoulder: but we will straightway harness thee horses of the Jinn, that shall carry thee and thy company to thy country."" Hasan enquired, ""How far are we from Baghdad?"" and they, ""Seven years' journey for a diligent horseman."" Hasan marvelled at this and said to them, ""Then how came I hither in less than a year?""; and they said, ""Allah softened to thee the hearts of His pious servants else hadst thou never come to this country nor hadst thou set eyes on these regions; no, never! For the Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus, who mounted thee on the elephant and the magical horse, traversed with thee, in ten days, three years' journey for a well-girt rider, and the Ifrit Dahnash, to whom the Shaykh committed thee, carried thee a three years' march in a day and a night; all which was of the blessing of Allah Almighty, for that the Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh is of the seed of Asaf bin Barkhiyá and knoweth the Most Great name of Allah. Moreover, from Baghdad to the palace of the damsels is a year's journey, and this maketh up the seven years."" When Hasan heard this, he marvelled with exceeding marvel and cried, ""Glory be to God, Facilitator of the hard, Fortifier of the weak heart, Approximator of the far and Humbler of every froward tyrant, Who hath eased us of every accident and carried me to these countries and subjected to me these creatures and reunited me with my wife and children! I know not whether I am asleep or awake or if I be sober or drunken!"" Then he turned to the Jinn and asked, ""When ye have mounted me upon your steeds, in how many days will they bring us to Baghdad?""; and they answered, ""They will carry you thither under the year, but not till after ye have endured terrible perils and hardships and horrors and ye have traversed thirsty Wadys and frightful wastes and horrible steads without number; and we cannot promise thee safety, O our lord, from the people of these islands,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-sixth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Jann said to Hasan, ""We cannot promise thee safety, O our lord, from this Islandry, nor from the mischief of the Supreme King and his enchanters and warlocks. It may be they will overcome us and take you from us and we fall into affliction with them, and all to whom the tidings shall come after this will say to us: 'Ye are wrong-doers! How could ye go against the Supreme King and carry a mortal out of his dominions, and eke the King's daughter with him?' adding, 'Wert thou alone with us the thing were light; but He who conveyed thee hither is capable to carry thee back to thy country and reunite thee with thine own people forthright and in readiest plight. So take heart and put thy trust in Allah and fear not; for we are at thy service, to convey thee to thy country."" Hasan thanked them therefor and said, ""Allah requite you with good! but now make haste with the horses;"" they replied, ""We hear and we obey,"" and struck the ground with their feet, whereupon it opened and they disappeared within it and were absent awhile, after which they suddenly reappeared with three horses, saddled and bridled, and on each saddle-bow a pair of saddle-bags, with a leathern bottle of water in one pocket and the other full of provaunt. So Hasan mounted one steed and took a child before him, whilst his wife mounted a second and took the other child before her. Then the old woman alighted from the jar and bestrode the third horse and they rode on, without ceasing, all night. At break of day, they turned aside from the road and made for the mountain, whilst their tongues ceased not to name Allah. Then they fared on under the highland all that day, till Hasan caught sight of a black object afar as it were a tall column of smoke a-twisting skywards; so he recited somewhat of the Koran and Holy Writ, and sought refuge with Allah from Satan the Stoned. The black thing grew plainer as they drew near, and when hard by it, they saw that it was an Ifrit, with a head like a huge dome and tusks like grapnels and jaws like a lane and nostrils like ewers and ears like leathern targes and mouth like a cave and teeth like pillars of stone and hands like winnowing forks and legs like masts: his head was in the cloud and his feet in the bowels of the earth had plowed. Whenas Hasan gazed upon him he bowed himself and kissed the ground before him, saying, ""O Hasan, have no fear of me; for I am the chief of the dwellers in this land, which is the first of the Isles of Wak, and I am a Moslem and an adorer of the One God. I have heard of you and your coming and when I knew of your case, I desired to depart from the land of the magicians to another land, void of inhabitants and far from men and Jinn, that I might dwell there alone and worship Allah till my fated end came upon me. So I wish to accompany you and be your guide, till ye fare forth of the Wak Islands; and I will not appear save at night; and do ye hearten your hearts on my account; for I am a Moslem, even as ye are Moslems."" When Hasan heard the Ifrit's words, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and made sure of deliverance; and he said to him, ""Allah requite thee weal! Go with us relying upon the blessing of Allah!"" So the Ifrit forewent them and they followed, talking and making merry, for their hearts were pleased and their breasts were eased and Hasan fell to telling his wife all that had befallen him and all the hardships he had undergone, whilst she excused herself to him and told him, in turn, all she had seen and suffered. They ceased not faring all that night.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-seventh Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they ceased not faring all that night and the horses bore them like the blinding leven, and when the day rose all put their hands to the saddle-bags and took forth provaunt which they ate and water which they drank. Then they sped diligently on their way, preceded by the Ifrit, who turned aside with them from the beaten track into another road, till then untrodden, along the seashores and they ceased not faring on, without stopping, across Wadys and wolds a whole month, till on the thirty-first day there arose before them a dust-cloud, that walled the world and darkened the day; and when Hasan saw this, he was confused and turned pale; and more so when a frightful crying and clamour struck their ears. There, upon the old woman said to him, ""O my son, this is the army of the Wak Islands, that hath overtaken us; and presently they will lay violent hands on us."" Hasan asked, ""What shall I do, O my mother?""; and she answered, ""Strike the earth with the rod."" He did so whereupon the Seven Kings presented themselves and saluted him with the salam, kissing ground before him and saying, ""Fear not neither grieve."" Hasan rejoiced at these words and answered them, saying, ""Well said, O Princes of the Jinn and the Ifrits! This is your time!"" Quoth they, ""Get ye up to the mountain-top, thou and thy wife and children and she who is with thee and leave us to deal with them, for we know that you all are in the right and they in the wrong and Allah will aid us against them."" So Hasan and his wife and children and the old woman dismounted and dismissing the horses, ascended the flank of the mountain.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-eighth Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan with his wife, his children and the ancient dame ascended the mountain-flank after they had dismissed the coursers. Presently, up came Queen Nur al-Huda, with the troops right and left, and the captains went round about among the host and ranged them rank by rank in battle array. Then the hosts charged down upon each other and clashed together the twain with a mighty strain, the brave pressed on amain and the coward to fly was fain and the Jinn cast flames of fire from their mouths, whilst the smoke of them rose up to the confines of the sky and the two armies appeared and disappeared. The champions fought and heads flew from trunks and the blood ran in rills; nor did brand leave to play and blood to flow and battle fire to flow, till the murk o' night came, when the two hosts drew apart and, alighting from their steeds rested upon the field by the fires they had kindled. Therewith the Seven Kings went up to Hasan and kissed the earth before him. He pressed forwards to meet them and thanked them and prayed Allah to give them the victory and asked them how they had fared with the Queen's troops. Quoth they, ""They will not withstand us more than three days, for we had the better of them to-day, taking some two thousand of them prisoners and slaying of them much folk whose compt may not be told. So be of good cheer and broad of breast."" Then they farewelled him and went down to look after the safety of their troops; and they ceased not to keep up the fires till the morning rose with its sheen and shone, when the fighting-men mounted their horses of noble strain and smote one another with thin-edged skean and with brawn of bill they thrust amain nor did they cease that day battle to darraign. Moreover, they passed the night on horseback clashing together like dashing seas; raged among them the fires of war and they stinted not from battle and jar, till the armies of Wak were defeated and their power broken and their courage quelled; their feet slipped and whither they fled soever defeat was before them; wherefore they turned tail and of flight began to avail: but the most part of them were slain and their Queen and her chief officers and the grandees of her realm were captive ta'en. When the morning morrowed, the Seven Kings presented themselves before Hasan and set for him a throne of alabaster inlaid with pearls and jewels, and he sat down thereon. They also set thereby a throne of ivory, plated with glittering gold, for the Princess Manar al-Sana and another for the ancient dame Shawahi Zat al-Dawahi. Then they brought before them the prisoners and among the rest, Queen Nur al-Huda with elbows pinioned and feet fettered, whom when Shawahi saw, she said to her, ""Thy recompense, O harlot, O tyrant, shall be that two bitches be starved and two mares stinted of water, till they be athirst: then shalt thou be bound to the mares' tails and these driven to the river, with the bitches following thee that they may rend thy skin; and after, thy flesh shall be cut off and given them to eat. How couldst thou do with thy sister such deed, O strumpet, seeing that she was lawfully married, after the ordinance of Allah and of His Apostle? For there is no monkery in Al-Islam and marriage is one of the institutions of the Apostles (on whom be the Peace!) nor were women created but for men."" Then Hasan commanded to put all the captives to the sword and the old woman cried out, saying, ""Slay them all and spare none!"" But, when Princess Manar al-Sana saw her sister in this plight, a bondswoman and in fetters, she wept over her and said, ""O my sister, who is this hath conquered us and made us captives in our own country?"" Quoth Nur al-Huda, ""Verily, this is a mighty matter. Indeed this man Hasan hath gotten the mastery over us and Allah hath given him dominion over us and over all our realm and he hath overcome us, us and the Kings of the Jinn."" And quoth her sister, ""Indeed, Allah aided him not against you nor did he overcome you nor capture you save by means of this cap and rod."" So Nur al-Huda was certified and assured that he had conquered her by means thereof and humbled herself to her sister, till she was moved to ruth for her and said to her husband, ""What wilt thou do with my sister? Behold, she is in thy hands and she hath done thee no misdeed that thou shouldest punish her."" Replied Hasan, ""Her torturing of thee was misdeed enow."" But she answered, saying, ""She hath excuse for all she did with me. As for thee, thou hast set my father's heart on fire for the loss of me, and what will be his case, if he lose my sister also?"" And he said to her, ""'Tis thine to decide; do whatso thou wilt."" So she bade loose her sister and the rest of the captives, and they did her bidding. Then she went up to Queen Nur al-Huda and embraced her, and they wept together a long while; after which quoth the Queen, ""O my sister, bear me not malice for that I did with thee;"" and quoth Manar al-Sana, ""O my sister, this was foreordained to me by Fate."" Then they sat on the couch talking and Manar al-Sana made peace between the old woman and her sister, after the goodliest fashion, and their hearts were set at ease. Thereupon Hasan dismissed the servants of the rod thanking them for the succour which they had afforded him against his foes, and Manar al-Sana related to her sister all that had befallen her with Hasan her husband and every thing he had suffered for her sake, saying, ""O my sister, since he hath done these deeds and is possessed of this might and Allah Almighty hath gifted him with such exceeding prowess, that he hath entered our country and beaten thine army and taken thee prisoner and defied our father, the Supreme King, who hath dominion over all the Princes of the Jinn, it behoveth us to fail not of what is due to him."" Replied Nur al-Huda, ""By Allah, O my sister, thou sayest sooth in whatso thou tellest me of the marvels which this man hath seen and suffered; and none may fail of respect to him. But was all this on thine account, O my sister?""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Twenty-ninth Night,
She pursued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Princess Manar al-Sana repeated to her sister these praises of Hasan, the other replied, ""By Allah, this man can claim all respect more by token of his generosity. But was all this on thine account?"" ""Yes,"" answered Manar al-Sana, and they passed the night in converse till the morning morrowed and the sun rose and they were minded to depart. So they farewelled one another and Manar al-Sana gave God-speed to the ancient dame after the reconciling her with Queen Nur al-Huda. Thereupon Hasan smote the earth with the rod and its servants the Jinn appeared and saluted him, saying, ""Praised be Allah, who hath set thy soul at rest! Command us what thou wilt, and we will do it for thee in less than the twinking of an eye."" He thanked them for their saying and said to them ""Allah requite you with good! Saddle me two steeds of the best."" So they brought him forthwith two saddled coursers, one of which he mounted, taking his elder son before him, and his wife rode the other, taking the younger son in front of her. Then the Queen and the old woman also backed horse and departed, Hasan and his wife following the right and Nur al-Huda and Shawahi the left hand road. The spouses fared on with their children, without stopping, for a whole month, till they drew in sight of a city, which they found compassed about with trees and streams and, making the trees, dismounted beneath them thinking to rest there. As they sat talking, behold, they saw many horsemen coming towards them, whereupon Hasan rose and going to meet them, saw that it was King Hassun, lord of the Land of Camphor and Castle of Crystal, with his attendants. So Hasan went up to the King and kissed his hands and saluted him; and when Hassun saw him, he dismounted and seating himself with Hasan upon carpets under the trees returned his salam and gave him joy of his safety and rejoiced in him with exceeding joy, saying to him, ""O Hasan, tell me all that hath befallen thee, first and last."" So he told him all of that, whereupon the King marvelled and said to him, ""O my son, none ever reached the Islands of Wak and returned thence but thou, and indeed thy case is wondrous; but Alhamdolillah—praised be God—for safety!"" Then he mounted and bade Hasan ride with his wife and children into the city, where he lodged them in the guest-house of his palace; and they abode with him three days, eating and drinking in mirth and merriment, after which Hasan sought Hassun's leave to depart to his own country and the King granted it. Accordingly they took horse and the King rode with them ten days, after which he farewelled them and turned back, whilst Hasan and his wife and children fared on a whole month, at the end of which time they came to a great cavern, whose floor was of brass. Quoth Hasan to his wife, ""Kennest thou yonder cave?""; and quoth she, ""No."" Said he, ""Therein dwelleth a Shaykh, Abu al-Ruwaysh hight, to whom I am greatly beholden, for that he was the means of my becoming acquainted with King Hassun."" Then he went on to tell her all that had passed between him and Abu al-Ruwaysh, and as he was thus engaged, behold, the Shaykh himself issued from the cavernmouth. When Hasan saw him, he dismounted from his steed and kissed his hands, and the old man saluted him and gave him joy of his safety and rejoiced in him. Then he carried him into the antre and sat down with him, whilst Hasan related to him what had befallen him in the Islands of Wak; whereat the Elder marvelled with exceeding marvel and said, ""O Hasan, how didst thou deliver thy wife and children?"" So he told them the tale of the cap and the rod, hearing which he wondered and said, ""O Hasan, O my son, but for this rod and the cap, thou hadst never delivered thy wife and children."" And he replied, ""Even so, O my lord."" As they were talking, there came a knocking at the door and Abu al-Ruwaysh went out and found Abd al-Kaddus mounted on his elephant. So he saluted him and brought him into the cavern, where he embraced Hasan and congratulated him on his safety, rejoicing greatly in his return. Then said Abu al-Ruwaysh to Hasan, ""Tell the Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus all that hath befallen thee, O Hasan."" He repeated to him every thing that had passed, first and last, till he came to the tale of the rod and cap,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Thirtieth Night,
She resumed, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Hasan began relating to Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus and Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh (who sat chattting in the cave) all that had passed, first and last, till he came to the tale of the rod and cap; where, upon quoth Abd al-Kaddus, ""O my son, thou hast delivered thy wife and thy children and hast no further need of the two. Now we were the means of thy winning to the Islands of Wak, and I have done thee kindness for the sake of my nieces, the daughters of my brother; wherefore I beg thee, of thy bounty and favour, to give me the rod and the Shaykh Abu al-Ruwaysh the cap."" When Hasan heard this, he hung down his head, being ashamed to reply, ""I will not give them to you,"" and said in his mind, ""Indeed these two Shaykhs have done me great kindness and were the means of my winning to the Islands of Wak, and but for them I had never made the place, nor delivered my children, nor had I gotten me this rod and cap."" So he raised his head and answered, ""Yes, I will give them to you: but, O my lords, I fear lest the Supreme King, my wife's father, come upon me with his commando and combat with me in my own country, and I be unable to repel them, for want of the rod and the cap."" Replied Abd al-Kaddus, ""Fear not, O my son; we will continually succour thee and keep watch and ward for thee in this place; and whosoever shall come against thee from thy wife's father or any other, him we will fend off from thee; wherefore be thou of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool of tear, and hearten thy heart and broaden thy breast and feel naught whatsoever of fear, for no harm shall come to thee."" When Hasan heard this he was abashed and gave the cap to Abu al-Ruwaysh, saying to Abd al-Kaddus, ""Accompany me to my own country and I will give thee the rod."" At this the two elders rejoiced with exceeding joy and made him ready riches and treasures which beggar all description. He abode with them three days, at the end of which he set out again and the Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus made ready to depart with him. So he and his wife mounted their beasts and Abd al-Kaddus whistled, when, behold, a mighty big elephant trotted up with fore hand and feet on amble from the heart of the desert and he took it and mounted it. Then they farewelled Abu al-Ruwaysh who disappeared within his cavern; and they fared on across country, traversing the land in its length and breadth wherever Abd al-Kaddus guided them by a short cut and an easy way, till they drew near the land of the Princesses; whereupon Hasan rejoiced at finding himself once more near his mother, and praised Allah for his safe return and reunion with his wife and children after so many hardships and perils; and thanked Him for His favours and bounties, reciting these couplets,
""Haply shall Allah deign us twain unite * And lockt in strict
       &nbsp    embrace we'll hail the light:
And wonders that befel me I'll recount, * And all I suffered from
       &nbsp    the Severance-blight:
And fain I'll cure mine eyes by viewing you * For ever yearned my
       &nbsp     heart to see your sight:
I hid a tale for you my heart within * Which when we meet o' morn
       &nbsp    I'll fain recite:
I'll blame you for the deeds by you were done * But while blame
       &nbsp    endeth love shall stay in site.""
Hardly had he made an end of these verses, when he looked and behold, there rose to view the Green Dome and the jetting Fount and the Emerald Palace, and the Mountain of Clouds showed to them from afar; whereupon quoth Abd al-Kaddus, ""Rejoice, O Hasan, in good tidings: to-night shalt thou be the guest of my nieces!"" At this he joyed with exceeding joy and as also did his wife, and they alighted at the domed pavilion, where they took their rest and ate and drank; after which they mounted horse again and rode on till they came upon the palace. As they drew near, the Princesses who were daughters of the King, brother to Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus, came forth to meet them and saluted them and their uncle who said to them, ""O daughters of my brother, behold, I have accomplished the need of this your brother Hasan and have helped him to regain his wife and children."" So they embraced him and gave him joy of his return in safety and health and of his reunion with his wife and children, and it was a day of festival with them. Then came forward Hasan's sister, the youngest Princess, and embraced him, weeping with sore weeping, whilst he also wept for his long desolation: after which she complained to him of that which she had suffered for the pangs of separation and weariness of spirit in his absence and recited these two couplets,
""After thy faring never chanced I'spy * A shape, but did thy form
       &nbsp     therein descry:
Nor closed mine eyes in sleep but thee I saw, * E'en as though
       &nbsp     dwelling 'twixt the lid and eye.""
When she had made an end of her verses, she rejoiced with joy exceeding and Hasan said to her, ""O my sister, I thank none in this matter save thyself over all thy sisters, and may Allah Almighty vouchsafe thee aidance and countenance!"" Then he related to her all that had past in his journey, from first to last, and all that he had undergone, telling her what had betided him with his wife's sister and how he had delivered his wife and wees and he also described to her all that he had seen of marvels and grievous perils, even to how Queen Nur al-Huda would have slain him and his spouse and children and none saved them from her but the Lord the Most High. Moreover, he related to her the adventure of the cap and the rod and how Abd al-Kaddus and Abu al-Ruwaysh had asked for them and he had not agreed to give them to the twain save for her sake; wherefore she thanked him and blessed him wishing him long life; and he cried, ""By Allah, I shall never forget all the kindness thou hast done me from incept to conclusion.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eight Hundred and Thirty-first Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Hasan foregathered with the Princesses, he related to his sister all that he had endured and said to her, ""Never will I forget what thou hast done for me from incept to conclusion."" Then she turned to his wife Manar al-Sana and embraced her and pressed her children to her breast, saying to her, ""O daughter of the Supreme King, was there no pity in thy bosom, that thou partedst him and his children and settedst his heart on fire for them? Say me, didst thou desire by this deed that he should die?"" The Princess laughed and answered, ""Thus was it ordained of Allah (extolled and exalted be He!) and whoso beguileth folk, him shall Allah begule."" Then they set on somewhat of meat and drink, and they all ate and drank and made merry. They abode thus ten days in feast and festival, mirth and merry-making, at the end of which time Hasan prepared to continue his journey. So his sister rose and made him ready riches and rarities, such as defy description. Then she strained him to her bosom, because of leavetaking, and threw her arms round his neck whilst he recited on her account these couplets,
""The solace of lovers is naught but far, * And parting is naught
       &nbsp   save grief singular:
And ill-will and absence are naught but woe, * And the victims of
       &nbsp  Love naught but martyrs are;
And how tedious is night to the loving wight * From his true love
       &nbsp   parted 'neath evening star!
His tears course over his cheeks and so * He cries, 'O tears be
       &nbsp     there more to flow?'""
With this Hasan gave the rod to Shaykh Abd al-Kaddus, who joyed therein with exceeding joy and thanking him and securing it mounted and returned to his own place. Then Hasan took horse with his wife and children and departed from the Palace of the Princesses, who went forth with him, to farewell him. Then they turned back and Hasan fared on, over wild and wold, two months and ten days, till he came to the city of Baghdad, the House of Peace, and repairing to his home by the private postern which gave upon the open country, knocked at the door. Now his mother, for long absence, had forsworn sleep and given herself to mourning and weeping and wailing, till she fell sick and ate no meat, neither took delight in slumber but shed tears night and day. She ceased not to call upon her son's name albeit she despaired of his returning to her; and as he stood at the door, he heard her weeping and reciting these couplets,
""By Allah, heal, O my lords, the unwhole * Of wasted frame and
       &nbsp     heart worn with dole:
An you grant her a meeting 'tis but your grace * Shall whelm in
       &nbsp    the boons of the friend her soul:
I despair not of Union the Lord can grant * And to weal of
       &nbsp    meeting our woes control!""
When she had ended her verses, she heard her son's voice at the door, calling out, ""O mother, mother ah! fortune hath been kind and hath vouchsafed our reunion!"" Hearing his cry she knew his voice and went to the door, between belief and misbelief; but, when she opened it she saw him standing there and with him his wife and children; so she shrieked aloud, for excess of joy, and fell to the earth in a fainting-fit. Hasan ceased not soothing her, till she recovered and embraced him; then she wept with joy, and presently she called his slaves and servants and bade them carry all his baggage into the house. So they brought in every one of the loads, and his wife and children entered also, whereupon Hasan's mother went up to the Princess and kissed her head and bussed her feet, saying, ""O daughter of the Supreme King, if I have failed of thy due, behold, I crave pardon of Almighty Allah."" Then she turned to Hasan and said to him, ""O my son, what was the cause of this long strangerhood?"" He related to her all his adventures from beginning to end; and when she heard tell of all that had befallen him, she cried a great cry and fell down a-fainting at the very mention of his mishaps. He solaced her, till she came to herself and said, ""By Allah, O my son, thou hast done unwisely in parting with the rod and the cap for, hadst thou kept them with the care due to them, thou wert master of the whole earth, in its breadth and length; but praised be Allah, for thy safety, O my son, and that of thy wife and children!"" They passed the night in all pleasance and happiness, and on the morrow Hasan changed his clothes and donning a suit of the richest apparel, went down into the bazar and bought black slaves and slave-girls and the richest stuffs and ornaments and furniture such as carpets and costly vessels and all manner other precious things, whose like is not found with Kings. Moreover, he purchased houses and gardens and estates and so forth and abode with his wife and his children and his mother, eating and drinking and pleasuring: nor did they cease from all joy of life and its solace till there came to them the Destroyer of delights and the Severer of societies. And Glory be to Him who hath dominion over the Seen and the Unseen, who is the Living, the Eternal, Who dieth not at all! And men also recount the adventures of

Footnotes:

 This famous tale is a sister prose-poem to the ""Arabian
Odyssey"" Sindbad the Seaman; only the Bassorite's travels are in
Jinn-land and Japan. It has points of resemblance in
""fundamental outline"" with the Persian Romance of the Fairy Hasan
Bánú and King Bahrám-i-Gúr. See also the Kathá (s.s.) and the two
sons of the Asúra Máyá; the Tartar ""Sidhi Kúr"" (Tales of a
Vampire or Enchanted Corpse) translated by Mr. W. J. Thoms (the
Father of ""Folk-lore"" in 1846,) in ""Lays and Legends of various
Nations""; the Persian Bahár-i-Dánish (Prime of Lore). Miss
Stokes' ""Indian Fairy Tales""; Miss Frere's ""Old Deccan Days"" and
Mrs. F. A. Steel's ""Tale of the King and his Seven Sons,"" with

Panjab, Indian Antiquary of March, 1882).
 In the Mac. Edit. (vol. iv. i.) the merchant has two sons who became one a brazier (""dealer in copper-wares"" says Lane iii. 385) and the other a goldsmith. The Bresl. Edit. (v. 264) mentions only one son, Hasan, the hero of the story which is entitled, ""Tale of Hasan al-Basrí and the Isles of Wák Wák.""
 Arab. ""Shásh Abyaz:"" this distinctive sign of the True Believer was adopted by the Persian to conceal his being a fire-worshipper, Magian or ""Guebre."" The latter word was introduced from the French by Lord Byron and it is certainly far superior to Moore's ""Gheber.""
 Persians being always a suspected folk.
 Arab. ""Al-Búdikah"" afterwards used (Night dcclxxix) in the sense of crucible or melting-pot, in modern parlance a pipe-bowl; and also written ""Bútakah,"" an Arab distortion of the Persian ""Bútah.""
 Arab. ""Sindán"" or ""Sindiyán"" (Dozy). ""Sandán,"" anvil;
""Sindán,"" big, strong (Steingass).
 Arab. ""Kímíya,"" (see vol. i. 305) properly the substance which transmutes metals, the ""philosopher's stone"" which, by the by, is not a stone; and comes from , a fluid, a wet drug, as opposed to Iksír (Al-) a dry drug. Those who care to see how it is still studied will consult my History of Sindh (chapt. vii) and my experience which pointed only to the use made of it in base coinage. Hence in mod. tongue Kímiyáwi, an alchemist, means a coiner, a smasher. The reader must not suppose that the transmutation of metals is a dead study: I calculate that there are about one hundred workers in London alone.
 Arab. ""Al-Kír,"" a bellows also = Kúr, a furnace. For the full meaning of this sentence, see my ""Book of the Sword,"" p. 119.
 Lit. ""bade him lean upon it with the shears"" (Al-Káz).
 There are many kinds of Kohls (Hindos. Surmá and
Kajjal) used in medicine and magic. See Herklots, p. 227.
 Arab. ""Sabíkah"" = bar, lamina, from ""Sabk"" = melting, smelting: the lump in the crucible would be hammered out into an ingot in order to conceal the operation
 i.e. £375.
 Such report has cost many a life: the suspicion was and is still deadly as heresy in a ""new Christian"" under the Inquisition.
 Here there is a double entendre: openly it means, ""Few men recognise as they should the bond of bread and salt:"" the other sense would be (and that accounts for the smile), ""What the deuce do I care for the bond?""
 Arab. ""Kabbát"" in the Bresl. Edit. ""Ka'abán "": Lane (iii. 519) reads ""Ka'áb plur. of Ka'ab a cup.""
 A most palpable sneer. But Hasan is purposely represented as a ""softy"" till aroused and energized by the magic of Love.
 Arab. ""Al-iksír"" (see Night dcclxxix, supra p. 9): the Greek word which has returned from a trip to Arabia and reappeared in Europe as ""Elixir.""
 ""Awák"" plur. of ""Ukíyah,"" the well-known ""oke,"" or ""ocque,"" a weight varying from 1 to 2 lbs. In Morocco it is pronounced ""Wukíyah,"" and = the Spanish ounce (p. 279 Rudimentos del Arabe Vulgar, etc., by Fr. José de Lorchundi, Madrid, Rivadencyra, 1872).
 These lines have occurred in vol. iv. 267, where references to other places are given. I quote Lane by way of variety. In the text they are supposed to have been written by the Persian, a hint that Hasan would never be seen again.
 i.e. a superfetation of iniquity.
 Arab. ""Kurbán"" = offering, oblation to be brought to the priest's house or to the altar of the tribal God Yahveh, Jehovah (Levit. ii, 2-3 etc.). Amongst the Maronites Kurban is the host (-wafer) and amongst the Turks 'Id al-Kurban (sacrifice-feast) is the Greater Bayram, the time of Pilgrimage.
 Nár = fire, being feminine, like the names of the other ""elements.""
 The Egyptian Kurbáj of hippopotamus-hide (Burkh. Nubia, pp. 62,282) or elephant-hide (Turner ii. 365). Hence the Fr. Cravache (as Cravat is from Croat).
 In Mac. Edit. ""Bahriyah"": in Bresl. Edit. ""Nawátíyah.""
See vol. vi. 242, for , navita, nauta.
 In Bresl. Edit. (iv. 285) ""Yá Khwájah,"" for which see vol. vi. 46.
 Arab. ""Tabl"" (vulg. baz) = a kettle-drum about half a foot broad held in the left hand and beaten with a stick or leathern thong. Lane refers to his description (M.E. ii. chapt. v.) of the Dervish's drum of tinned copper with parchment face, and renders Zakhmah or Zukhmah (strap, stirrup-leather) by ""plectrum,"" which gives a wrong idea. The Bresl. Edit. ignores the strap.
 The ""Spartivento"" of Italy, mostly a tall headland which divides the clouds. The most remarkable feature of the kind is the Dalmatian Island, Pelagosa.
 The ""Rocs"" (Al-Arkhákh) in the Bresl. Edit. (iv. 290).
The Rakham = aquiline vulture.
 Lane here quotes a similar incident in the romance ""Sayf Zú al-Yazan,"" so called from the hero, whose son, Misr, is sewn up in a camel's hide by Bahrám, a treacherous Magian, and is carried by the Rukhs to a mountain-top.
 These lines occurred in Night xxvi. vol. i. 275: I quote
Mr. Payne for variety.
 Thus a Moslem can not only circumcise and marry himself but can also bury canonically himself. The form of this prayer is given by Lane M. E. chapt. xv.
 i.e. If I fail in my self-imposed duty, thou shalt charge me therewith on the Judgment-day.
 Arab. ""Al-Alwán,"" plur. of laun (colour). The latter in Egyptian Arabic means a ""dish of meat."" See Burckhardt No. 279. I repeat that the great traveller's ""Arabic Proverbs"" wants republishing for two reasons. First he had not sufficient command of English to translate with the necessary laconism and assonance: secondly in his day British Philistinism was too rampant to permit a literal translation. Consequently the book falls short of what the Oriental student requires; and I have prepared it for my friend Mr. Quaritch.
 i.e. Lofty, high-builded. See Night dcclxviii. vol. vii. p. 347. In the Bresl. Edit. Al-Masíd (as in Al-Kazwíni): in the Mac. Edit. Al-Mashid
 Arab. ""Munkati"" here = cut off from the rest of the world. Applied to a man, and a popular term of abuse in Al-Hijáz, it means one cut off from the blessings of Allah and the benefits of mankind; a pauvre sire. (Pilgrimage ii. 22.)
 Arab. ""Baras au Juzám,"" the two common forms of leprosy. See vol. iv. 51. Popular superstition in Syria holds that coition during the menses breeds the Juzám, Dáa al-Kabír (Great Evil) or Dáa al-Fíl (Elephantine Evil), i.e. Elephantiasis and that the days between the beginning of the flow (Sabíl) to that of coition shows the age when the progeny will be attacked; for instance if it take place on the first day, the disease will appear in the tenth year, on the fourth the fortieth and so on. The only diseases really dreaded by the Badawin are leprosy and small-pox. Coition during the menses is forbidden by all Eastern faiths under the severest penalties. Al-Mas'údi relates how a man thus begotten became a determined enemy of Ali; and the ancient Jews attributed the magical powers of Joshua Nazarenus to this accident of his birth, the popular idea being that sorcerers are thus impurely engendered.
 By adoption - See vol. iii. 151. This sudden affection (not love) suggests the ""Come to my arms, my slight acquaintance!"" of the Anti-Jacobin. But it is true to Eastern nature; and nothing can be more charming than this fast friendship between the Princess and Hasan.
 En tout bien et en tout honneur, be it understood.
 He had done nothing of the kind; but the feminine mind is prone to exaggeration. Also Hasan had told them a fib, to prejudice them against the Persian.
 These nervous movements have been reduced to a system in the Turk. ""Ihtilájnámeh"" = Book of palpitations, prognosticating from the subsultus tendinum and other involuntary movements of the body from head to foot; according to Ja'afar the Just, Daniel the Prophet, Alexander the Great; the Sages of Persia and the Wise Men of Greece. In England we attend chiefly to the eye and ear.
 Revenge, amongst the Arabs, is a sacred duty; and, in their state of civilization, society could not be kept together without it. So the slaughter of a villain is held to be a sacrifice to Allah, who amongst Christians claims for Himself the monopoly of vengeance.
 Arab. ""Zindík."" See vol. v. 230.
 Lane translates this ""put for him the remaining food and water;"" but Ai-Akhar (Mac. Edit.) evidently refers to the Najíb (dromedary).
 We can hardly see the heroism of the deed, but it must be remembered that Bahram was a wicked sorcerer, whom it was every good Moslem's bounden duty to slay. Compare the treatment of witches in England two centuries ago.
 The mother in Arab tales is ma mère, now becoming somewhat ridiculous in France on account of the over use of that venerable personage.
 The forbidden closet occurs also in Sayf Zú al-Yazan, who enters it and finds the bird-girls. Trébutien ii, 208 says, ""Il est assez remarquable qu'il existe en Allemagne une tradition à peu près semblable, et qui a fourni le sujet d'un des contes de Musaeus, entitulé, le voile enlevé."" Here Hasan is artfully left alone in a large palace without other companions but his thoughts and the reader is left to divine the train of ideas which drove him to open the door.
 Arab. ""Buhayrah"" (Bresl. Edit. ""Bahrah""), the tank or cistern in the Hosh (court-yard) of an Eastern house. Here, however, it is a rain-cistern on the flat roof of the palace (See Night dcccviii).
 This description of the view is one of the most gorgeous in The Nights.
 Here again are the ""Swan-maidens"" (See vol. v. 346) ""one of the primitive myths, the common heritage of the whole Aryan (Iranian) race."" In Persia Bahram-i-Gúr when carried off by the Dív Sapíd seizes the Peri's dove-coat: in Santháli folk-lore Torica, the Goatherd, steals the garment doffed by one of the daughters of the sun; and hence the twelve birds of Russian Story. To the same cycle belong the Seal-tales of the Faroe Islands (Thorpe's Northern Mythology) and the wise women or mermaids of Shetland (Hibbert). Wayland the smith captures a wife by seizing a mermaid's raiment and so did Sir Hagán by annexing the wardrobe of a Danubian water-nymph. Lettsom, the translator, mixes up this swan-raiment with that of the Valkyries or Choosers of the Slain. In real life stealing women's clothes is an old trick and has often induced them, after having been seen naked, to offer their persons spontaneously. Of this I knew two cases in India, where the theft is justified by divine example. The blue god Krishna, a barbarous and grotesque Hindu Apollo, robbed the raiment of the pretty Gopálís (cowherdesses) who were bathing in the Arjun River and carried them to the top of a Kunduna tree; nor would he restore them till he had reviewed the naked girls and taken one of them to wife. See also Imr al-Kays (of the Mu'allakah) with ""Onaiza"" at the port of Daratjuljul (Clouston's Arabian Poetry, p.4). A critic has complained of my tracing the origin of the Swan-maiden legend to the physical resemblance between the bird and a high-bred girl (vol. v. 346). I should have explained my theory which is shortly, that we must seek a material basis for all so-called supernaturalisms, and that anthropomorphism satisfactorily explains the Swan-maiden, as it does the angel and the devil. There is much to say on the subject; but this is not the place for long discussion.
 Arab. ""Nafs Ammárah,"" corresponding with our canting term ""The Flesh."" Nafs al-Nátíkah is the intellectual soul or function; Nafs al-Ghazabíyah = the animal function and Nafs al Shahwáníyah = the vegetative property.
 The lines occur in vol. ii. 331: I have quoted Mr.
Payne. Here they are singularly out of place.
 Not the ""green gown"" of Anglo-India i.e. a white ball-dress with blades of grass sticking to it in consequence of a ""fall backwards.""
 These lines occur in vol. i. 219: I have borrowed from
Torrens (p. 219).
 The appearance of which ends the fast and begins the
Lesser Festival. See vol. i. 84.
 See note, vol. i. 84, for notices of the large navel; much appreciated by Easterns.
 Arab. ""Shá'ir Al-Walahán"" = the love-distraught poet; Lane has ""a distracted poet."" My learned friend Professor Aloys Sprenger has consulted, upon the subject of Al-Walahán the well-known Professor of Arabic at Halle, Dr. Thorbeck, who remarks that the word (here as further on) must be an adjective, mad, love-distraught, not a ""lakab"" or poetical cognomen. He generally finds it written Al-Shá'ir al-Walahán (the love-demented poet) not Al-Walahán al-Shá'ir = Walahán the Poet. Note this burst of song after the sweet youth falls in love: it explains the cause of verse-quotation in The Nights, poetry being the natural language of love and battle.
 ""Them"" as usual for ""her.""
 Here Lane proposes a transposition, for ""Wa-huwá (and he) fi'l-hubbi,"" to read ""Fi 'l-hubbi wa huwa (wa-hwa);"" but the latter is given in the Mac. Edit.
 For the pun in ""Sabr""=aloe or patience. See vol. i. 138. In Herr Landberg (i. 93) we find a misunderstanding of the couplet—
""Aw'ákibu s-sabri (Kála ba'azuhum)
Mahmúdah: Kultu, 'khshi an takhirriní.'""
""The effects of patience"" (or aloes) quoth one ""are praiseworthy!"" Quoth I, ""Much I fear lest it make me stool."" Mahmúdah is not only un laxatif, but a slang name for a confection of aloes.
 Arab. ""Akúna fidá-ka."" Fidá = ransom, self-sacrifice and
Fidá'an = instead of. The phrase, which everywhere occurs in The
Nights, means, ""I would give my life to save thine ""
 Thus accounting for his sickness, improbably enough but in flattering way. Like a good friend (feminine) she does not hesitate a moment in prescribing a fib.
 i.e. the 25,000 Amazons who in the Bresl. Edit. (ii. 308) are all made to be the King's Banát"" = daughters or protégées. The Amazons of Dahome (see my ""Mission"") who may now number 5,000 are all officially wives of the King and are called by the lieges ""our mothers.""
 The tale-teller has made up his mind about the damsel; although in this part of the story she is the chief and eldest sister and subsequently she appears as the youngest daughter of the supreme Jinn King. The mystification is artfully explained by the extraordinary likeness of the two sisters. (See Night dcccxi.)
 This is a reminiscence of the old-fashioned ""marriage by capture,"" of which many traces survive, even among the civilised who wholly ignore their origin.
 Meaning her companions and suite.
 Arab. ""'Abáah"" vulg. ""'Abáyah."" See vol. ii. 133.
 Feet in the East lack that development of sebaceous glands which afflicts Europeans.
 i.e. cutting the animals' throats after Moslem law.
 In Night dcclxxviii. supra p.5, we find the orthodox Moslem doctrine that ""a single mortal is better in Allah's sight than a thousand Jinns."" For, I repeat, Al-Islam systematically exalts human nature which Christianity takes infinite trouble to degrade and debase. The results of its ignoble teaching are only too evident in the East: the Christians of the so-called (and miscalled) ""Holy Land"" are a disgrace to the faith and the idiomatic Persian term for a Nazarene is ""Tarsá"" = funker, coward.
 Arab. ""Sakaba Kúrahá;"" the forge in which children are hammered out?
 Arab. ""Má al-Maláhat"" = water (brilliancy) of beauty.
 The fourth of the Seven Heavens, the ""Garden of
Eternity,"" made of yellow coral.
 How strange this must sound to the Young Woman of London in the nineteenth century.
 ""Forty days"" is a quasi-religious period amongst Moslem for praying, fasting and religious exercises: here it represents our ""honey-moon."" See vol. v. p. 62.
 Yá layta, still popular. Herr Carlo Landberg (Proverbes et Dictons du Peuple Arabe, vol. i. of Syria, Leyden, E. J. Brill, 1883) explains layta for rayta (=raayta) by permutation of liquids and argues that the contraction is ancient (p. 42). But the Herr is no Arabist: ""Layta"" means ""would to Heaven,"" or, simply ""I wish,"" ""I pray"" (for something possible or impossible); whilst ""La'alla"" (perhaps, it may be) prays only for the possible: and both are simply particles governing the noun in the oblique or accusative case.
 ""His"" for ""her,"" i.e. herself, making somewhat of confusion between her state and that of her son.
 i.e. his mother; the words are not in the Mac. Edit.
 Baghdad is called House of Peace, amongst other reasons, from the Dijlah (Tigris) River and Valley ""of Peace."" The word was variously written Baghdád, Bághdád, (our old Bughdaud and Bagdat), Baghzáz, Baghzán, Baghdán, Baghzám and Maghdád as Makkah and Bakkah (Koran iii. 90). Religious Moslems held Bágh (idol) and Dád (gift) an ill-omened conjunction, and the Greeks changed it to Eirenopolis. (See Ouseley's Oriental Collcctions, vol. i. pp. 18-20.)
 This is a popular saying but hardly a ""vulgar proverb.""
(Lane iii. 522.) It reminds rather of Shakespear's:
""So loving to my mother,
That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
Visit her face too roughly.""
 i.e. God forbid that I should oppose thee!
 Here the writer again forgets apparently, that Shahrazad is speaking: she may, however, use the plural for the singular when speaking of herself.
 i.e. She would have pleaded ill-treatment and lawfully demanded to be sold.
 The Hindus speak of ""the only bond that woman knows—her heart.""
 i.e. a rarity, a present (especially in Persian).
 Arab. ""Al-bisát"" wa'l-masnad lit. the carpet and the cushion.
 For ""Báb al-bahr"" and ""Báb al-Barr"" see vol. iii. 281.
 She was the daughter of Ja'afar bin Mansúr; but, as will be seen, The Nights again and again called her father Al-Kásim.
 This is an error for the fifth which occurs in the popular saying, ""Is he the fifth of the sons of Al-Abbás!"" i.e. Harun al-Rashid. Lane (note, in loco) thus accounts for the frequent mention of the Caliph, the greatest of the Abbasides in The Nights. But this is a causa non causa.
 i.e. I find thy beauty all-sufficient. So the proverb ""The son of the quarter (young neighbour) filleth not the eye,"" which prefers a stranger.
 They are mere doggerel, like most of the pieces de circonstance.
 Afterwards called Wák Wák, and in the Bresl. Edit. Wák al-Wák. See Lane's notes upon these Islands. Arab Geographers evidently speak of two Wak Waks. Ibn al-Fakih and Al-Mas'údi (Fr. Transl., vol. iii. 6-7) locate one of them in East Africa beyond Zanzibar and Sofala. ""Le territoire des Zendjes (Zanzibar-Negroids) commence au canal (Al-Khalij) dérivé du haut Nil (the Juln River?) et se prolonge jusqu'au pays de Sofalah et des Wak-Wak."" It is simply the peninsula of Guardafui (Jard Hafun) occupied by the Gallas, pagans and Christians, before these were ousted by the Moslem Somal; and the former perpetually ejaculated ""Wak"" (God) as Moslems cry upon Allah. This identification explains a host of other myths such as the Amazons, who as Marco Polo tells us held the ""Female Island"" Socotra (Yule ii. 396). The fruit which resembled a woman's head (whence the puelloe Wakwakienses hanging by the hair from trees), and which when ripe called out ""Wak Wak"" and ""Allah al-Khallák"" (the Creator) refers to the Calabash-tree (Adausonia digitata), that grotesque growth, a vegetable elephant, whose gourds, something larger than a man's head, hang by a slender filament. Similarly the ""cocoa"" got its name, in Port. = Goblin, from the fancied face at one end. The other Wak Wak has been identified in turns with the Seychelles, Madagascar, Malacca, Sunda or Java (this by Langlès), China and Japan. The learned Prof. de Goeje (Arabishe Berichten over Japan, Amsterdam, Muller, 1880) informs us that in Canton the name of Japan is Wo-Kwok, possibly a corruption of Koku-tan, the ebony-tree (Diospyros ebenum) which Ibn Khor-dábah and others find together with gold in an island 4,500 parasangs from Suez and East of China. And we must remember that Basrah was the chief starting-place for the Celestial Empire during the rule of the Tang dynasty (seventh and ninth centuries). Colonel J. W. Watson of Bombay suggests New Guinea or the adjacent islands where the Bird of Paradise is said to cry ""Wak Wak!"" Mr. W. F. Kirby in the Preface (p. ix.) to his neat little book ""The New Arabian Nights,"" says: ""The Islands of Wak-Wak, seven years' journey from Bagdad, in the story of Hasan, have receded to a distance of a hundred and fifty years' journey in that of Majin (of Khorasan). There is no doubt(?) that the Cora Islands, near New Guinea, are intended; for the wonderful fruits which grow there are Birds of Paradise, which settle in flocks on the trees at sunset and sunrise, uttering this very cry."" Thus, like Ophir, Wak Wak has wandered all over the world and has been found even in Peru by the Turkish work Tárikh al-Hind al-Gharbi = History of the West Indies (Orient. Coll. iii 189).
 I accept the emendation of Lane's Shaykh, ""Nasím ""
(Zephyr) for ""Nadím "" (cup-companion).
 ""Jannat al-Ná'im"" = Garden of Delights is No. V Heaven, made of white diamond.
 This appears to her very prettily put.
 This is the ""House of Sadness"" of our old chivalrous Romances. See chapt. vi. of ""Palmerin of England,"" by Francisco de Moraes (ob. 1572), translated by old Anthony Munday (dateless, 1590?) and ""corrected"" (read spoiled) by Robert Southey, London, Longmans, 1807.
 The lines have occurred in Night clix. (vol. iii. 183), I quote Mr. Payne who, like Lane, prefers ""in my bosom"" to ""beneath my ribs.""
 In this tale the Bresl. Edit. more than once adds ""And let us and you send a blessing to the Lord of Lords"" (or to ""Mohammed,"" or to the ""Prophet""); and in vol. v. p. 52 has a long prayer. This is an act of contrition in the tale-teller for romancing against the expressed warning of the Founder of Al-Islam.
 From Bresl. Edit. (vi. 29): the four in the Mac. Edit. are too irrelevant.
 Arab. ""Ghayúr""—jealous, an admirable epithet which
Lane dilutes to ""changeable""—making a truism of a metaphor.
 These lines have occurred before. I quote Mr. Payne.
 i.e. One fated to live ten years.
 This poetical way of saying ""fourteen"" suggests Camoens
(The Lusiads) Canto v. 2.
 Arab. ""Surrah,"" lit. = a purse: a few lines lower down it is called ""'Ulbah"" = a box which, of course, may have contained the bag.
 The month which begins the Moslem year.
 As an Arab often does when deep in thought. Lane appositely quotes John viii. 6. ""Jonas stooped down, and with his finger wrote on the ground."" Mr. Payne translates, ""He fell a-drumming on the earth with his fingers,"" but this does not complete the sense.
 i.e.""And the peace of Allah be upon thee! that will end thy story."" The Arab formula, ""Wa al-Salám"" (pron. Wassalám) is used in a variety of senses.
 Like Camoens, one of the model lovers, he calls upon
Love to torment him still more—ad majorern Dei (amoris) gloriam.
 Pron. Aboor-Ruwaysh. ""The Father of the little Feather"": he is afterwards called ""Son of the daughter of the accursed Iblis""; yet, as Lane says, ""he appears to be a virtuous person.""
 Arab. ""Kantara al-lijám fi Karbús (bow) sarjih.""
 I do not translate ""beckoned"" because the word would give a wrong idea. Our beckoning with the finger moved towards the beckoner makes the so-beckoned Eastern depart in all haste. To call him you must wave the hand from you.
 The Arabs knew what large libraries were; and a learned man could not travel without camel-loads of dictionaries.
 Arab. ""Adim;"" now called Bulghár, our Moroccan leather.
 Arab. ""Zinád,"" which Lane renders by ""instruments for striking fire,"" and Mr. Payne, after the fashion of the translators of Al-Hariri, ""flint and steel.""
 A congener of Hasan and Husayn, little used except in Syria where it is a favourite name for Christians. The Muhít of Butrus Al-Bostáni (s.v.) tells us that it also means a bird called Abú Hasan and supplies various Egyptian synonyms. In Mod. Arab. Grammar the form Fa''úl is a diminutive as Hammúd for Ahmad, 'Ammúr for 'Amrú. So the fem. form, Fa''úlah, e.g. Khaddúgah = little Khadijah and Naffúsah=little Nafisah; Ar'úrah = little clitoris - whereas in Heb. it is an incrementative e.g. dabbúlah a large dablah (cake or lump of dried figs, etc.).
 In the Mac. Edit. ""Soldiers of Al-Daylam"" i.e. warlike as the Daylamites or Medes. See vol. ii. 94.
 Bilkís, it will be remembered, is the Arab. name of the
Queen of Sheba who visited Solomon. In Abyssinia she is termed
Kebra zá negest or zá makadá, the latter (according to Ferdinand
Werne's ""African Wanderings,"" Longmans, 1852) being synonymous
with Ityopia or Habash (Ethiopia or Abyssinia).
 Arab. ""Dakkah,"" which Lane translates by ""settee.""
 Arab. ""Ambar al-Khám"" the latter word (raw) being pure
Persian.
 The author neglects to mention the ugliest part of old-womanhood in the East, long empty breasts like tobacco-pouches. In youth the bosom is beautifully high, arched and rounded, firm as stone to the touch, with the nipples erect and pointing outwards. But after the girl-mother's first child (in Europe le premier embellit) all changes. Nature and bodily power have been overtasked; then comes the long suckling at the mother's expense: the extension of the skin and the enlargement of its vessels are too sudden and rapid for the diminished ability of contraction and the bad food aids in the continual consumption of vitality. Hence, among Eastern women age and ugliness are synonymous. It is only in the highest civilisation that we find the handsome old woman.
 The name has occurred in the Knightly tale of King Omar and his sons, Vol. ii. 269. She is here called Mother of Calamities,but in p. 123, Vol. iv. of the Mac. Edit. she becomes ""Lady (Zát) al-Dawáhi."" It will be remembered that the title means calamitous to the foe.
 By this address she assured him that she had no design upon his chastity. In Moslem lands it is always advisable to accost a strange woman, no matter how young, with, ""Yá Ummí!"" = O my mother. This is pledging one's word, as it were, not to make love to her.
 Apparently the Wakites numbered their Islands as the Anglo-Americans do their streets. For this they have been charged with ""want of imagination""; but the custom is strictly classical. See at Pompeii ""Reg (io) I; Ins (ula) 1, Via Prima, Secunda,"" etc.
 These are the Puellæ Wakwakienses of whom Ibn Al-Wardi relates after an ocular witness, ""Here too is a tree which bears fruits like women who have fair faces and are hung by their hair. They come forth from integuments like large leathern bags (calabash-gourds?) and when they sense air and sun they cry 'Wak! Wak!' (God! God!) till their hair is cut, and when it is cut they die; and the islanders understand this cry wherefrom they augure ill."" The Ajáib al-Hind (chapt. xv.) places in Wak-land the Samandal, a bird which enters the fire without being burnt evidently the Egyptian ""Pi-Benni,"" which the Greeks metamorphised to ""Phoenix."" It also mentions a hare-like animal, now male then female, and the Somal behind Cape Guardafui tell the same tale of their Cynhyænas.
 i.e. I will keep thee as though thou wert the apple of my eye.
 A mere exaggeration of the ""Gull-fairs"" noted by travellers in sundry islands as Ascension and the rock off Brazilian Santos.
 Arab. ""Kámil wa Basít wa Wáfir"" = the names of three popular metres, for which see the Terminal Essay.
 Arab. ""Manáshif"" = drying towels, Plur. of Minshafah, and the popular term which Dr. Jonathan Swift corrupted to ""Munnassaf."" Lane (Nights, Introduct. p. ix.).
 Arab. ""Shafaif"" opposed to ""Shafah"" the mouth-lips.
 Fountains of Paradise. This description is a fair instance of how the Saj'a (prose-rhyme) dislocates the order; an Arab begins with hair, forehead, eyebrows and lashes and when he reaches the nose, he slips down to the toes for the sake of the assonance. If the latter be neglected the whole list of charms must be otherwise ordered; and the student will compare Mr. Payne's version of this passage with mine.
 A fair specimen of the Arab logogriph derived from the Abjad Alphabet which contains only the Hebrew and Syriac letters not the six Arabic. Thus 4 X 5=20 which represents the Kaf (K) and 6 X 10=60, or Sin (S). The whole word is thus ""Kos"", the Greek or , and the lowest word, in Persian as in Arabic, for the female pudenda, extensively used in vulgar abuse. In my youth we had at the University something of the kind,
To five and five and fifty-five
The first of letters add
To make a thing to please a King
And drive a wise man mad.
Answer VVLVA. Very interesting to the anthropological student is this excursus of Hasan, who after all manner of hardships and horrors and risking his life to recover his wife and children, breaks out into song on the subject of her privities. And it can hardly be tale-teller's gag as both verse and prose show considerable art in composition. (See p. 348.)
Supplementary Note To Hasan of Bassorah.
Note(p.93)—There is something wondrous naïve in a lover who, when asked by his mistress to sing a song in her honour, breaks out into versical praises of her parts. But even the classical Arab authors did not disdain such themes. See in Al-Harírí (Ass. of Mayyáfarikín) where Abú Zayd laments the impotency of old age in form of a Rasy or funeral oration (Preston p. 484, and Chenery p. 221). It completely deceived Sir William Jones, who inserted it into the chapter ""De Poesi Funebri,"" p. 527 (Poeseos Asiaticæ Commentarii), gravely noting, ""Hæc Elegia non admodum dissimilis esse videtur pulcherrimi illius carminis de Sauli et Jonathani obitu; at que adeò versus iste ubi provocant adversarios nunquam rediit a pugnæ contentione sine spiculo sanguine imbuto, ex Hebræoreddi videtur,
A sanguine occisorum, a fortium virorum adipe,
Arcus Jonathani non rediit irritus.""
I need hardly say with Captain Lockett (226) that this ""Sabb warrior,"" this Arabian Achilles, is the celebrated Bonus Deus or Hellespontiacus of the Ancients. The oration runs thus:—
O folk I have a wondrous tale, so rare
Much shall it profit hearers wise and ware!
I saw in salad-years a potent Brave
And sharp of edge and point his warrior glaive;
Who entered joust and list with hardiment
Fearless of risk, of victory confident,
His vigorous onset straitest places oped
And easy passage through all narrows groped:
He ne'er encountered foe in single fight
But came from tilt with spear in blood stained bright;
Nor stormed a fortress howso strong and stark—
With fencèd gates defended deep and dark—
When shown his flag without th' auspicious cry
""Aidance from Allah and fair victory nigh!""
Thus wise full many a night his part he played
In strength and youthtide's stately garb arrayed,
Dealing to fair young girl delicious joy
And no less welcome to the blooming boy.
But Time ne'er ceased to stint his wondrous strength
(Steadfast and upright as the gallow's length)
Until the Nights o'erthrew him by their might
And friends contemned him for a feckless wight;
Nor was a wizard but who wasted skill
Over his case, nor leach could heal his ill.
Then he abandoned arms abandoned him
Who gave and took salutes so fierce and grim;
And now lies prostrate drooping haughty crest;
For who lives longest him most ills molest.
Then see him, here he lies on bier for bet;—
Who will a shroud bestow on stranger dead?
A fair measure of the difference between Eastern and Western manners is afforded by such a theme being treated by their gravest writers and the verses being read and heard by the gravest and most worshipful men, whilst amongst us Preston and Chenery do not dare even to translate them. The latter, indeed, had all that immodest modesty for which English professional society is notable in this xixth century. He spoiled by needlessly excluding from a scientific publication (Mem. R.A.S.) all of my Proverbia Communia Syriaca (see Unexplored Sryia, i. 364) and every item which had a shade of double entendre. But Nemesis frequently found him out: during his short and obscure rule in Printing House Square, The Thunderer was distinguished by two of the foulest indecencies that ever appeared in an English paper.
The well-known Koranic verse, whereby Allah is introduced into an indecent tale and ""Holy Writ"" is punned upon. I have noticed (iii. 206) that victory Fat'h lit.=opening everything (as e.g. a maidenhead).
 Egyptian and Syrian vulgar term for Mawálíyah or Mawáliyah, a short poem on subjects either classical or vulgar. It generally consists of five lines all rhyming except the penultimate. The metre is a species of the Basít which, however, admits of considerable poetical license; this being according to Lane the usual ""Weight,""
/ / / .
The scheme is distinctly anapæstic and Mr. Lyall (Translations of Ancient Arabic Poetry) compares with a cognate metre, the Tawíl, certain lines in Abt Vogler, e.g.
""Ye know why the forms are fair, ye hear how the tale is told.""
 i.e. repeat the chapter of the Koran termed The Opening, and beginning with these words, ""Have we not opened thy breast for thee and eased thee of thy burden which galled thy back? *** Verily with the difficulty cometh ease!""—Koran xciv. vol. 1, 5.
 Lane renders Nur al-Hudà (Light of Salvation) by Light of Day which would be Nur al-Hadà.
 In the Bresl. Edit. ""Yá Salám""=O safety!—a vulgar ejaculation.
 A favourite idiom meaning from the mischief which may (or will) come from the Queen.
 He is not strong-minded but his feminine persistency of purpose, likest to that of a sitting hen, is confirmed by the ""Consolations of religion."" The character is delicately drawn.
 In token that she intended to act like a man.
 This is not rare even in real life: Moslem women often hide and change their names for superstitious reasons, from the husband and his family.
 Arab. ""Sabab"" which also means cause. Vol. ii. 14.
There is the same metaphorical use of ""Habl""= cord and cause.
 Arab. ""Himà,"" a word often occurring in Arab poetry, domain, a pasture or watered land forcibly kept as far as a dog's bark would sound by some masterful chief like ""King Kulayb."" (See vol. ii. 77.) This tenure was forbidden by Mohammed except for Allah and the Apostle (i.e. himself). Lane translates it ""asylum.""
 She was a maid and had long been of marriageable age.
 The young man had evidently ""kissed the Blarney stone""; but the flattery is the more telling as he speaks from the heart.
 ""Inshallah "" here being= D. V.
 i.e. The ""Place of Light"" (Pharos), or of Splendour. Here we find that Hasan's wife is the youngest sister, but with an extraordinary resemblance to the eldest, a very masterful young person. The anagnorisis is admirably well managed.
 i.e. the sweetmeats of the feast provided for the returning traveller. The old woman (like others) cannot resist the temptation of a young man's lips. Happily for him she goes so far and no farther.
 The first, fourth, fifth and last names have already occurred: the others are in order, Star o' Morn, Sun of Undtirn and Honour of Maidenhood. They are not merely fanciful, but are still used in Egypt and Syria.
 Arab. ""Fájirah"" and elsewhere ""Ahirah,"" =whore and strumpet used often in loose talk as mere abuse without special meaning.
 This to Westerns would seem a most improbable detail, but Easterns have their own ideas concerning ""Al-Muhabbat al-ghariziyah"" =natural affection, blood speaking to blood, etc.
 One of the Hells (see vol. iv. 143). Here it may be advisable to give the names of the Seven Heavens (which are evidently based upon Ptolemaic astronomy) and which correspond with the Seven Hells after the fashion of Arabian system-mania. (1) Dar al-Jalál (House of Glory) made of pearls; (2) Dár al-Salám (of Rest), rubies and jacinths; (3) Jannat al-Maawá (Garden of Mansions, not ""of mirrors,"" as Herklots has it, p. 98), made of yellow copper; (4) Jannat al-Khuld (of Eternity), yellow coral; (5) Jannat al-Na'ím (of Delights), white diamond; (6) Jannat al-Firdaus (of Paradise), red gold; and (7) Jannat al-'Adn (of Eden, or Al-Karár= of everlasting abode, which some make No. 8), of red pearls or pure musk. The seven Hells are given in vol. v. 241; they are intended for Moslems (Jahannam); Christians (Lazà); Jews (Hutamah); Sabians (Sa'ir); Guebles (Sakar); Pagans or idolaters (Jahím); and Hypocrites (Háwiyah).
 Arab. ""'Atb,"" more literally= ""blame,"" ""reproach.""
 Bresl. Edit. In the Mac. ""it returned to the place whence I had brought it""—an inferior reading.
 The dreams play an important part in the Romances of Chivalry, e.g. the dream of King Perion in Amadis de Gaul, chapt. ii. (London; Longmans, 1803).
 Amongst Moslems bastardy is a sore offence and a love-child is exceedingly rare. The girl is not only carefully guarded but she also guards herself knowing that otherwise she will not find a husband. Hence seduction is all but unknown. The wife is equally well guarded and lacks opportunities hence adultery is found difficult except in books. Of the Ibn (or Walad) Harám (bastard as opposed to the Ibn Halál) the proverb says, ""This child is not thine, so the madder he be the more is thy glee!"" Yet strange to say public prostitution has never been wholly abolished in Al-Islam. Al-Mas'údi tells us that in Arabia were public prostitutes'(Bagháyá), even before the days of the Apostle, who affected certain quarters as in our day the Tartúshah of Alexandria and the Hosh Bardak of Cairo. Here says Herr Carlo Landberg (p. 57, Syrian Proverbs) ""Elles parlent une langue toute à elle."" So pretentious and dogmatic a writer as the author of Proverbes et Dictons de la Province de Syrie, ought surely to have known that the Hosh Bardak is the head-quarters of the Cairene Gypsies. This author, who seems to write in order to learn, reminds me of an acute Oxonian undergraduate of my day who, when advised to take a ""coach,"" became a ""coach"" himself.
 These lines occur in vol. vii. p. 340. I quote Mr.
Payne.
 She shows all the semi-maniacal rancour of a good woman, or rather a woman who has not broken the eleventh commandment, ""Thou shalt not be found out,"" against an erring sister who has been discovered. In the East also these unco'gúid dames have had, and too often have, the power to carry into effect the cruelty and diabolical malignity which in London and Paris must vent itself in scan. mag. and anonymous letters.
 These faintings and trances are as common in the Romances of Chivalry e.g. Amadis of Gaul, where they unlace the garments to give more liberty, pour cold water on the face and bathe the temples and pulses with diluted vinegar (for rose water) exactly as they do in The Nights.
 So Hafiz, ""Bád-i-Sabá chu bugzarí"" etc.
 Arab. ""Takiyah."" See vol. i. 224 and for the Tarn-Kappe vol. iv. p. 176. In the Sinthásana Dwatrinsati (vulgo. Singhásan Battísí), or Thirty-two Tales of a Throne, we find a bag always full of gold, a bottomless purse; earth which rubbed on the forehead overcomes all; a rod which during the first watch of the night furnishes jewelled ornaments; in the second a beautiful girl; in the third invisibility, and in the fourth a deadly foe or death; a flower-garland which renders the possessor invisible and an unfading lotus-flower which produces a diamond every day.
 Arab. ""Judad,"" plur. of Jadíd, lit.= new coin, ergo applied to those old and obsolete; 10 Judad were= one nusf or half dirham.
 Arab. ""Raff,"" a shelf proper, running round the room about 7-7½ feet from the ground. During my day it was the fashion in Damascus to range in line along the Raff splendid porcelain bowls brought by the Caravans in olden days from China, whilst on the table were placed French and English specimens of white and gold ""china"" worth perhaps a franc each.
 Lane supposes that the glass and china-ware had fallen upon the divan running round the walls under the Raff and were not broken.
 These lines have occurred in Night dclxxxix. vol. vii. p. 119. I quote Lane.
 The lines have occurred before. I quote Mr. Payne.
 This formula, I repeat, especially distinguishes the
Tale of Hasan of Bassorah.
 These lines have occurred in vol. 1. 249. I quote Lane.
 She speaks to the ""Gallery,"" who would enjoy a loud laugh against Mistress Gadabout. The end of the sentence must speak to the heart of many a widow.
 These lines occur in vol. i. 25: so I quote Mr. Payne.
 Arab. ""Musáhikah;"" the more usual term for a Tribade is ""Sahíkah"" from ""Sahk"" in the sense of rubbing: both also are applied to onanists and masturbators of the gender feminine.
 i.e. by way of halter. This jar is like the cask in Auerbach's Keller; and has already been used by witches; Night dlxxxvii. vol. vi. 158.
 Here they are ten but afterwards they are reduced to seven: I see no reason for changing the text with Lane and Payne.
 Wazir of Solomon. See vol. i. 42; and vol. iii. 97.
 Arab. ""Ism al-A'azam,"" the Ineffable Name, a superstition evidently derived from the Talmudic fancies of the Jews concerning their tribal god, Yah or Yahvah.
 The tradition is that Mohámmed asked Akáf al-Wadá'ah ""Hast a wife?""; and when answered in the negative, ""Then thou appertainest to the brotherhood of Satans! An thou wilt be one of the Christian monks then company therewithal; but an thou be of us, know that it is our custom to marry!""
 The old woman, in the East as in the West, being the most vindictive of her kind. I have noted (Pilgrimage iii. 70) that a Badawi will sometimes though in shame take the blood-wit; but that if it be offered to an old woman she will dash it to the ground and clutch her knife and fiercely swear by Allah that she will not eat her son's blood.
 Neither dome nor fount etc. are mentioned before, the normal inadvertency.
 In Eastern travel the rest comes before the eating and drinking.
 Arab. ""'Id"" (pron.'Eed) which I have said (vol. i. 42, 317) is applied to the two great annual festivals, the ""Fête of Sacrifice,"" and the ""Break-Fast."" The word denotes restoration to favour and Moslems explain as the day on which Adam (and Eve) who had been expelled from Paradise for disobedience was re-established (Uída) by the relenting of Allah. But the name doubtless dates amongst Arabs from days long before they had heard of the ""Lord Nomenclator.""
 Alluding to Hasan seizing her feather dress and so taking her to wife.
 Arab. ""Kharajú""=they (masc.) went forth, a vulgarism for ""Kharajna"" (fem.)
 Note the notable housewife who, at a moment when youth would forget everything, looks to the main chance.
 Arab. ""Al-Malakút"" (not ""Malkút"" as in Freytag) a Sufi term for the world of Spirits (De Lacy Christ, Ar. i. 451). Amongst Eastern Christians it is vulgarly used in the fem. and means the Kingdom of Heaven, also the preaching of the Gospel."

If you cram a turkey say on chestnutmeal it tastes like that. Eat pig like pig. But then why is it that saltwater fish are not salty? How is that?
His eyes sought answer from the river and saw a rowboat rock at anchor on the treacly swells lazily its plastered board.
Kino's 11/- Trousers
Good idea that. Wonder if he pays rent to the corporation. How can you own water really? It's always flowing in a stream, never the same, which in the stream of life we trace. Because life is a stream. All kinds of places are good for ads. That quack doctor for the clap used to be stuck up in all the greenhouses. Never see it now. Strictly confidential. Dr Hy Franks. Didn't cost him a red like Maginni the dancing master self advertisement. Got fellows to stick them up or stick them up himself for that matter on the q. t. running in to loosen a button. Flybynight. Just the place too. POST NO BILLS. POST 110 PILLS. Some chap with a dose burning him.
If he...?
O!
Eh?
No... No.
No, no. I don't believe it. He wouldn't surely?
No, no.
Mr Bloom moved forward, raising his troubled eyes. Think no more about that. After one. Timeball on the ballastoffice is down. Dunsink time. Fascinating little book that is of sir Robert Ball's. Parallax. I never exactly understood. There's a priest. Could ask him. Par it's Greek: parallel, parallax. Met him pike hoses she called it till I told her about the transmigration. O rocks!
Mr Bloom smiled O rocks at two windows of the ballastoffice. She's right after all. Only big words for ordinary things on account of the sound. She's not exactly witty. Can be rude too. Blurt out what I was thinking. Still, I don't know. She used to say Ben Dollard had a base barreltone voice. He has legs like barrels and you'd think he was singing into a barrel. Now, isn't that wit. They used to call him big Ben. Not half as witty as calling him base barreltone. Appetite like an albatross. Get outside of a baron of beef. Powerful man he was at stowing away number one Bass. Barrel of Bass. See? It all works out.
A procession of whitesmocked sandwichmen marched slowly towards him along the gutter, scarlet sashes across their boards. Bargains. Like that priest they are this morning: we have sinned: we have suffered. He read the scarlet letters on their five tall white hats: H. E. L. Y. S. Wisdom Hely's. Y lagging behind drew a chunk of bread from under his foreboard, crammed it into his mouth and munched as he walked. Our staple food. Three bob a day, walking along the gutters, street after street. Just keep skin and bone together, bread and skilly. They are not Boyl: no, M Glade's men. Doesn't bring in any business either. I suggested to him about a transparent showcart with two smart girls sitting inside writing letters, copybooks, envelopes, blottingpaper. I bet that would have caught on. Smart girls writing something catch the eye at once. Everyone dying to know what she's writing. Get twenty of them round you if you stare at nothing. Have a finger in the pie. Women too. Curiosity. Pillar of salt. Wouldn't have it of course because he didn't think of it himself first. Or the inkbottle I suggested with a false stain of black celluloid. His ideas for ads like Plumtree's potted under the obituaries, cold meat department. You can't lick 'em. What? Our envelopes. Hello, Jones, where are you going? Can't stop, Robinson, I am hastening to purchase the only reliable inkeraser Kansell, sold by Hely's Ltd, 85 Dame street. Well out of that ruck I am. Devil of a job it was collecting accounts of those convents. Tranquilla convent. That was a nice nun there, really sweet face. Wimple suited her small head. Sister? Sister? I am sure she was crossed in love by her eyes. Very hard to bargain with that sort of a woman. I disturbed her at her devotions that morning. But glad to communicate with the outside world. Our great day, she said. Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. Sweet name too: caramel. She knew I, I think she knew by the way she. If she had married she would have changed. I suppose they really were short of money. Fried everything in the best butter all the same. No lard for them. My heart's broke eating dripping. They like buttering themselves in and out. Molly tasting it, her veil up. Sister? Pat Claffey, the pawnbroker's daughter. It was a nun they say invented barbed wire.
He crossed Westmoreland street when apostrophe S had plodded by. Rover cycleshop. Those races are on today. How long ago is that? Year Phil Gilligan died. We were in Lombard street west. Wait: was in Thom's. Got the job in Wisdom Hely's year we married. Six years. Ten years ago: ninetyfour he died yes that's right the big fire at Arnott's. Val Dillon was lord mayor. The Glencree dinner. Alderman Robert O'Reilly emptying the port into his soup before the flag fell. Bobbob lapping it for the inner alderman. Couldn't hear what the band played. For what we have already received may the Lord make us. Milly was a kiddy then. Molly had that elephantgrey dress with the braided frogs. Mantailored with selfcovered buttons. She didn't like it because I sprained my ankle first day she wore choir picnic at the Sugarloaf. As if that. Old Goodwin's tall hat done up with some sticky stuff. Flies' picnic too. Never put a dress on her back like it. Fitted her like a glove, shoulders and hips. Just beginning to plump it out well. Rabbitpie we had that day. People looking after her.
Happy. Happier then. Snug little room that was with the red wallpaper. Dockrell's, one and ninepence a dozen. Milly's tubbing night. American soap I bought: elderflower. Cosy smell of her bathwater. Funny she looked soaped all over. Shapely too. Now photography. Poor papa's daguerreotype atelier he told me of. Hereditary taste.
He walked along the curbstone.
Stream of life. What was the name of that priestylooking chap was always squinting in when he passed? Weak eyes, woman. Stopped in Citron's saint Kevin's parade. Pen something. Pendennis? My memory is getting. Pen ...? Of course it's years ago. Noise of the trams probably. Well, if he couldn't remember the dayfather's name that he sees every day.
Bartell d'Arcy was the tenor, just coming out then. Seeing her home after practice. Conceited fellow with his waxedup moustache. Gave her that song Winds that blow from the south.
Windy night that was I went to fetch her there was that lodge meeting on about those lottery tickets after Goodwin's concert in the supperroom or oakroom of the Mansion house. He and I behind. Sheet of her music blew out of my hand against the High school railings. Lucky it didn't. Thing like that spoils the effect of a night for her. Professor Goodwin linking her in front. Shaky on his pins, poor old sot. His farewell concerts. Positively last appearance on any stage. May be for months and may be for never. Remember her laughing at the wind, her blizzard collar up. Corner of Harcourt road remember that gust. Brrfoo! Blew up all her skirts and her boa nearly smothered old Goodwin. She did get flushed in the wind. Remember when we got home raking up the fire and frying up those pieces of lap of mutton for her supper with the Chutney sauce she liked. And the mulled rum. Could see her in the bedroom from the hearth unclamping the busk of her stays: white.
Swish and soft flop her stays made on the bed. Always warm from her. Always liked to let her self out. Sitting there after till near two taking out her hairpins. Milly tucked up in beddyhouse. Happy. Happy. That was the night...
—O, Mr Bloom, how do you do?
—O, how do you do, Mrs Breen?
—No use complaining. How is Molly those times? Haven't seen her for ages.
—In the pink, Mr Bloom said gaily. Milly has a position down in Mullingar, you know.
—Go away! Isn't that grand for her?
—Yes. In a photographer's there. Getting on like a house on fire. How are all your charges?
—All on the baker's list, Mrs Breen said.
How many has she? No other in sight.
—You're in black, I see. You have no...
—No, Mr Bloom said. I have just come from a funeral.
Going to crop up all day, I foresee. Who's dead, when and what did he die of? Turn up like a bad penny.
—O, dear me, Mrs Breen said. I hope it wasn't any near relation.
May as well get her sympathy.
—Dignam, Mr Bloom said. An old friend of mine. He died quite suddenly, poor fellow. Heart trouble, I believe. Funeral was this morning.
Your funeral's tomorrow While you're coming through the rye. Diddlediddle dumdum Diddlediddle...
—Sad to lose the old friends, Mrs Breen's womaneyes said melancholily.
Now that's quite enough about that. Just: quietly: husband.
—And your lord and master?
Mrs Breen turned up her two large eyes. Hasn't lost them anyhow.
—O, don't be talking! she said. He's a caution to rattlesnakes. He's in there now with his lawbooks finding out the law of libel. He has me heartscalded. Wait till I show you.
Hot mockturtle vapour and steam of newbaked jampuffs rolypoly poured out from Harrison's. The heavy noonreek tickled the top of Mr Bloom's gullet. Want to make good pastry, butter, best flour, Demerara sugar, or they'd taste it with the hot tea. Or is it from her? A barefoot arab stood over the grating, breathing in the fumes. Deaden the gnaw of hunger that way. Pleasure or pain is it? Penny dinner. Knife and fork chained to the table.
Opening her handbag, chipped leather. Hatpin: ought to have a guard on those things. Stick it in a chap's eye in the tram. Rummaging. Open. Money. Please take one. Devils if they lose sixpence. Raise Cain. Husband barging. Where's the ten shillings I gave you on Monday? Are you feeding your little brother's family? Soiled handkerchief: medicinebottle. Pastille that was fell. What is she?...
—There must be a new moon out, she said. He's always bad then. Do you know what he did last night?
Her hand ceased to rummage. Her eyes fixed themselves on him, wide in alarm, yet smiling.
—What? Mr Bloom asked.
Let her speak. Look straight in her eyes. I believe you. Trust me.
—Woke me up in the night, she said. Dream he had, a nightmare.
Indiges.
—Said the ace of spades was walking up the stairs.
—The ace of spades! Mr Bloom said.
She took a folded postcard from her handbag.
—Read that, she said. He got it this morning.
—What is it? Mr Bloom asked, taking the card. U.P.?
—U.P.: up, she said. Someone taking a rise out of him. It's a great shame for them whoever he is.
—Indeed it is, Mr Bloom said.
She took back the card, sighing.
—And now he's going round to Mr Menton's office. He's going to take an action for ten thousand pounds, he says.
She folded the card into her untidy bag and snapped the catch.
Same blue serge dress she had two years ago, the nap bleaching. Seen its best days. Wispish hair over her ears. And that dowdy toque: three old grapes to take the harm out of it. Shabby genteel. She used to be a tasty dresser. Lines round her mouth. Only a year or so older than Molly.
See the eye that woman gave her, passing. Cruel. The unfair sex.
He looked still at her, holding back behind his look his discontent. Pungent mockturtle oxtail mulligatawny. I'm hungry too. Flakes of pastry on the gusset of her dress: daub of sugary flour stuck to her cheek. Rhubarb tart with liberal fillings, rich fruit interior. Josie Powell that was. In Luke Doyle's long ago. Dolphin's Barn, the charades. U.P.: up.
Change the subject.
—Do you ever see anything of Mrs Beaufoy? Mr Bloom asked.
—Mina Purefoy? she said.
Philip Beaufoy I was thinking. Playgoers' Club. Matcham often thinks of the masterstroke. Did I pull the chain? Yes. The last act.
—Yes.
—I just called to ask on the way in is she over it. She's in the lying-in hospital in Holles street. Dr Horne got her in. She's three days bad now.
—O, Mr Bloom said. I'm sorry to hear that.
—Yes, Mrs Breen said. And a houseful of kids at home. It's a very stiff birth, the nurse told me.
—-O, Mr Bloom said.
His heavy pitying gaze absorbed her news. His tongue clacked in compassion. Dth! Dth!
—I'm sorry to hear that, he said. Poor thing! Three days! That's terrible for her.
Mrs Breen nodded.
—She was taken bad on the Tuesday...
Mr Bloom touched her funnybone gently, warning her:
—Mind! Let this man pass.
A bony form strode along the curbstone from the river staring with a rapt gaze into the sunlight through a heavystringed glass. Tight as a skullpiece a tiny hat gripped his head. From his arm a folded dustcoat, a stick and an umbrella dangled to his stride.
—Watch him, Mr Bloom said. He always walks outside the lampposts. Watch!
—Who is he if it's a fair question? Mrs Breen asked. Is he dotty?
—His name is Cashel Boyle O'Connor Fitzmaurice Tisdall Farrell, Mr Bloom said smiling. Watch!
—He has enough of them, she said. Denis will be like that one of these days.
She broke off suddenly.
—There he is, she said. I must go after him. Goodbye. Remember me to Molly, won't you?
—I will, Mr Bloom said.
He watched her dodge through passers towards the shopfronts. Denis Breen in skimpy frockcoat and blue canvas shoes shuffled out of Harrison's hugging two heavy tomes to his ribs. Blown in from the bay. Like old times. He suffered her to overtake him without surprise and thrust his dull grey beard towards her, his loose jaw wagging as he spoke earnestly.
Meshuggah. Off his chump.
Mr Bloom walked on again easily, seeing ahead of him in sunlight the tight skullpiece, the dangling stickumbrelladustcoat. Going the two days. Watch him! Out he goes again. One way of getting on in the world. And that other old mosey lunatic in those duds. Hard time she must have with him.
U.P.: up. I'll take my oath that's Alf Bergan or Richie Goulding. Wrote it for a lark in the Scotch house I bet anything. Round to Menton's office. His oyster eyes staring at the postcard. Be a feast for the gods.
He passed the Irish Times. There might be other answers Iying there. Like to answer them all. Good system for criminals. Code. At their lunch now. Clerk with the glasses there doesn't know me. O, leave them there to simmer. Enough bother wading through fortyfour of them. Wanted, smart lady typist to aid gentleman in literary work. I called you naughty darling because I do not like that other world. Please tell me what is the meaning. Please tell me what perfume does your wife. Tell me who made the world. The way they spring those questions on you. And the other one Lizzie Twigg. My literary efforts have had the good fortune to meet with the approval of the eminent poet A. E. (Mr Geo. Russell). No time to do her hair drinking sloppy tea with a book of poetry.
Best paper by long chalks for a small ad. Got the provinces now. Cook and general, exc. cuisine, housemaid kept. Wanted live man for spirit counter. Resp. girl (R.C.) wishes to hear of post in fruit or pork shop. James Carlisle made that. Six and a half per cent dividend. Made a big deal on Coates's shares. Ca' canny. Cunning old Scotch hunks. All the toady news. Our gracious and popular vicereine. Bought the Irish Field now. Lady Mountcashel has quite recovered after her confinement and rode out with the Ward Union staghounds at the enlargement yesterday at Rathoath. Uneatable fox. Pothunters too. Fear injects juices make it tender enough for them. Riding astride. Sit her horse like a man. Weightcarrying huntress. No sidesaddle or pillion for her, not for Joe. First to the meet and in at the death. Strong as a brood mare some of those horsey women. Swagger around livery stables. Toss off a glass of brandy neat while you'd say knife. That one at the Grosvenor this morning. Up with her on the car: wishswish. Stonewall or fivebarred gate put her mount to it. Think that pugnosed driver did it out of spite. Who is this she was like? O yes! Mrs Miriam Dandrade that sold me her old wraps and black underclothes in the Shelbourne hotel. Divorced Spanish American. Didn't take a feather out of her my handling them. As if I was her clotheshorse. Saw her in the viceregal party when Stubbs the park ranger got me in with Whelan of the Express. Scavenging what the quality left. High tea. Mayonnaise I poured on the plums thinking it was custard. Her ears ought to have tingled for a few weeks after. Want to be a bull for her. Born courtesan. No nursery work for her, thanks.
Poor Mrs Purefoy! Methodist husband. Method in his madness. Saffron bun and milk and soda lunch in the educational dairy. Y. M. C. A. Eating with a stopwatch, thirtytwo chews to the minute. And still his muttonchop whiskers grew. Supposed to be well connected. Theodore's cousin in Dublin Castle. One tony relative in every family. Hardy annuals he presents her with. Saw him out at the Three Jolly Topers marching along bareheaded and his eldest boy carrying one in a marketnet. The squallers. Poor thing! Then having to give the breast year after year all hours of the night. Selfish those t.t's are. Dog in the manger. Only one lump of sugar in my tea, if you please.
He stood at Fleet street crossing. Luncheon interval. A sixpenny at Rowe's? Must look up that ad in the national library. An eightpenny in the Burton. Better. On my way.
He walked on past Bolton's Westmoreland house. Tea. Tea. Tea. I forgot to tap Tom Kernan.
Sss. Dth, dth, dth! Three days imagine groaning on a bed with a vinegared handkerchief round her forehead, her belly swollen out. Phew! Dreadful simply! Child's head too big: forceps. Doubled up inside her trying to butt its way out blindly, groping for the way out. Kill me that would. Lucky Molly got over hers lightly. They ought to invent something to stop that. Life with hard labour. Twilight sleep idea: queen Victoria was given that. Nine she had. A good layer. Old woman that lived in a shoe she had so many children. Suppose he was consumptive. Time someone thought about it instead of gassing about the what was it the pensive bosom of the silver effulgence. Flapdoodle to feed fools on. They could easily have big establishments whole thing quite painless out of all the taxes give every child born five quid at compound interest up to twentyone five per cent is a hundred shillings and five tiresome pounds multiply by twenty decimal system encourage people to put by money save hundred and ten and a bit twentyone years want to work it out on paper come to a tidy sum more than you think.
Not stillborn of course. They are not even registered. Trouble for nothing.
Funny sight two of them together, their bellies out. Molly and Mrs Moisel. Mothers' meeting. Phthisis retires for the time being, then returns. How flat they look all of a sudden after. Peaceful eyes. Weight off their mind. Old Mrs Thornton was a jolly old soul. All my babies, she said. The spoon of pap in her mouth before she fed them. O, that's nyumnyum. Got her hand crushed by old Tom Wall's son. His first bow to the public. Head like a prize pumpkin. Snuffy Dr Murren. People knocking them up at all hours. For God' sake, doctor. Wife in her throes. Then keep them waiting months for their fee. To attendance on your wife. No gratitude in people. Humane doctors, most of them.
Before the huge high door of the Irish house of parliament a flock of pigeons flew. Their little frolic after meals. Who will we do it on? I pick the fellow in black. Here goes. Here's good luck. Must be thrilling from the air. Apjohn, myself and Owen Goldberg up in the trees near Goose green playing the monkeys. Mackerel they called me.
A squad of constables debouched from College street, marching in Indian file. Goosestep. Foodheated faces, sweating helmets, patting their truncheons. After their feed with a good load of fat soup under their belts. Policeman's lot is oft a happy one. They split up in groups and scattered, saluting, towards their beats. Let out to graze. Best moment to attack one in pudding time. A punch in his dinner. A squad of others, marching irregularly, rounded Trinity railings making for the station. Bound for their troughs. Prepare to receive cavalry. Prepare to receive soup.
He crossed under Tommy Moore's roguish finger. They did right to put him up over a urinal: meeting of the waters. Ought to be places for women. Running into cakeshops. Settle my hat straight. There is not in this wide world a vallee. Great song of Julia Morkan's. Kept her voice up to the very last. Pupil of Michael Balfe's, wasn't she?
He gazed after the last broad tunic. Nasty customers to tackle. Jack Power could a tale unfold: father a G man. If a fellow gave them trouble being lagged they let him have it hot and heavy in the bridewell. Can't blame them after all with the job they have especially the young hornies. That horsepoliceman the day Joe Chamberlain was given his degree in Trinity he got a run for his money. My word he did! His horse's hoofs clattering after us down Abbey street. Lucky I had the presence of mind to dive into Manning's or I was souped. He did come a wallop, by George. Must have cracked his skull on the cobblestones. I oughtn't to have got myself swept along with those medicals. And the Trinity jibs in their mortarboards. Looking for trouble. Still I got to know that young Dixon who dressed that sting for me in the Mater and now he's in Holles street where Mrs Purefoy. Wheels within wheels. Police whistle in my ears still. All skedaddled. Why he fixed on me. Give me in charge. Right here it began.
—Up the Boers!
—Three cheers for De Wet!
—We'll hang Joe Chamberlain on a sourapple tree.
Silly billies: mob of young cubs yelling their guts out. Vinegar hill. The Butter exchange band. Few years' time half of them magistrates and civil servants. War comes on: into the army helterskelter: same fellows used to. Whether on the scaffold high.
Never know who you're talking to. Corny Kelleher he has Harvey Duff in his eye. Like that Peter or Denis or James Carey that blew the gaff on the invincibles. Member of the corporation too. Egging raw youths on to get in the know all the time drawing secret service pay from the castle. Drop him like a hot potato. Why those plainclothes men are always courting slaveys. Easily twig a man used to uniform. Squarepushing up against a backdoor. Maul her a bit. Then the next thing on the menu. And who is the gentleman does be visiting there? Was the young master saying anything? Peeping Tom through the keyhole. Decoy duck. Hotblooded young student fooling round her fat arms ironing.
—Are those yours, Mary?
—I don't wear such things... Stop or I'll tell the missus on you. Out half the night.
—There are great times coming, Mary. Wait till you see.
—Ah, gelong with your great times coming.
Barmaids too. Tobaccoshopgirls.
James Stephens' idea was the best. He knew them. Circles of ten so that a fellow couldn't round on more than his own ring. Sinn Fein. Back out you get the knife. Hidden hand. Stay in. The firing squad. Turnkey's daughter got him out of Richmond, off from Lusk. Putting up in the Buckingham Palace hotel under their very noses. Garibaldi.
You must have a certain fascination: Parnell. Arthur Griffith is a squareheaded fellow but he has no go in him for the mob. Or gas about our lovely land. Gammon and spinach. Dublin Bakery Company's tearoom. Debating societies. That republicanism is the best form of government. That the language question should take precedence of the economic question. Have your daughters inveigling them to your house. Stuff them up with meat and drink. Michaelmas goose. Here's a good lump of thyme seasoning under the apron for you. Have another quart of goosegrease before it gets too cold. Halffed enthusiasts. Penny roll and a walk with the band. No grace for the carver. The thought that the other chap pays best sauce in the world. Make themselves thoroughly at home. Show us over those apricots, meaning peaches. The not far distant day. Homerule sun rising up in the northwest.
His smile faded as he walked, a heavy cloud hiding the sun slowly, shadowing Trinity's surly front. Trams passed one another, ingoing, outgoing, clanging. Useless words. Things go on same, day after day: squads of police marching out, back: trams in, out. Those two loonies mooching about. Dignam carted off. Mina Purefoy swollen belly on a bed groaning to have a child tugged out of her. One born every second somewhere. Other dying every second. Since I fed the birds five minutes. Three hundred kicked the bucket. Other three hundred born, washing the blood off, all are washed in the blood of the lamb, bawling maaaaaa.
Cityful passing away, other cityful coming, passing away too: other coming on, passing on. Houses, lines of houses, streets, miles of pavements, piledup bricks, stones. Changing hands. This owner, that. Landlord never dies they say. Other steps into his shoes when he gets his notice to quit. They buy the place up with gold and still they have all the gold. Swindle in it somewhere. Piled up in cities, worn away age after age. Pyramids in sand. Built on bread and onions. Slaves Chinese wall. Babylon. Big stones left. Round towers. Rest rubble, sprawling suburbs, jerrybuilt. Kerwan's mushroom houses built of breeze. Shelter, for the night.
No-one is anything.
This is the very worst hour of the day. Vitality. Dull, gloomy: hate this hour. Feel as if I had been eaten and spewed.
Provost's house. The reverend Dr Salmon: tinned salmon. Well tinned in there. Like a mortuary chapel. Wouldn't live in it if they paid me. Hope they have liver and bacon today. Nature abhors a vacuum.
The sun freed itself slowly and lit glints of light among the silverware opposite in Walter Sexton's window by which John Howard Parnell passed, unseeing.
There he is: the brother. Image of him. Haunting face. Now that's a coincidence. Course hundreds of times you think of a person and don't meet him. Like a man walking in his sleep. No-one knows him. Must be a corporation meeting today. They say he never put on the city marshal's uniform since he got the job. Charley Kavanagh used to come out on his high horse, cocked hat, puffed, powdered and shaved. Look at the woebegone walk of him. Eaten a bad egg. Poached eyes on ghost. I have a pain. Great man's brother: his brother's brother. He'd look nice on the city charger. Drop into the D.B.C. probably for his coffee, play chess there. His brother used men as pawns. Let them all go to pot. Afraid to pass a remark on him. Freeze them up with that eye of his. That's the fascination: the name. All a bit touched. Mad Fanny and his other sister Mrs Dickinson driving about with scarlet harness. Bolt upright lik surgeon M'Ardle. Still David Sheehy beat him for south Meath. Apply for the Chiltern Hundreds and retire into public life. The patriot's banquet. Eating orangepeels in the park. Simon Dedalus said when they put him in parliament that Parnell would come back from the grave and lead him out of the house of commons by the arm.
—Of the twoheaded octopus, one of whose heads is the head upon which the ends of the world have forgotten to come while the other speaks with a Scotch accent. The tentacles...
They passed from behind Mr Bloom along the curbstone. Beard and bicycle. Young woman.
And there he is too. Now that's really a coincidence: second time. Coming events cast their shadows before. With the approval of the eminent poet, Mr Geo. Russell. That might be Lizzie Twigg with him. A. E.: what does that mean? Initials perhaps. Albert Edward, Arthur Edmund, Alphonsus Eb Ed El Esquire. What was he saying? The ends of the world with a Scotch accent. Tentacles: octopus. Something occult: symbolism. Holding forth. She's taking it all in. Not saying a word. To aid gentleman in literary work.
His eyes followed the high figure in homespun, beard and bicycle, a listening woman at his side. Coming from the vegetarian. Only weggebobbles and fruit. Don't eat a beefsteak. If you do the eyes of that cow will pursue you through all eternity. They say it's healthier. Windandwatery though. Tried it. Keep you on the run all day. Bad as a bloater. Dreams all night. Why do they call that thing they gave me nutsteak? Nutarians. Fruitarians. To give you the idea you are eating rumpsteak. Absurd. Salty too. They cook in soda. Keep you sitting by the tap all night.
Her stockings are loose over her ankles. I detest that: so tasteless. Those literary etherial people they are all. Dreamy, cloudy, symbolistic. Esthetes they are. I wouldn't be surprised if it was that kind of food you see produces the like waves of the brain the poetical. For example one of those policemen sweating Irish stew into their shirts you couldn't squeeze a line of poetry out of him. Don't know what poetry is even. Must be in a certain mood.
The dreamy cloudy gull
Waves o'er the waters dull.
He crossed at Nassau street corner and stood before the window of Yeates and Son, pricing the fieldglasses. Or will I drop into old Harris's and have a chat with young Sinclair? Wellmannered fellow. Probably at his lunch. Must get those old glasses of mine set right. Goerz lenses six guineas. Germans making their way everywhere. Sell on easy terms to capture trade. Undercutting. Might chance on a pair in the railway lost property office. Astonishing the things people leave behind them in trains and cloakrooms. What do they be thinking about? Women too. Incredible. Last year travelling to Ennis had to pick up that farmer's daughter's ba and hand it to her at Limerick junction. Unclaimed money too. There's a little watch up there on the roof of the bank to test those glasses by.
His lids came down on the lower rims of his irides. Can't see it. If you imagine it's there you can almost see it. Can't see it.
He faced about and, standing between the awnings, held out his right hand at arm's length towards the sun. Wanted to try that often. Yes: completely. The tip of his little finger blotted out the sun's disk. Must be the focus where the rays cross. If I had black glasses. Interesting. There was a lot of talk about those sunspots when we were in Lombard street west. Looking up from the back garden. Terrific explosions they are. There will be a total eclipse this year: autumn some time.
Now that I come to think of it that ball falls at Greenwich time. It's the clock is worked by an electric wire from Dunsink. Must go out there some first Saturday of the month. If I could get an introduction to professor Joly or learn up something about his family. That would do to: man always feels complimented. Flattery where least expected. Nobleman proud to be descended from some king's mistress. His foremother. Lay it on with a trowel. Cap in hand goes through the land. Not go in and blurt out what you know you're not to: what's parallax? Show this gentleman the door.
Ah.
His hand fell to his side again.
Never know anything about it. Waste of time. Gasballs spinning about, crossing each other, passing. Same old dingdong always. Gas: then solid: then world: then cold: then dead shell drifting around, frozen rock, like that pineapple rock. The moon. Must be a new moon out, she said. I believe there is.
He went on by la maison Claire.
Wait. The full moon was the night we were Sunday fortnight exactly there is a new moon. Walking down by the Tolka. Not bad for a Fairview moon. She was humming. The young May moon she's beaming, love. He other side of her. Elbow, arm. He. Glowworm's la-amp is gleaming, love. Touch. Fingers. Asking. Answer. Yes.
Stop. Stop. If it was it was. Must.
Mr Bloom, quickbreathing, slowlier walking passed Adam court.
With a keep quiet relief his eyes took note this is the street here middle of the day of Bob Doran's bottle shoulders. On his annual bend, M Coy said. They drink in order to say or do something or cherchez la femme. Up in the Coombe with chummies and streetwalkers and then the rest of the year sober as a judge.
Yes. Thought so. Sloping into the Empire. Gone. Plain soda would do him good. Where Pat Kinsella had his Harp theatre before Whitbred ran the Queen's. Broth of a boy. Dion Boucicault business with his harvestmoon face in a poky bonnet. Three Purty Maids from School. How time flies, eh? Showing long red pantaloons under his skirts. Drinkers, drinking, laughed spluttering, their drink against their breath. More power, Pat. Coarse red: fun for drunkards: guffaw and smoke. Take off that white hat. His parboiled eyes. Where is he now? Beggar somewhere. The harp that once did starve us all.
I was happier then. Or was that I? Or am I now I? Twentyeight I was. She twentythree. When we left Lombard street west something changed. Could never like it again after Rudy. Can't bring back time. Like holding water in your hand. Would you go back to then? Just beginning then. Would you? Are you not happy in your home you poor little naughty boy? Wants to sew on buttons for me. I must answer. Write it in the library.
Grafton street gay with housed awnings lured his senses. Muslin prints, silkdames and dowagers, jingle of harnesses, hoofthuds lowringing in the baking causeway. Thick feet that woman has in the white stockings. Hope the rain mucks them up on her. Countrybred chawbacon. All the beef to the heels were in. Always gives a woman clumsy feet. Molly looks out of plumb.
He passed, dallying, the windows of Brown Thomas, silk mercers. Cascades of ribbons. Flimsy China silks. A tilted urn poured from its mouth a flood of bloodhued poplin: lustrous blood. The huguenots brought that here. La causa è santa! Tara tara. Great chorus that. Taree tara. Must be washed in rainwater. Meyerbeer. Tara: bom bom bom.
Pincushions. I'm a long time threatening to buy one. Sticking them all over the place. Needles in window curtains.
He bared slightly his left forearm. Scrape: nearly gone. Not today anyhow. Must go back for that lotion. For her birthday perhaps. Junejulyaugseptember eighth. Nearly three months off. Then she mightn't like it. Women won't pick up pins. Say it cuts lo.
Gleaming silks, petticoats on slim brass rails, rays of flat silk stockings.
Useless to go back. Had to be. Tell me all.
High voices. Sunwarm silk. Jingling harnesses. All for a woman, home and houses, silkwebs, silver, rich fruits spicy from Jaffa. Agendath Netaim. Wealth of the world.
A warm human plumpness settled down on his brain. His brain yielded. Perfume of embraces all him assailed. With hungered flesh obscurely, he mutely craved to adore.
Duke street. Here we are. Must eat. The Burton. Feel better then.
He turned Combridge's corner, still pursued. Jingling, hoofthuds. Perfumed bodies, warm, full. All kissed, yielded: in deep summer fields, tangled pressed grass, in trickling hallways of tenements, along sofas, creaking beds.
—Jack, love!
—Darling!
—Kiss me, Reggy!
—My boy!
—Love!
His heart astir he pushed in the door of the Burton restaurant. Stink gripped his trembling breath: pungent meatjuice, slush of greens. See the animals feed.
Men, men, men.
Perched on high stools by the bar, hats shoved back, at the tables calling for more bread no charge, swilling, wolfing gobfuls of sloppy food, their eyes bulging, wiping wetted moustaches. A pallid suetfaced young man polished his tumbler knife fork and spoon with his napkin. New set of microbes. A man with an infant's saucestained napkin tucked round him shovelled gurgling soup down his gullet. A man spitting back on his plate: halfmasticated gristle: gums: no teeth to chewchewchew it. Chump chop from the grill. Bolting to get it over. Sad booser's eyes. Bitten off more than he can chew. Am I like that? See ourselves as others see us. Hungry man is an angry man. Working tooth and jaw. Don't! O! A bone! That last pagan king of Ireland Cormac in the schoolpoem choked himself at Sletty southward of the Boyne. Wonder what he was eating. Something galoptious. Saint Patrick converted him to Christianity. Couldn't swallow it all however.
—Roast beef and cabbage.
—One stew.
Smells of men. His gorge rose. Spaton sawdust, sweetish warmish cigarette smoke, reek of plug, spilt beer, men's beery piss, the stale of ferment.
Couldn't eat a morsel here. Fellow sharpening knife and fork to eat all before him, old chap picking his tootles. Slight spasm, full, chewing the cud. Before and after. Grace after meals. Look on this picture then on that. Scoffing up stewgravy with sopping sippets of bread. Lick it off the plate, man! Get out of this.
He gazed round the stooled and tabled eaters, tightening the wings of his nose.
—Two stouts here.
—One corned and cabbage.
That fellow ramming a knifeful of cabbage down as if his life depended on it. Good stroke. Give me the fidgets to look. Safer to eat from his three hands. Tear it limb from limb. Second nature to him. Born with a silver knife in his mouth. That's witty, I think. Or no. Silver means born rich. Born with a knife. But then the allusion is lost.
An illgirt server gathered sticky clattering plates. Rock, the head bailiff, standing at the bar blew the foamy crown from his tankard. Well up: it splashed yellow near his boot. A diner, knife and fork upright, elbows on table, ready for a second helping stared towards the foodlift across his stained square of newspaper. Other chap telling him something with his mouth full. Sympathetic listener. Table talk. I munched hum un thu Unchster Bunk un Munchday. Ha? Did you, faith?
Mr Bloom raised two fingers doubtfully to his lips. His eyes said:
—Not here. Don't see him.
Out. I hate dirty eaters.
He backed towards the door. Get a light snack in Davy Byrne's. Stopgap. Keep me going. Had a good breakfast.
—Roast and mashed here.
—Pint of stout.
Every fellow for his own, tooth and nail. Gulp. Grub. Gulp. Gobstuff.
He came out into clearer air and turned back towards Grafton street. Eat or be eaten. Kill! Kill!
Suppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. All trotting down with porringers and tommycans to be filled. Devour contents in the street. John Howard Parnell example the provost of Trinity every mother's son don't talk of your provosts and provost of Trinity women and children cabmen priests parsons fieldmarshals archbishops. From Ailesbury road, Clyde road, artisans' dwellings, north Dublin union, lord mayor in his gingerbread coach, old queen in a bathchair. My plate's empty. After you with our incorporated drinkingcup. Like sir Philip Crampton's fountain. Rub off the microbes with your handkerchief. Next chap rubs on a new batch with his. Father O'Flynn would make hares of them all. Have rows all the same. All for number one. Children fighting for the scrapings of the pot. Want a souppot as big as the Phoenix park. Harpooning flitches and hindquarters out of it. Hate people all round you. City Arms hotel table d'hôte she called it. Soup, joint and sweet. Never know whose thoughts you're chewing. Then who'd wash up all the plates and forks? Might be all feeding on tabloids that time. Teeth getting worse and worse.
After all there's a lot in that vegetarian fine flavour of things from the earth garlic of course it stinks after Italian organgrinders crisp of onions mushrooms truffles. Pain to the animal too. Pluck and draw fowl. Wretched brutes there at the cattlemarket waiting for the poleaxe to split their skulls open. Moo. Poor trembling calves. Meh. Staggering bob. Bubble and squeak. Butchers' buckets wobbly lights. Give us that brisket off the hook. Plup. Rawhead and bloody bones. Flayed glasseyed sheep hung from their haunches, sheepsnouts bloodypapered snivelling nosejam on sawdust. Top and lashers going out. Don't maul them pieces, young one.
Hot fresh blood they prescribe for decline. Blood always needed. Insidious. Lick it up smokinghot, thick sugary. Famished ghosts.
Ah, I'm hungry.
He entered Davy Byrne's. Moral pub. He doesn't chat. Stands a drink now and then. But in leapyear once in four. Cashed a cheque for me once.
What will I take now? He drew his watch. Let me see now. Shandygaff?
—Hello, Bloom, Nosey Flynn said from his nook.
—Hello, Flynn.
—How's things?
—Tiptop... Let me see. I'll take a glass of burgundy and... let me see.
Sardines on the shelves. Almost taste them by looking. Sandwich? Ham and his descendants musterred and bred there. Potted meats. What is home without Plumtree's potted meat? Incomplete. What a stupid ad! Under the obituary notices they stuck it. All up a plumtree. Dignam's potted meat. Cannibals would with lemon and rice. White missionary too salty. Like pickled pork. Expect the chief consumes the parts of honour. Ought to be tough from exercise. His wives in a row to watch the effect. There was a right royal old nigger. Who ate or something the somethings of the reverend Mr MacTrigger. With it an abode of bliss. Lord knows what concoction. Cauls mouldy tripes windpipes faked and minced up. Puzzle find the meat. Kosher. No meat and milk together. Hygiene that was what they call now. Yom Kippur fast spring cleaning of inside. Peace and war depend on some fellow's digestion. Religions. Christmas turkeys and geese. Slaughter of innocents. Eat drink and be merry. Then casual wards full after. Heads bandaged. Cheese digests all but itself. Mity cheese.
—Have you a cheese sandwich?
—Yes, sir.
Like a few olives too if they had them. Italian I prefer. Good glass of burgundy take away that. Lubricate. A nice salad, cool as a cucumber, Tom Kernan can dress. Puts gusto into it. Pure olive oil. Milly served me that cutlet with a sprig of parsley. Take one Spanish onion. God made food, the devil the cooks. Devilled crab.
—Wife well?
—Quite well, thanks... A cheese sandwich, then. Gorgonzola, have you?
—Yes, sir.
Nosey Flynn sipped his grog.
—Doing any singing those times?
Look at his mouth. Could whistle in his own ear. Flap ears to match. Music. Knows as much about it as my coachman. Still better tell him. Does no harm. Free ad.
—She's engaged for a big tour end of this month. You may have heard perhaps.
—No. O, that's the style. Who's getting it up?
The curate served.
—How much is that?
—Seven d., sir... Thank you, sir.
Mr Bloom cut his sandwich into slender strips. Mr MacTrigger. Easier than the dreamy creamy stuff. His five hundred wives. Had the time of their lives.
—Mustard, sir?
—Thank you.
He studded under each lifted strip yellow blobs. Their lives. I have it. It grew bigger and bigger and bigger.
—Getting it up? he said. Well, it's like a company idea, you see. Part shares and part profits.
—Ay, now I remember, Nosey Flynn said, putting his hand in his pocket to scratch his groin. Who is this was telling me? Isn't Blazes Boylan mixed up in it?
A warm shock of air heat of mustard hanched on Mr Bloom's heart. He raised his eyes and met the stare of a bilious clock. Two. Pub clock five minutes fast. Time going on. Hands moving. Two. Not yet.
His midriff yearned then upward, sank within him, yearned more longly, longingly.
Wine.
He smellsipped the cordial juice and, bidding his throat strongly to speed it, set his wineglass delicately down.
—Yes, he said. He's the organiser in point of fact.
No fear: no brains.
Nosey Flynn snuffled and scratched. Flea having a good square meal.
—He had a good slice of luck, Jack Mooney was telling me, over that boxingmatch Myler Keogh won again that soldier in the Portobello barracks. By God, he had the little kipper down in the county Carlow he was telling me...
Hope that dewdrop doesn't come down into his glass. No, snuffled it up.
—For near a month, man, before it came off. Sucking duck eggs by God till further orders. Keep him off the boose, see? O, by God, Blazes is a hairy chap.
Davy Byrne came forward from the hindbar in tuckstitched shirtsleeves, cleaning his lips with two wipes of his napkin. Herring's blush. Whose smile upon each feature plays with such and such replete. Too much fat on the parsnips.
—And here's himself and pepper on him, Nosey Flynn said. Can you give us a good one for the Gold cup?
—I'm off that, Mr Flynn, Davy Byrne answered. I never put anything on a horse.
—You're right there, Nosey Flynn said.
Mr Bloom ate his strips of sandwich, fresh clean bread, with relish of disgust pungent mustard, the feety savour of green cheese. Sips of his wine soothed his palate. Not logwood that. Tastes fuller this weather with the chill off.
Nice quiet bar. Nice piece of wood in that counter. Nicely planed. Like the way it curves there.
—I wouldn't do anything at all in that line, Davy Byrne said. It ruined many a man, the same horses.
Vintners' sweepstake. Licensed for the sale of beer, wine and spirits for consumption on the premises. Heads I win tails you lose.
—True for you, Nosey Flynn said. Unless you're in the know. There's no straight sport going now. Lenehan gets some good ones. He's giving Sceptre today. Zinfandel's the favourite, lord Howard de Walden's, won at Epsom. Morny Cannon is riding him. I could have got seven to one against Saint Amant a fortnight before.
—That so? Davy Byrne said...
He went towards the window and, taking up the pettycash book, scanned its pages.
—I could, faith, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling. That was a rare bit of horseflesh. Saint Frusquin was her sire. She won in a thunderstorm, Rothschild's filly, with wadding in her ears. Blue jacket and yellow cap. Bad luck to big Ben Dollard and his John O'Gaunt. He put me off it. Ay.
He drank resignedly from his tumbler, running his fingers down the flutes.
—Ay, he said, sighing.
Mr Bloom, champing, standing, looked upon his sigh. Nosey numbskull. Will I tell him that horse Lenehan? He knows already. Better let him forget. Go and lose more. Fool and his money. Dewdrop coming down again. Cold nose he'd have kissing a woman. Still they might like. Prickly beards they like. Dogs' cold noses. Old Mrs Riordan with the rumbling stomach's Skye terrier in the City Arms hotel. Molly fondling him in her lap. O, the big doggybowwowsywowsy!
Wine soaked and softened rolled pith of bread mustard a moment mawkish cheese. Nice wine it is. Taste it better because I'm not thirsty. Bath of course does that. Just a bite or two. Then about six o'clock I can. Six. Six. Time will be gone then. She...
Mild fire of wine kindled his veins. I wanted that badly. Felt so off colour. His eyes unhungrily saw shelves of tins: sardines, gaudy lobsters' claws. All the odd things people pick up for food. Out of shells, periwinkles with a pin, off trees, snails out of the ground the French eat, out of the sea with bait on a hook. Silly fish learn nothing in a thousand years. If you didn't know risky putting anything into your mouth. Poisonous berries. Johnny Magories. Roundness you think good. Gaudy colour warns you off. One fellow told another and so on. Try it on the dog first. Led on by the smell or the look. Tempting fruit. Ice cones. Cream. Instinct. Orangegroves for instance. Need artificial irrigation. Bleibtreustrasse. Yes but what about oysters. Unsightly like a clot of phlegm. Filthy shells. Devil to open them too. Who found them out? Garbage, sewage they feed on. Fizz and Red bank oysters. Effect on the sexual. Aphrodis. He was in the Red Bank this morning. Was he oysters old fish at table perhaps he young flesh in bed no June has no ar no oysters. But there are people like things high. Tainted game. Jugged hare. First catch your hare. Chinese eating eggs fifty years old, blue and green again. Dinner of thirty courses. Each dish harmless might mix inside. Idea for a poison mystery. That archduke Leopold was it no yes or was it Otto one of those Habsburgs? Or who was it used to eat the scruff off his own head? Cheapest lunch in town. Of course aristocrats, then the others copy to be in the fashion. Milly too rock oil and flour. Raw pastry I like myself. Half the catch of oysters they throw back in the sea to keep up the price. Cheap no-one would buy. Caviare. Do the grand. Hock in green glasses. Swell blowout. Lady this. Powdered bosom pearls. The élite. Crème de la crème. They want special dishes to pretend they're. Hermit with a platter of pulse keep down the stings of the flesh. Know me come eat with me. Royal sturgeon high sheriff, Coffey, the butcher, right to venisons of the forest from his ex. Send him back the half of a cow. Spread I saw down in the Master of the Rolls' kitchen area. Whitehatted chef like a rabbi. Combustible duck. Curly cabbage à la duchesse de Parme. Just as well to write it on the bill of fare so you can know what you've eaten. Too many drugs spoil the broth. I know it myself. Dosing it with Edwards' desiccated soup. Geese stuffed silly for them. Lobsters boiled alive. Do ptake some ptarmigan. Wouldn't mind being a waiter in a swell hotel. Tips, evening dress, halfnaked ladies. May I tempt you to a little more filleted lemon sole, miss Dubedat? Yes, do bedad. And she did bedad. Huguenot name I expect that. A miss Dubedat lived in Killiney, I remember. Du, de la French. Still it's the same fish perhaps old Micky Hanlon of Moore street ripped the guts out of making money hand over fist finger in fishes' gills can't write his name on a cheque think he was painting the landscape with his mouth twisted. Moooikill A Aitcha Ha ignorant as a kish of brogues, worth fifty thousand pounds.
Stuck on the pane two flies buzzed, stuck.
Glowing wine on his palate lingered swallowed. Crushing in the winepress grapes of Burgundy. Sun's heat it is. Seems to a secret touch telling me memory. Touched his sense moistened remembered. Hidden under wild ferns on Howth below us bay sleeping: sky. No sound. The sky. The bay purple by the Lion's head. Green by Drumleck. Yellowgreen towards Sutton. Fields of undersea, the lines faint brown in grass, buried cities. Pillowed on my coat she had her hair, earwigs in the heather scrub my hand under her nape, you'll toss me all. O wonder! Coolsoft with ointments her hand touched me, caressed: her eyes upon me did not turn away. Ravished over her I lay, full lips full open, kissed her mouth. Yum. Softly she gave me in my mouth the seedcake warm and chewed. Mawkish pulp her mouth had mumbled sweetsour of her spittle. Joy: I ate it: joy. Young life, her lips that gave me pouting. Soft warm sticky gumjelly lips. Flowers her eyes were, take me, willing eyes. Pebbles fell. She lay still. A goat. No-one. High on Ben Howth rhododendrons a nannygoat walking surefooted, dropping currants. Screened under ferns she laughed warmfolded. Wildly I lay on her, kissed her: eyes, her lips, her stretched neck beating, woman's breasts full in her blouse of nun's veiling, fat nipples upright. Hot I tongued her. She kissed me. I was kissed. All yielding she tossed my hair. Kissed, she kissed me.
Me. And me now.
Stuck, the flies buzzed.
His downcast eyes followed the silent veining of the oaken slab. Beauty: it curves: curves are beauty. Shapely goddesses, Venus, Juno: curves the world admires. Can see them library museum standing in the round hall, naked goddesses. Aids to digestion. They don't care what man looks. All to see. Never speaking. I mean to say to fellows like Flynn. Suppose she did Pygmalion and Galatea what would she say first? Mortal! Put you in your proper place. Quaffing nectar at mess with gods golden dishes, all ambrosial. Not like a tanner lunch we have, boiled mutton, carrots and turnips, bottle of Allsop. Nectar imagine it drinking electricity: gods' food. Lovely forms of women sculped Junonian. Immortal lovely. And we stuffing food in one hole and out behind: food, chyle, blood, dung, earth, food: have to feed it like stoking an engine. They have no. Never looked. I'll look today. Keeper won't see. Bend down let something drop see if she.
Dribbling a quiet message from his bladder came to go to do not to do there to do. A man and ready he drained his glass to the lees and walked, to men too they gave themselves, manly conscious, lay with men lovers, a youth enjoyed her, to the yard.
When the sound of his boots had ceased Davy Byrne said from his book:
—What is this he is? Isn't he in the insurance line?
—He's out of that long ago, Nosey Flynn said. He does canvassing for the Freeman.
—I know him well to see, Davy Byrne said. Is he in trouble?
—Trouble? Nosey Flynn said. Not that I heard of. Why?
—I noticed he was in mourning.
—Was he? Nosey Flynn said. So he was, faith. I asked him how was all at home. You're right, by God. So he was.
—I never broach the subject, Davy Byrne said humanely, if I see a gentleman is in trouble that way. It only brings it up fresh in their minds.
—It's not the wife anyhow, Nosey Flynn said. I met him the day before yesterday and he coming out of that Irish farm dairy John Wyse Nolan's wife has in Henry street with a jar of cream in his hand taking it home to his better half. She's well nourished, I tell you. Plovers on toast.
—And is he doing for the Freeman? Davy Byrne said.
Nosey Flynn pursed his lips.
—-He doesn't buy cream on the ads he picks up. You can make bacon of that.
—How so? Davy Byrne asked, coming from his book.
Nosey Flynn made swift passes in the air with juggling fingers. He winked.
—He's in the craft, he said.
—-Do you tell me so? Davy Byrne said.
—Very much so, Nosey Flynn said. Ancient free and accepted order. He's an excellent brother. Light, life and love, by God. They give him a leg up. I was told that by a—well, I won't say who.
—Is that a fact?
—O, it's a fine order, Nosey Flynn said. They stick to you when you're down. I know a fellow was trying to get into it. But they're as close as damn it. By God they did right to keep the women out of it.
Davy Byrne smiledyawnednodded all in one:
—Iiiiiichaaaaaaach!
—There was one woman, Nosey Flynn said, hid herself in a clock to find out what they do be doing. But be damned but they smelt her out and swore her in on the spot a master mason. That was one of the saint Legers of Doneraile.
Davy Byrne, sated after his yawn, said with tearwashed eyes:
—And is that a fact? Decent quiet man he is. I often saw him in here and I never once saw him—you know, over the line.
—God Almighty couldn't make him drunk, Nosey Flynn said firmly. Slips off when the fun gets too hot. Didn't you see him look at his watch? Ah, you weren't there. If you ask him to have a drink first thing he does he outs with the watch to see what he ought to imbibe. Declare to God he does.
—There are some like that, Davy Byrne said. He's a safe man, I'd say.
—He's not too bad, Nosey Flynn said, snuffling it up. He's been known to put his hand down too to help a fellow. Give the devil his due. O, Bloom has his good points. But there's one thing he'll never do.
His hand scrawled a dry pen signature beside his grog.
—I know, Davy Byrne said.
—Nothing in black and white, Nosey Flynn said.
Paddy Leonard and Bantam Lyons came in. Tom Rochford followed frowning, a plaining hand on his claret waistcoat.
—Day, Mr Byrne.
—Day, gentlemen.
They paused at the counter.
—Who's standing? Paddy Leonard asked.
—I'm sitting anyhow, Nosey Flynn answered.
—Well, what'll it be? Paddy Leonard asked.
—I'll take a stone ginger, Bantam Lyons said.
—How much? Paddy Leonard cried. Since when, for God' sake? What's yours, Tom?
—How is the main drainage? Nosey Flynn asked, sipping.
For answer Tom Rochford pressed his hand to his breastbone and hiccupped.
—Would I trouble you for a glass of fresh water, Mr Byrne? he said.
—Certainly, sir.
Paddy Leonard eyed his alemates.
—Lord love a duck, he said. Look at what I'm standing drinks to! Cold water and gingerpop! Two fellows that would suck whisky off a sore leg. He has some bloody horse up his sleeve for the Gold cup. A dead snip.
—Zinfandel is it? Nosey Flynn asked.
Tom Rochford spilt powder from a twisted paper into the water set before him.
—That cursed dyspepsia, he said before drinking.
—Breadsoda is very good, Davy Byrne said.
Tom Rochford nodded and drank.
—Is it Zinfandel?
—Say nothing! Bantam Lyons winked. I'm going to plunge five bob on my own.
—Tell us if you're worth your salt and be damned to you, Paddy Leonard said. Who gave it to you?
Mr Bloom on his way out raised three fingers in greeting.
—So long! Nosey Flynn said.
The others turned.
—That's the man now that gave it to me, Bantam Lyons whispered.
—Prrwht! Paddy Leonard said with scorn. Mr Byrne, sir, we'll take two of your small Jamesons after that and a...
—Stone ginger, Davy Byrne added civilly.
—Ay, Paddy Leonard said. A suckingbottle for the baby.
Mr Bloom walked towards Dawson street, his tongue brushing his teeth smooth. Something green it would have to be: spinach, say. Then with those Rontgen rays searchlight you could.
At Duke lane a ravenous terrier choked up a sick knuckly cud on the cobblestones and lapped it with new zest. Surfeit. Returned with thanks having fully digested the contents. First sweet then savoury. Mr Bloom coasted warily. Ruminants. His second course. Their upper jaw they move. Wonder if Tom Rochford will do anything with that invention of his? Wasting time explaining it to Flynn's mouth. Lean people long mouths. Ought to be a hall or a place where inventors could go in and invent free. Course then you'd have all the cranks pestering.
He hummed, prolonging in solemn echo the closes of the bars:
Don Giovanni, a cenar teco M'invitasti.
Feel better. Burgundy. Good pick me up. Who distilled first? Some chap in the blues. Dutch courage. That Kilkenny People in the national library now I must.
Bare clean closestools waiting in the window of William Miller, plumber, turned back his thoughts. They could: and watch it all the way down, swallow a pin sometimes come out of the ribs years after, tour round the body changing biliary duct spleen squirting liver gastric juice coils of intestines like pipes. But the poor buffer would have to stand all the time with his insides entrails on show. Science.
—A cenar teco.
What does that teco mean? Tonight perhaps.
Don Giovanni, thou hast me invited
To come to supper tonight,
The rum the rumdum.
Doesn't go properly.
Keyes: two months if I get Nannetti to. That'll be two pounds ten about two pounds eight. Three Hynes owes me. Two eleven. Prescott's dyeworks van over there. If I get Billy Prescott's ad: two fifteen. Five guineas about. On the pig's back.
Could buy one of those silk petticoats for Molly, colour of her new garters.
Today. Today. Not think.
Tour the south then. What about English wateringplaces? Brighton, Margate. Piers by moonlight. Her voice floating out. Those lovely seaside girls. Against John Long's a drowsing loafer lounged in heavy thought, gnawing a crusted knuckle. Handy man wants job. Small wages. Will eat anything.
Mr Bloom turned at Gray's confectioner's window of unbought tarts and passed the reverend Thomas Connellan's bookstore. Why I left the church of Rome? Birds' Nest. Women run him. They say they used to give pauper children soup to change to protestants in the time of the potato blight. Society over the way papa went to for the conversion of poor jews. Same bait. Why we left the church of Rome.
A blind stripling stood tapping the curbstone with his slender cane. No tram in sight. Wants to cross.
—Do you want to cross? Mr Bloom asked.
The blind stripling did not answer. His wallface frowned weakly. He moved his head uncertainly.
—You're in Dawson street, Mr Bloom said. Molesworth street is opposite. Do you want to cross? There's nothing in the way.
The cane moved out trembling to the left. Mr Bloom's eye followed its line and saw again the dyeworks' van drawn up before Drago's. Where I saw his brillantined hair just when I was. Horse drooping. Driver in John Long's. Slaking his drouth.
—There's a van there, Mr Bloom said, but it's not moving. I'll see you across. Do you want to go to Molesworth street?
—Yes, the stripling answered. South Frederick street.
—Come, Mr Bloom said.
He touched the thin elbow gently: then took the limp seeing hand to guide it forward.
Say something to him. Better not do the condescending. They mistrust what you tell them. Pass a common remark.
—The rain kept off.
No answer.
Stains on his coat. Slobbers his food, I suppose. Tastes all different for him. Have to be spoonfed first. Like a child's hand, his hand. Like Milly's was. Sensitive. Sizing me up I daresay from my hand. Wonder if he has a name. Van. Keep his cane clear of the horse's legs: tired drudge get his doze. That's right. Clear. Behind a bull: in front of a horse.
—Thanks, sir.
Knows I'm a man. Voice.
—Right now? First turn to the left.
The blind stripling tapped the curbstone and went on his way, drawing his cane back, feeling again.
Mr Bloom walked behind the eyeless feet, a flatcut suit of herringbone tweed. Poor young fellow! How on earth did he know that van was there? Must have felt it. See things in their forehead perhaps: kind of sense of volume. Weight or size of it, something blacker than the dark. Wonder would he feel it if something was removed. Feel a gap. Queer idea of Dublin he must have, tapping his way round by the stones. Could he walk in a beeline if he hadn't that cane? Bloodless pious face like a fellow going in to be a priest.
Penrose! That was that chap's name.
Look at all the things they can learn to do. Read with their fingers. Tune pianos. Or we are surprised they have any brains. Why we think a deformed person or a hunchback clever if he says something we might say. Of course the other senses are more. Embroider. Plait baskets. People ought to help. Workbasket I could buy for Molly's birthday. Hates sewing. Might take an objection. Dark men they call them.
Sense of smell must be stronger too. Smells on all sides, bunched together. Each street different smell. Each person too. Then the spring, the summer: smells. Tastes? They say you can't taste wines with your eyes shut or a cold in the head. Also smoke in the dark they say get no pleasure.
And with a woman, for instance. More shameless not seeing. That girl passing the Stewart institution, head in the air. Look at me. I have them all on. Must be strange not to see her. Kind of a form in his mind's eye. The voice, temperatures: when he touches her with his fingers must almost see the lines, the curves. His hands on her hair, for instance. Say it was black, for instance. Good. We call it black. Then passing over her white skin. Different feel perhaps. Feeling of white.
Postoffice. Must answer. Fag today. Send her a postal order two shillings, half a crown. Accept my little present. Stationer's just here too. Wait. Think over it.
With a gentle finger he felt ever so slowly the hair combed back above his ears. Again. Fibres of fine fine straw. Then gently his finger felt the skin of his right cheek. Downy hair there too. Not smooth enough. The belly is the smoothest. No-one about. There he goes into Frederick street. Perhaps to Levenston's dancing academy piano. Might be settling my braces.
Walking by Doran's publichouse he slid his hand between his waistcoat and trousers and, pulling aside his shirt gently, felt a slack fold of his belly. But I know it's whitey yellow. Want to try in the dark to see.
He withdrew his hand and pulled his dress to.
Poor fellow! Quite a boy. Terrible. Really terrible. What dreams would he have, not seeing? Life a dream for him. Where is the justice being born that way? All those women and children excursion beanfeast burned and drowned in New York. Holocaust. Karma they call that transmigration for sins you did in a past life the reincarnation met him pike hoses. Dear, dear, dear. Pity, of course: but somehow you can't cotton on to them someway.
Sir Frederick Falkiner going into the freemasons' hall. Solemn as Troy. After his good lunch in Earlsfort terrace. Old legal cronies cracking a magnum. Tales of the bench and assizes and annals of the bluecoat school. I sentenced him to ten years. I suppose he'd turn up his nose at that stuff I drank. Vintage wine for them, the year marked on a dusty bottle. Has his own ideas of justice in the recorder's court. Wellmeaning old man. Police chargesheets crammed with cases get their percentage manufacturing crime. Sends them to the rightabout. The devil on moneylenders. Gave Reuben J. a great strawcalling. Now he's really what they call a dirty jew. Power those judges have. Crusty old topers in wigs. Bear with a sore paw. And may the Lord have mercy on your soul.
Hello, placard. Mirus bazaar. His Excellency the lord lieutenant. Sixteenth. Today it is. In aid of funds for Mercer's hospital. The Messiah was first given for that. Yes. Handel. What about going out there: Ballsbridge. Drop in on Keyes. No use sticking to him like a leech. Wear out my welcome. Sure to know someone on the gate.
Mr Bloom came to Kildare street. First I must. Library.
Straw hat in sunlight. Tan shoes. Turnedup trousers. It is. It is.
His heart quopped softly. To the right. Museum. Goddesses. He swerved to the right.
Is it? Almost certain. Won't look. Wine in my face. Why did I? Too heady. Yes, it is. The walk. Not see. Get on.
Making for the museum gate with long windy steps he lifted his eyes. Handsome building. Sir Thomas Deane designed. Not following me?
Didn't see me perhaps. Light in his eyes.
The flutter of his breath came forth in short sighs. Quick. Cold statues: quiet there. Safe in a minute.
No. Didn't see me. After two. Just at the gate.
My heart!
His eyes beating looked steadfastly at cream curves of stone. Sir Thomas Deane was the Greek architecture.
Look for something I.
His hasty hand went quick into a pocket, took out, read unfolded Agendath Netaim. Where did I?
Busy looking.
He thrust back quick Agendath.
Afternoon she said.
I am looking for that. Yes, that. Try all pockets. Handker. Freeman. Where did I? Ah, yes. Trousers. Potato. Purse. Where?
Hurry. Walk quietly. Moment more. My heart.

No van a poder conmigo (No), yo me defiendo así (Sí)
Cerca de mi enemigo (Yo), para sobrevivir (Oh)
Ni un botellazo limpio me sacará de aquí
Lucho por mi muerte, gloria, victoria o mi fin (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Cual gladiador espartano, soy hermano del dolor
Tu horror será todo mi honor y un error se paga con sangre, hermano
Mi ejercito son cuatro, escríbelo en romano
Arena es mi escenario; Vince, Alonzo, Sya y Soprano
Antes la muerte que el silencio, necios, no vais a callarme
Siempre aguantaré de pie, no tenéis con qué amenazarme
Vivo sin miedo, mi vida es un duelo, sé que no lo puedo dejar

Qui s’en va au front sans peur, du sang sur les lèvres ?
Ni pleurs, ni trêves, voilà les sentinelles

Au milieu des corps, au milieu des coups
Au milieu de ceux qui passent leur temps à viser les médailles que j’ai au cou
Dis-leur qu’au départ j’rappais pour la paix, qu’au départ j’rappais pour tripper

114,167066117,Totoo,Soapdish,[20],['Alternative'],"INTRODUCTION
After he had spent four years in a Siberian prison the great Russian novelist Dostoevsky commented surprisingly that his time in prison had created in him a deep optimism about the ultimate future of mankind because, as he put it, if man could survive the horrors of prison life he must surely be a “creature who could withstand anything.”  The cruel irony which Dostoevsky overlooked is that the reality of prison bears witness not only to the resiliency and adaptiveness of the men who tolerate life within its walls, but as well to the “ingenuity” and tenacity of those who devised and still maintain our correctional and reformatory systems.
Nevertheless, in the century which has passed since Dostoevsky’s imprisonment, little has changed to render the main thrust of his statement less relevant.  Although we have passed through periods of enlightened humanitarian reform, in which physical within prisons have improved somewhat, and the rhetoric of rehabilitation has replaced the language of punitive incarceration, the social institution of prison has continued to fail.  On purely pragmatic grounds, there is substantial evidence that prisons really neither “rehabilitate” nor act as a deterrent to future crime—in America, recidivism rates upwards of 75 percent speak quite decisively to these criteria. And, to perpetuate what is also an economic failure, American taxpayers alone must provide an expenditure for ‘corrections” of 1.5 billion dollars annually.  On humanitarian grounds as well, prisons have failed; our mass media are increasingly filled with accounts of atrocities committed daily, man against man, in reaction to the penal system or in the name of it.  The experience of prison creates undeniably, almost to the point of cliché, an intense hatred and disrespect in most inmates for the authority and the established order of society into which they will eventually return.  And the toll it takes in the deterioration of human spirit for those who must administer it, as well as for those upon whom it is inflicted, is incalculable.
Attempts to provide an explanation of the deplorable condition of our penal system and its dehumanizing effects upon prisoners and guards often focus upon what might be called the dispositional hypothesis. While this explanation is rarely expressed explicitly, it is central to a prevalent nonconscious ideology: that the state of the social institution of prison is due to the “nature"" of the people who administrate it, or the “nature"" of the people who populate it, or both. That is, a major contributing cause to despicable conditions, violence, brutality, dehumanization and degradation existing within any prison can be traced to some innate or acquired characteristic of the correctional and inmate population. Thus on the one hand, there is the contention that violence and brutality exist within prison because guards are sadistic, uneducated, and insensitive people. It is the ""guard mentality,"" a unique syndrome of negative traits which they bring into the situation, that engenders the inhumane treatment of prisoners. On the other hand, there is the argument that prison violence and brutality are the logical and predictable results of the involuntary conﬁnement of a collective of individuals whose life histories are, by deﬁnition, characterized by disregard for law, order and social convention and a concurrent propensity for impulsivity and aggression. In seeming logic, it follows that these individuals, having proven themselves incapable of functioning satisfactorily within the “normal"" structure of society, cannot do so either inside the structure provided by prisons. To control such men, the argument continues, whose basic orientation to any conﬂict situation is to react with physical power or deception, force must be met with force, and a certain number of violent encounters must be expected and tolerated by the public.
The dispositional hypothesis has been embraced by the proponents of the prison status quo (blaming conditions on the evil in the prisoners), as well as by its critics (attributing the evil to guards and staff with their evil motives and deﬁcient personality structures). The appealing simplicity of this proposition localizes the source of prison riots, recidivism and corruption in these “bad seeds“ and not in the conditions of the ""prison soil.""  Such an analysis directs attention away from the complex matrix of social, economic and political forces that combine to make prisons what they are—and that would require complex, expensive, revolutionary actions to bring about any meaningful change. Instead, rioting prisoners are identiﬁed, punished, transferred to maximum security institutions or shot, outside agitators sought, and corrupt officials suspended—while the system itself goes on essentially unchanged. its basic structure unexamined and unchallenged.
However, the dispositional hypothesis cannot be critically evaluated directly through observation in existing prison settings, because such naturalistic observation necessarily confounds the acute effects of the environment with the chronic characteristics of the inmate and guard populations. To separate the effects of the prison environment per se from those attributable to a priori dispositions of its inhabitants requires a research strategy in which a ""new"" prison is constructed, comparable in its fundamental social-psychological milieu to existing prison systems. but entirely populated by individuals who are undifferentiated in all essential dimensions from the rest of society.
Such was the approach taken in the present empirical study, namely, to create a prison-like situation in which the guards and inmates were initially comparable and characterized as being ""normal-average,"" and then to observe the patterns of behavior which resulted, as well as the cognitive, emotional and attitudinal reactions which emerged. Thus, we began our experiment with a sample of individuals who were in the normal range of the general population on a variety of dimensions we were able to measure. Half were randomly assigned to the role of “prisoner,"" the others to that of “guard,"" neither group having any history of crime, emotional disability, physical handicap or even intellectual or social disadvantage.
The environment created was that of a “mock"" prison which physically constrained the prisoners in barred cells and psychologically conveyed the sense of imprisonment to all participants. Our intention was not to created a literal simulation of an American prison, but rather a functional representation of one. For ethical, moral and pragmatic reasons we could not detain our subjects for extended or indeﬁnite periods of time, we could not exercise the threat and promise of severe physical punishment, we could not allow homosexual or racist practices to ﬂourish, nor could we duplicate certain other speciﬁc aspects of prison life. Nevertheless, we believed that we could create a situation with sufficient mundane realism to allow the role—playing participants to go beyond the superﬁcial demands of their assignment into the deep structure of the characters they represented. To do so. we established functional equivalents for the activities and experiences of actual prison life which were expected to produce qualitatively similar psychological reactions in our subjects — feelings of power and powerlessness, of control and oppression, of satisfaction and frustration, of arbitrary rule and
resistance to authority, of status and anonymity, of machismo and emasculation. In the conventional terminology of experimental social psychology, we ﬁrst identiﬁed a number of relevant conceptual variables through analysis of existing prison situations, then designed a setting in which these variables were operationalized. No speciﬁc hypotheses were advanced other than the general one that assignment to the treatment of “guard"" or ""prisoner"" would result in signiﬁcantly different reactions on behavioral measures of interaction, emotional measures of mood state and pathology, attitudes toward self, as well as other indices of coping and adaptation to this novel situation. What follows is a discussion of how we created and peopled our prison, what we observed, what our subjects reported, and ﬁnally, what we can conclude about the nature of the prison environment and the psychology of imprisonment which can account for the failure of our prisons.
METHOD
Overview
The effects of playing the role of “guard"" or ""prisoner"" were studied in the context of an experimental simulation of a prison environment. The research design was a relatively simple one, involving as it did only a single treatment variable, the random assignment to either a “guard"" or ""prisoner"" condition. These roles were enacted over an extended period of time (nearly one week) within an environment that was physically constructed to resemble a prison. Central to the methodology of creating and maintaining a psychological state of imprisonment was the functional simulation of signiﬁcant properties of ""real prison life"" (established through information from former inmates, correctional personnel and texts).
The “guards"" were free within certain limits to implement the procedures of induction into the prison setting and maintenance of custodial retention of the ""prisoners."" These inmates, having voluntarily submitted to the conditions of this total institution in which they now lived, coped in various ways with its stresses and its challenges. The behavior of both groups of subjects was observed, recorded, and analyzed. The dependent measures were of two general types: (l) transactions between and within each group of subjects, recorded on video and audio tape as well as directly observed; (2) individual reactions on questionnaires, mood inventories, personality tests, daily guard shift reports, and post experimental interviews.
Subjects
The 22 subjects who participated in the experiment were selected from an initial pool of 75 respondents, who answered a newspaper ad asking for male volunteers to participate in a psychological study of “prison life"" in return for payment of $15 per day. Each respondent completed an extensive questionnaire concerning his family background, physical and mental health history, prior experience and attitudinal propensities with respect to sources of psychopathology (including their involvements in crime). Each respondent also was interviewed by one of two experimenters. Finally. the 24 subjects who were judged to be most stable (physically and mentally), most mature, and least involved in anti-social behaviors were selected to participate in the study. On a random basis, half of the subjects were assigned the role of “guard,"" half were assigned to the role of “prisoner.“
The subjects were normal, healthy, male college students who were in the Stanford area during the summer. They were largely of middle class socio-economic status and Caucasians (with the exception of one Oriental subject). Initially they were strangers to each other, a selection precaution taken to avoid the disruption of any pre-existing friendship patterns and to mitigate against any transfer into the experimental situation of previously established relationships or patterns of behavior.
This ﬁnal sample of subjects was administered a battery of psychological tests on the day prior to the start of the simulation, but to avoid any selective bias on the part of the experimenter—observers, scores were not tabulated until the study was completed.
Two subjects who were assigned to be a “stand-by"" in case an additional “prisoner"" was needed were not called, and one assigned to be a “stand-by"" guard decided against participating just before the simulation phase began-thus, our data analysis is based upon ten prisoners and eleven guards in our experimental conditions.
PROCEDURE
Physical Aspects of the Prison
The prison was built in a 35-foot section of a basement corridor in the psychology building at Stanford University. It was partitioned by two fabricated walls; one was ﬁtted with the only entrance door to the cell block and the other contained a small observation screen. Three small cells (6 X 9 ft.) were made from converted laboratory rooms by replacing the usual doors with steel barred, black painted ones, and removing all furniture.
A cot (with mattress, sheet and pillow) for each prisoner was the only furniture in the cells. A small closet across from the cells served as a solitary conﬁnement facility; its dimensions were extremely small (2 X 2 X 7 ft.), and it was unlighted.
In addition, several rooms in an adjacent wing of the building were used as guard’s quarters (to change in and out of uniform or for rest and relaxation), a bedroom for the “warden"" and “superintendent,"" and an interview—testing room. Behind the observation screen at one end of the “yard"" (small enclosed room representing the fenced prison grounds) was video recording equipment and sufficient space for several observers.
Operational Details
The ""prisoner"" subjects remained in the mock-prison 24 hours per day for the duration of the study. Three were arbitrarily assigned to each of the three cells; the others were on stand-by call at their homes. The “guard"" subjects worked on three-man, eight-hour shifts; remaining in the prison environment only during their work shift and going"" about their usual lives at other times.
Role Instructions
All subjects had been told that they would be assigned either the guard or the prisoner role on a completely random basis and all had voluntarily agreed to play either role for $15.00 per day for up to two weeks. They signed a contract guaranteeing a minimally adequate diet, clothing, housing and medical care as well as the ﬁnancial remuneration in return for their stated “intention“ of serving in the assigned role for the duration of the study.
It was made explicit in the contract that those assigned to be prisoners should expect to be under surveillance (have little or no privacy) and to have some of their basic civil rights suspended during their imprisonment, excluding physical abuse. They were given no other information about what to expect nor instructions about behavior appropriate for a prisoner role. Those actually assigned to this treatment were informed by phone to be available at their place of residence on a given Sunday when we would start the experiment.
The subjects assigned to be guards attended an orientation meeting on the day prior to the induction of the prisoners. At this time they were introduced to the principal investigators, the ""Superintendent"" of the prison (the author) and an undergraduate research assistant who assumed the administrative role of ""Warden.“ They were told that we wanted to try to simulate a prison environment within the limits imposed by pragmatic and ethical considerations. Their assigned task was to “maintain the reasonable degree of order within the prison necessary for its effective functioning,"" although the speciﬁcs of how this duty might be implemented were not explicitly detailed. They were made aware of the fact that, while many of the contingencies with which they might be confronted were essentially unpredictable (e.g., prisoner escape attempts), part of their task was to be prepared for such eventualities and to be able to deal appropriately with the variety of situations that might arise. The “Warden"" instructed the guards in the administrative details, including: the work-shifts, the mandatory daily completion of shift reports concerning the activity of guards and prisoners, the completion of ""critical incident"" reports which detailed unusual occurrences, and the administration of meals, work and recreation programs for the prisoners. In order to begin to involve these subjects in their roles even before the first prisoner was incarcerated, the guards assisted in the ﬁnal phases of completing the prison complex—putting the cots in the cells, signs on the walls. setting up the guards' quarters, moving furniture, water coolers, refrigerators, etc.
The guards generally believed that we were primarily interested in studying the behavior of the prisoners. Of course. we were as interested in the effects which enacting the role of guard in this environment would have on their behavior and subjective states.
To optimize the extent to which their behavior would reflect their genuine reactions to the experimental prison situation and not simply their ability to follow instructions. they were intentionally given only minimal guidelines for what it meant to be a guard. An explicit and categorical prohibition against the use of physical punishment or physical aggression was, however, emphasized by the experimenters. Thus, with this single notable exception, their roles were relatively unstructured initially, requiring each “guard"" to carry out activities necessary for interacting with a group of “prisoners"" as well as with other “guards"" and the “correctional staff.""
Uniforms
In order to promote feelings of anonymity in the subjects each group was issued identical uniforms. For the guards, the uniform consisted of: plain khaki shirts and trousers, a whistle, a police night stick (wooden batons), and reﬂecting sunglasses which made eye contact impossible. The prisoners' uniform consisted of a loose ﬁtting muslin smock with an identiﬁcation number on front and back, no underclothes, a light chain and lock around one ankle, rubber sandals and a cap made from a nylon stocking. Each prisoner also was issued a toothbrush. soap, soapdish, towel and bed linen. No personal belongings were allowed in the cells.
The outﬁtting of both prisoners and guards in this manner served to enhance group identify and reduce individual uniqueness within the two groups. The khaki uniforms were intended to convey a military attitude, while the whistle and night-stick were carried as symbols of control and power. The prisoners' uniforms were designed not only to deindividuate the prisoners but to be humiliating and serve as symbols of their dependence and subservience. The ankle chain was a constant reminder (even during their sleep when it hit the other ankle) of the oppressiveness of the environment. The stocking cap removed any distinctiveness associated with hair length. color or style (as does shaving of heads in some “real"" prisons and the military). The ill-ﬁtting uniforms made the prisoners feel awkward in their movements; since these ""dresses"" were wom without undergarments, the uniforms forced them to assume unfamiliar postures, more like those of a woman than a man-another part of the emasculating process of becoming a prisoner.
Induction Procedure
With the cooperation of the Palo Alto City Police Department all of the subjects assigned to the prisoner treatment were unexpectedly
“arrested"" at their residences. A police officer charged them with suspicion of burglary or armed robbery, advised them of their legal
rights, handcuffed them, thoroughly searched them (often as curious neighbors looked on) and carried them off to the police station in the rear of the police car. At the station they went through the standard routines of being ﬁngerprinted, having an identiﬁcation ﬁle prepared and then being placed in a detention cell. Each prisoner was blindfolded and subsequently driven by one of the experimenters and a subject-guard to our mock prison. Throughout the entire arrest procedure, the police ofﬁcers involved maintained a formal, serious attitude, avoiding answering any questions of clariﬁcation as to the relation of this ""arrest"" to the mock prison study.

Upon arrival at our experimental prison, each prisoner was stripped, sprayed with a delousing preparation (a deodorant spray) and made to stand alone naked for a while in the cell yard. After being given the uniform described previously and having an I.D. picture taken (“mug shot""), the prisoner was put in his cell and ordered to remain silent.
Administrative Routine
When all the cells were occupied, the warden greeted the prisoners and read them the rules of the institution (developed by the guards and the warden). They were to be memorized and to be followed. Prisoners were to be referred to only by the number on their uniforms, also in an effort to depersonalize them.
The prisoners were to be served three bland meals per day, were allowed three supervised toilet visits, and given two hours daily for
the privilege of reading or letterwriting. Work assignments were issued for.which the prisoners were to receive an hourly wage to constitute their $15 daily payment. Two visiting periods per week were scheduled, as were movie rights and exercise periods. Three times a day all prisoners were lined up for a ""count"" (one on each guard work-shift). The initial purpose of the ""count"" was to ascertain that all prisoners were present, and to test them on their knowledge of the rules and their l.D. numbers. The ﬁrst perfunctory counts lasted only about ten minutes, but on each successive day (or night) they were spontaneously increased in duration until some lasted several hours. Many of the pre-established features of administrative routine were modiﬁed or abandoned by the guards. and some privileges were forgotten by the staff over the course of study.
RESULTS
Overview
Although it is difﬁcult to anticipate exactly what the influence of incarceration will be upon the individuals who are subjected to it and those charged with its maintenance. especially in a simulated reproduction, the results of the present experiment support many commonly held conceptions of prison life and validate anecdotal evidence supplied by articulate ex-convicts. The environment of arbitrary custody had great impact upon the affective states of both guards and prisoners as well as upon the interpersonal processes taking place between and within those role-groups.
In general, guards and prisoners showed a marked tendency toward increased negativity of affect, and their overall outlook became increasingly negative. As the experiment progressed, prisoners expressed intentions to do harm to others more frequently. For both prisoners and guards, self-evaluations were more deprecating as the experience of the prison environment became internalized.
Overt behavior was generally consistent with the subjective self-reports and affective expressions of the subjects. Despite the fact that guards and prisoners were essentially free to engage in any form of interaction (positive or negative, supportive or affrontive, etc.), the characteristic nature of their encounters tended to be negative, hostile, affrontive and dehumanizing. Prisoners immediately adopted a generally passive response mode while guards assumed a very active initiative role in all interactions. Throughout the experiment, commands were the most frequent form of verbal behavior and, generally, verbal exchanges were strikingly impersonal, with few references to individual identity. Although it was clear to all subjects that the experimenters would not permit physical violence to take place. varieties of less direct aggressive behavior were observed frequently (especially on the part of guards). In lieu of physical violence, verbal affronts were used as one of the most frequent forms of interpersonal contact between guards and prisoners.
The most dramatic evidence of the impact of this situation upon the participants was seen in the gross reactions of ﬁve prisoners who had to be released because of extreme emotional depression, crying, rage and acute anxiety. The pattern of symptoms was quite similar in four of the subjects and began as early as the second day of imprisonment. The ﬁfth subject was released after being treated for a psychosomatic rash which covered portions of his body. Of the remaining prisoners, only two said they were not willing to forfeit the money they had earned in return for being ""paroled."" When the experiment was terminated prematurely after only six days, all the remaining prisoners were delighted by their unexpected good fortune. In contrast, most of the guards seemed to be distressed by the decision to stop the experiment, and it appeared to us that they had become sufficiently involved in their roles that they now enjoyed the extreme control and power which they exercised and were reluctant to give it up. One guard did report being personally upset at the suffering of the prisoners, and claimed to have considered asking to change his role to  become one of them—but never did so. None of the guards ever failed to come to work on time for their shift, and indeed, on several occasions guards remained on duty voluntarily and uncomplaining for extra hours—without additional pay.
The extremely pathological reactions which emerged in both groups of subjects testify to the power of the social forces operating. but still there were individual differences seen in styles of coping with this novel experience and in degrees of successful adaptation to it. Half the prisoners did endure the oppressive atmosphere, and not all the guards resorted to hostility. Some guards were tough but fair (“played by the rules""), some went far beyond their roles to engage in creative cruelty and harassment, while a few were passive and rarely instigated any coercive control over the prisoners.
REALITY OF THE SIMULATION
At this point it seems necessary to confront the critical question of “reality"" in the simulated prison environment: were the behaviors
observed more than the mere acting out assigned roles convincingly? To be sure, ethical, legal and practical considerations set limits upon the degree to which this situation could approach the conditions existing in actual prisons and penitentiaries. Necessarily absent were some of the most salient aspects of prison life reported by criminologists and documented in the writing of prisoners. There was no involuntary homosexuality, no racism, no physical beatings, no threat to life by prisoners against each other or the guards. Moreover, the maximum anticipated “sentence“ was only two weeks and, unlike some prison systems, could not be extended indeﬁnitely for infractions of the internal operating rules of the prison.
In one sense,the profound psychological effects we observed under the relatively minimal prison-like conditions which existed in our mock ‘prison made the results even more signiﬁcant, and force us to wonder about the devastating impact of chronic incarceration in real prisons. Nevertheless, we must contend with the criticism that our conditions were too minimal to provide a meaningful analogue to existing prisons. It is necessary to demonstrate that the participants in this experiment transcended the conscious limits of their preconceived stereotyped roles and their awareness of the artiﬁciality and limited duration of imprisonment. We feel there is abundant evidence that virtually all of the subjects at one time or another experienced reactions which went well beyond the surface demands of role—playing and penetrated the deep structure of the psychology of imprisonment.
Although instructions about how to behave in the roles of guard or prisoner were not explicitly deﬁned, demand characteristics in the experiment obviously exerted some directing influence. Therefore, it is enlightening to look to circumstances where role demands were minimal, where the subjects believed they were not being observed, or where they should not have been behaving under the constraints imposed by their roles (as in “private"" situations), in order to assess whether the role behaviors reflected anything more than public conformity or good acting.
When the private conversations of the prisoners were monitored, we learned that almost all (a full 90 per cent) of what they talked about was directly related to immediate prison conditions, that is, food, privileges, punishment, guard harassment, etc. Only one-tenth of the time did their conversations deal with their life outside the prison. Consequently, although they had lived together under such intense conditions, the prisoners knew surprisingly little about each other's past history or future plans. This excessive concentration on the vicissitudes of their current situation helped to make the prison experience more oppressive for the prisoners because, instead of escaping from it when they had a chance to do so in the privacy of their cells, the prisoners continued to allow it to dominate their thoughts and social relations. The guards too, rarely exchanged personal information during their relaxation breaks. They either talked about “problem prisoners,"" other prison topics, or did not talk at all. There were few instances of any personal communication across the two role groups. Moreover, when prisoners referred to other prisoners during interviews, they typically deprecated each other, seemingly adopting the guards' negative attitude.
From post experimental data, we discovered that when individual guards were alone with solitary prisoners and out of range of any recording equipment, as on the way to or in the toilet, harassment often was greater than it was on the “Yard."" Similarly, video-taped analyses of total guard aggression showed a daily escalation even after most prisoners had ceased resisting and prisoner deterioration had become visibly obvious to them. Thus, guard aggression was no longer elicited as it was initially in response to perceived threats, but was emitted simply as a “natural"" consequence of being in the uniform of a “guard"" and asserting the power inherent in that role. In speciﬁc instances we noted cases of a guard (who did not know he was being observed) in the early morning hours pacing the Yard as the prisoners slept-vigorously pounding his night stick into his hand while he “kept watch“ over his captives. Or another guard who detained an “incorrigible"" prisoner in solitary conﬁnement beyond the duration set by the guards' own rules, and then he conspired to keep him in the hole all night while attempting to conceal this information from the experimenters who were thought to be too soft on the prisoners.
In passing we may note an additional point about the nature of role-playing and the extent to which actual behavior is “explained away“ by reference to it. It will be recalled that many guards continued to intensify their harassment and aggressive behavior even after the second day of the study, when prisoner deterioration became marked and visible and emotional breakdowns began to occur (in the presence of the guards). When questioned after the study about their persistent affrontive and harassing behavior in the face of prisoner emotional trauma, most guards replied that they were ""just playing the role“ of a tough guard, although none ever doubted the magnitude or validity of the prisoners' emotional response. The reader may wish to consider to what extremes an individual may go, how great must be the consequences of his behavior for others, before he can no longer rightfully attribute his actions to “playing a role"" and thereby abdicate responsibility.
When introduced to a Catholic priest. many of the role-playing prisoners referred to themselves by their prison number rather than their Christian names. Some even asked him to get a lawyer to help them get out. When a public defender was summoned to interview those prisoners who had not yet been released, almost all of them strenuously demanded that he “bail“ them out immediately.
One of the most remarkable incidents of the study occurred during a parole board hearing when each of ﬁve prisoners eligible for parole was asked by the senior author whether he would be willing to forfeit all the money earned as a prisoner if he were to be paroled (released from the study). Three of the ﬁve prisoners said, “yes,“ they would be willing to do this. Notice that the original incentive for participating in the study had been the promise of money, and they were, after only four days, prepared to give this up completely. And, more surprisingly, when told that this possibility would have to be discussed with the members of the staff before a decision could be made, each prisoner got up quietly and was escorted by a guard back to his cell. If they regarded themselves simply as “subjects"" participating in an experiment for money, there was no longer any incentive to remain in the study and they could have easily escaped this situation which had so clearly become aversive for them by quitting. Yet, so powerful was the control which the situation had come to have over them, so much a reality had this simulated environment become, that they were unable to see that their original and singular motive for remaining no longer obtained, and they returned to their cells to await a “parole"" decision by their captors.
The reality of the prison was also attested to by our prison consultant who had spent over 16 years in prison, as well as the priest who had been a prison chaplain and the public defender, all of whom were brought into direct contact with our simulated prison environment. Further, the depressed affect of the prisoners, the guards' willingness to work overtime for no additional pay, the spontaneous use of prison titles and ID numbers in non role-related situations all point to a level of reality as real as any other in the lives of all those who shared this experience.
To understand how an illusion of imprisonment could have become so real, we need now to consider the uses of power by the guards as well as the effects of such power in shaping the prisoner mentality.
PATHOLOGY OF POWER
Being a guard carried with it social status within the prison, a group identity (when wearing the uniform), and above all, the freedom to exercise an unprecedented degree of control over the lives of other human beings. This control was invariably expressed in terms of sanctions, punishment, demands, and with the threat of manifest physical power. There was no need for the guards to rationally justify a request as they did their ordinary life, and merely to make a demand was sufficient to have it carried out. Many of the guards showed in their behavior and revealed in post-experimental statements that this sense of power was exhilarating.
The use of power was self-aggrandizing and self-perpetuating. The guard power, derived initially from an arbitrary and randomly assigned label, was intensiﬁed whenever there was any perceived threat by the prisoners and this new level subsequently became the baseline from which further hostility and harassment would begin. The most hostile guards on each shift moved spontaneously into the leadership roles of giving orders and deciding on punishments. They became role models whose behavior was emulated by other members of the shift. Despite
minimal contact between the three separate guard shifts and nearly 16 hours a day spent away from the prison, the absolute level of aggression, as well as more subtle and “creative"" forms of aggression manifested, increased in a spiraling function. Not to be tough and arrogant was to be seen as a sign of weakness by the guards, and even those “good"" guards who did not get as drawn into the power syndrome as the others respected the implicit norm of never contradicting or even interfering with an action of a more hostile guard on their shift.
After the ﬁrst day of the study, practically all prisoner rights (even such things as the time and conditions of sleeping and eating) came to be redeﬁned by the guards as “privileges"" which were to be earned by obedient behavior. Constructive activities such as watching movies or reading (previously planned and suggested by the experimenters) were arbitrarily cancelled until further notice by the guards-and were subsequently never allowed. “Reward,"" then became granting approval for prisoners to eat, sleep, go to the toilet, talk, smoke a cigarette, wear eyeglasses, or the temporary diminution of harassment. One wonders about the conceptual nature of “positive"" reinforcement when subjects are in such conditions of deprivation, and the extent to which even minimally acceptable conditions become rewarding when experienced in the context of such an impoverished environment.
We might also question whether there are meaningful non-violent alternatives as models for behavior modiﬁcation in real prisons. In a world where men are either powerful or powerless, everyone learns to despise the lack of power in others and in oneself. It seems to us, that prisoners learn to admire power for its own sake—power becoming the ultimate reward. Real prisoners soon learn the means to gain power whether through ingratiation, informing. sexual control of other prisoners or development of powerful cliques. When they are released from prison, it is likely they will never want to feel so powerless again and will take action to establish and assert a sense of power.
THE PATHOLOGICAL PRISONER SYNDROME
Various coping strategies were employed by our prisoners as they began to react to their perceived loss of personal identity and the arbitrary control of their lives. At ﬁrst they exhibited disbelief at the total invasion of their privacy, constant surveillance, and atmosphere of oppression in which they were living. Their next response was rebellion, ﬁrst by the use of direct force, and later with subtle divisive tactics designed to foster distrust among the prisoners. They then tried to work within the system by setting up an elected grievance committee. When that collective action failed to produce meaningful changes in their existence, individual self-interests emerged. The breakdown in prisoner cohesion was the start of social disintegration which gave rise not only to feelings
of isolation, but deprecation of other prisoners as well. As noted before, half the prisoners coped with the prison situation by becoming “sick“—extremely disturbed emotionally—as a passive way of demanding attention and help. Others became excessively obedient in trying to be ""good"" prisoners. They sided with the guards against a solitary fellow prisoner who coped with his situation by refusing to eat. Instead of supporting this ﬁnal and major act of rebellion, the prisoners treated him as a trouble—maker who deserved to be punished for his disobedience. It is likely that the negative self-regard among the prisoners noted by the end of the study was the product of their coming to believe that the continued hostility toward all of them was justified because they “deserved it"" (following Walster. I966). As the days wore on. the model prisoner reaction was one of passivity, dependence, and ﬂattened affect.
Let us brieﬂy consider some of the relevant processes involved in bringing about these reactions.
Loss of personal identity. For most people identity is conferred by social recognition of one's uniqueness, and established through one's name, dress, appearance, behavior style and history. Living among strangers who do not know your name or history (who refer to you only by number), dressed in a uniform exactly like all other prisoners, not wanting to call attention to one's self because of the unpredictable consequences it might provoke—all led to a weakening of self identity among the prisoners. As they began to lose initiative and emotional responsivity. while acting ever more compliantly, indeed. the prisoners became deindividuated not only to the guards and the observers, but also to themselves.
Arbitrary control. On post-experimental questionnaires, the most frequently mentioned aversive aspect of the prison experience was that of being subjugated to the patently arbitrary, capricious decisions and rules of the guards. A question by a prisoner as often elicited derogation and aggression as it did a rational answer. Smiling at a joke could be punished in the same way that failing to smile might be. An individual acting in defiance of the rules could bring punishment to innocent cell partners (who became, in effect, ""mutually yoked controls“), to himself. or to all.
As the environment became more unpredictable, and previously learned assumptions about a just and orderly world were no longer functional, prisoners ceased to initiate any action. They moved about on orders and when in their cells rarely engaged in any purposeful activity. Their zombie-like reaction was the functional equivalent of the learned helplessness phenomenon reported by Seligman & Grove (1970). Since their behavior did not seem to have any contingent relationship to environmental consequences, the prisoners essentially gave up and stopped behaving. Thus the subjective magnitude of aversiveness was manipulated by the guards not in terms of physical punishment but
rather by controlling the psychological dimension of environmental predictability (Singer & Glass. 1972).
Dependency and emasculation. The network of dependency relations established by the guards not only promoted helplessness in the prisoners but served to emasculate them as well. The arbitrary control by the guards put the prisoners at their mercy for even the daily, commonplace functions like going to the toilet. To do so, required publicly obtained permission (not always granted) and then a personal escort to the toilet while blindfolded and handcuffed. The same was true for many other activities ordinarily practiced spontaneously without thought, such as lighting a cigarette, reading a novel, writing a letter, drinking a glass of water, or brushing one's teeth. These were all privileged activities requiring permission and necessitating a prior show of good behavior. These low level dependencies engendered a regressive orientation in the prisoners. Their dependency was defined in terms of the extent of the domain of control over all aspects of their lives which they allowed other individuals (the guards and prison stall) to exercise.
As in real prisons, the assertive, independent, aggressive nature of male prisoners posed a threat which was overcome by a variety of
tactics. The prisoner uniforms resembled smocks or dresses, which made them look silly and enabled the guards to refer to them as “sissies“ or “girls."" Wearing these uniforms without any underclothes forced the prisoners to move and sit in unfamiliar, feminine postures. Any sign of individual rebellion was labelled as indicative of “incorrigibility"" and resulted in loss of privileges, solitary confinement, humiliation or punishment of cell mates. Physically smaller guards were able to induce stronger prisoners to act foolishly and obediently. Prisoners were encouraged to belittle each other publicly during the counts. These and other tactics all served to engender in the prisoners a lessened sense of their masculinity (as deﬁned by their external culture). It followed then, that although the prisoners usually outnumbered the guards during line-ups and counts (nine vs. three) there never was an attempt to directly overpower them. (Interestingly, after the study was terminated, the prisoners expressed the belief that the basis for assignment to guard and prisoner groups was physical size. They perceived the guards were ""bigger,“ when, in fact, there was no difference in average height or weight between these randomly determined groups.)
In conclusion, we believe this demonstration reveals new dimensions in the social psychology of imprisonment worth pursuing in future research. In addition, this research provides a paradigm and information base for studying alternatives to existing guard training, as well as for questioning the basic operating principles on which penal institutions rest. If our mock prison could generate the extent of pathology it did in such a short time, then the punishment of being imprisoned in a real prison does not ""fit the crime"" for most prisoners—indeed, it far exceeds it! Moreover, since both prisoners and guards are locked into a dynamic, symbiotic relationship which is destructive to their human nature, guards are also society's prisoners.

Are we boys going to be beaten by a bunch of skirts? Come on, fellows, let's work up some real genuine enthusiasm and all boost together for the snappiest dinner yet! Elegant eats, short ginger-talks, and memories shared together of the brightest, gladdest days of life.
    The dinner was held in a private room at the Union Club. The club was a dingy building, three pretentious old dwellings knocked together, and the entrance-hall resembled a potato cellar, yet the Babbitt who was free of the magnificence of the Athletic Club entered with embarrassment. He nodded to the doorman, an ancient proud negro with brass buttons and a blue tail-coat, and paraded through the hall, trying to look like a member.
    Sixty men had come to the dinner. They made islands and eddies in the hall; they packed the elevator and the corners of the private dining-room. They tried to be intimate and enthusiastic. They appeared to one another exactly as they had in college—as raw youngsters whose present mustaches, baldnesses, paunches, and wrinkles were but jovial disguises put on for the evening.
    ""You haven't changed a particle!"" they marveled. The men whom they could not recall they addressed, ""Well, well, great to see you again, old man. What are you—Still doing the same thing?""
    Some one was always starting a cheer or a college song, and it was always thinning into silence. Despite their resolution to be democratic they divided into two sets: the men with dress-clothes and the men without. Babbitt (extremely in dress-clothes) went from one group to the other. Though he was, almost frankly, out for social conquest, he sought Paul Riesling first. He found him alone, neat and silent.
    Paul sighed, ""I'm no good at this handshaking and 'well, look who's here' bunk.""
    ""Rats now, Paulibus, loosen up and be a mixer! Finest bunch of boys on earth! Say, you seem kind of glum. What's matter?""
    ""Oh, the usual. Run-in with Zilla.""
    ""Come on! Let's wade in and forget our troubles.""
    He kept Paul beside him, but worked toward the spot where Charles McKelvey stood warming his admirers like a furnace.
    McKelvey had been the hero of the Class of '96; not only football captain and hammer-thrower but debater, and passable in what the State University considered scholarship. He had gone on, had captured the construction-company once owned by the Dodsworths, best-known pioneer family of Zenith. He built state capitols, skyscrapers, railway terminals. He was a heavy-shouldered, big-chested man, but not sluggish. There was a quiet humor in his eyes, a syrup-smooth quickness in his speech, which intimidated politicians and warned reporters; and in his presence the most intelligent scientist or the most sensitive artist felt thin-blooded, unworldly, and a little shabby. He was, particularly when he was influencing legislatures or hiring labor-spies, very easy and lovable and gorgeous. He was baronial; he was a peer in the rapidly crystallizing American aristocracy, inferior only to the haughty Old Families. (In Zenith, an Old Family is one which came to town before 1840.) His power was the greater because he was not hindered by scruples, by either the vice or the virtue of the older Puritan tradition.
    McKelvey was being placidly merry now with the great, the manufacturers and bankers, the land-owners and lawyers and surgeons who had chauffeurs and went to Europe. Babbitt squeezed among them. He liked McKelvey's smile as much as the social advancement to be had from his favor. If in Paul's company he felt ponderous and protective, with McKelvey he felt slight and adoring.
He heard McKelvey say to Max Kruger, the banker, ""Yes, we'll put up Sir Gerald Doak."" Babbitt's democratic love for titles became a rich relish. ""You know, he's one of the biggest iron-men in England, Max. Horribly well-off.... Why, hello, old Georgie! Say, Max, George Babbitt is getting fatter than I am!""
    The chairman shouted, ""Take your seats, fellows!""
    ""Shall we make a move, Charley?"" Babbitt said casually to McKelvey.
    ""Right. Hello, Paul! How's the old fiddler? Planning to sit anywhere special, George? Come on, let's grab some seats. Come on, Max. Georgie, I read about your speeches in the campaign. Bully work!""
    After that, Babbitt would have followed him through fire. He was enormously busy during the dinner, now bumblingly cheering Paul, now approaching McKelvey with ""Hear, you're going to build some piers in Brooklyn,"" now noting how enviously the failures of the class, sitting by themselves in a weedy group, looked up to him in his association with the nobility, now warming himself in the Society Talk of McKelvey and Max Kruger. They spoke of a ""jungle dance"" for which Mona Dodsworth had decorated her house with thousands of orchids. They spoke, with an excellent imitation of casualness, of a dinner in Washington at which McKelvey had met a Senator, a Balkan princess, and an English major-general. McKelvey called the princess ""Jenny,"" and let it be known that he had danced with her.
    Babbitt was thrilled, but not so weighted with awe as to be silent. If he was not invited by them to dinner, he was yet accustomed to talking with bank-presidents, congressmen, and clubwomen who entertained poets. He was bright and referential with McKelvey:
    ""Say, Charley, juh remember in Junior year how we chartered a sea-going hack and chased down to Riverdale, to the big show Madame Brown used to put on? Remember how you beat up that hick constabule that tried to run us in, and we pinched the pants-pressing sign and took and hung it on Prof. Morrison's door? Oh, gosh, those were the days!""
    Those, McKelvey agreed, were the days.
    Babbitt had reached ""It isn't the books you study in college but the friendships you make that counts"" when the men at head of the table broke into song. He attacked McKelvey:
    ""It's a shame, uh, shame to drift apart because our, uh, business activities lie in different fields. I've enjoyed talking over the good old days. You and Mrs. McKelvey must come to dinner some night.""
    Vaguely, ""Yes, indeed—""
    ""Like to talk to you about the growth of real estate out beyond your Grantsville warehouse. I might be able to tip you off to a thing or two, possibly.""
    ""Splendid! We must have dinner together, Georgie. Just let me know. And it will be a great pleasure to have your wife and you at the house,"" said McKelvey, much less vaguely.
    Then the chairman's voice, that prodigious voice which once had roused them to cheer defiance at rooters from Ohio or Michigan or Indiana, whooped, ""Come on, you wombats! All together in the long yell!"" Babbitt felt that life would never be sweeter than now, when he joined with Paul Riesling and the newly recovered hero, McKelvey, in:
    Baaaaaattle-ax Get an ax, Bal-ax, Get-nax, Who, who? The U.! Hooroo!
    III
    The Babbitts invited the McKelveys to dinner, in early December, and the McKelveys not only accepted but, after changing the date once or twice, actually came.
    The Babbitts somewhat thoroughly discussed the details of the dinner, from the purchase of a bottle of champagne to the number of salted almonds to be placed before each person. Especially did they mention the matter of the other guests. To the last Babbitt held out for giving Paul Riesling the benefit of being with the McKelveys. ""Good old Charley would like Paul and Verg Gunch better than some highfalutin' Willy boy,"" he insisted, but Mrs. Babbitt interrupted his observations with, ""Yes—perhaps—I think I'll try to get some Lynnhaven oysters,"" and when she was quite ready she invited Dr. J. T. Angus, the oculist, and a dismally respectable lawyer named Maxwell, with their glittering wives.
    Neither Angus nor Maxwell belonged to the Elks or to the Athletic Club; neither of them had ever called Babbitt ""brother"" or asked his opinions on carburetors. The only ""human people"" whom she invited, Babbitt raged, were the Littlefields; and Howard Littlefield at times became so statistical that Babbitt longed for the refreshment of Gunch's, ""Well, old lemon-pie-face, what's the good word?""
    Immediately after lunch Mrs. Babbitt began to set the table for the seven-thirty dinner to the McKelveys, and Babbitt was, by order, home at four. But they didn't find anything for him to do, and three times Mrs. Babbitt scolded, ""Do please try to keep out of the way!"" He stood in the door of the garage, his lips drooping, and wished that Littlefield or Sam Doppelbrau or somebody would come along and talk to him. He saw Ted sneaking about the corner of the house.
    ""What's the matter, old man?"" said Babbitt.
    ""Is that you, thin, owld one? Gee, Ma certainly is on the warpath! I told her Rone and I would jus' soon not be let in on the fiesta to-night, and she bit me. She says I got to take a bath, too. But, say, the Babbitt men will be some lookers to-night! Little Theodore in a dress-suit!""
    ""The Babbitt men!"" Babbitt liked the sound of it. He put his arm about the boy's shoulder. He wished that Paul Riesling had a daughter, so that Ted might marry her. ""Yes, your mother is kind of rouncing round, all right,"" he said, and they laughed together, and sighed together, and dutifully went in to dress.
    The McKelveys were less than fifteen minutes late.
    Babbitt hoped that the Doppelbraus would see the McKelveys' limousine, and their uniformed chauffeur, waiting in front.
    The dinner was well cooked and incredibly plentiful, and Mrs. Babbitt had brought out her grandmother's silver candlesticks. Babbitt worked hard. He was good. He told none of the jokes he wanted to tell. He listened to the others. He started Maxwell off with a resounding, ""Let's hear about your trip to the Yellowstone."" He was laudatory, extremely laudatory. He found opportunities to remark that Dr. Angus was a benefactor to humanity, Maxwell and Howard Littlefield profound scholars, Charles McKelvey an inspiration to ambitious youth, and Mrs. McKelvey an adornment to the social circles of Zenith, Washington, New York, Paris, and numbers of other places.
But he could not stir them. It was a dinner without a soul. For no reason that was clear to Babbitt, heaviness was over them and they spoke laboriously and unwillingly.
    He concentrated on Lucille McKelvey, carefully not looking at her blanched lovely shoulder and the tawny silken bared which supported her frock.
    ""I suppose you'll be going to Europe pretty soon again, won't you?"" he invited.
    ""I'd like awfully to run over to Rome for a few weeks.""
    ""I suppose you see a lot of pictures and music and curios and everything there.""
    ""No, what I really go for is: there's a little trattoria on the Via della Scrofa where you get the best fettuccine in the world.""
    ""Oh, I—Yes. That must be nice to try that. Yes.""
    At a quarter to ten McKelvey discovered with profound regret that his wife had a headache. He said blithely, as Babbitt helped him with his coat, ""We must lunch together some time, and talk over the old days.""
    When the others had labored out, at half-past ten, Babbitt turned to his wife, pleading, ""Charley said he had a corking time and we must lunch—said they wanted to have us up to the house for dinner before long.""
    She achieved, ""Oh, it's just been one of those quiet evenings that are often so much more enjoyable than noisy parties where everybody talks at once and doesn't really settle down to-nice quiet enjoyment.""
    But from his cot on the sleeping-porch he heard her weeping, slowly, without hope.
    IV
    For a month they watched the social columns, and waited for a return dinner-invitation.
    As the hosts of Sir Gerald Doak, the McKelveys were headlined all the week after the Babbitts' dinner. Zenith ardently received Sir Gerald (who had come to America to buy coal). The newspapers interviewed him on prohibition, Ireland, unemployment, naval aviation, the rate of exchange, tea-drinking versus whisky-drinking, the psychology of American women, and daily life as lived by English county families. Sir Gerald seemed to have heard of all those topics. The McKelveys gave him a Singhalese dinner, and Miss Elnora Pearl Bates, society editor of the Advocate-Times, rose to her highest lark-note. Babbitt read aloud at breakfast-table:
    'Twixt the original and Oriental decorations, the strange and delicious food, and the personalities both of the distinguished guests, the charming hostess and the noted host, never has Zenith seen a more recherche affair than the Ceylon dinner-dance given last evening by Mr. and Mrs. Charles McKelvey to Sir Gerald Doak. Methought as we—fortunate one!—were privileged to view that fairy and foreign scene, nothing at Monte Carlo or the choicest ambassadorial sets of foreign capitals could be more lovely. It is not for nothing that Zenith is in matters social rapidly becoming known as the choosiest inland city in the country.
    Though he is too modest to admit it, Lord Doak gives a cachet to our smart quartier such as it has not received since the ever-memorable visit of the Earl of Sittingbourne. Not only is he of the British peerage, but he is also, on dit, a leader of the British metal industries. As he comes from Nottingham, a favorite haunt of Robin Hood, though now, we are informed by Lord Doak, a live modern city of 275,573 inhabitants, and important lace as well as other industries, we like to think that perhaps through his veins runs some of the blood, both virile red and bonny blue, of that earlier lord o' the good greenwood, the roguish Robin.
    The lovely Mrs. McKelvey never was more fascinating than last evening in her black net gown relieved by dainty bands of silver and at her exquisite waist a glowing cluster of Aaron Ward roses.
    Babbitt said bravely, ""I hope they don't invite us to meet this Lord Doak guy. Darn sight rather just have a nice quiet little dinner with Charley and the Missus.""
    At the Zenith Athletic Club they discussed it amply. ""I s'pose we'll have to call McKelvey 'Lord Chaz' from now on,"" said Sidney Finkelstein.
    ""It beats all get-out,"" meditated that man of data, Howard Littlefield, ""how hard it is for some people to get things straight. Here they call this fellow 'Lord Doak' when it ought to be 'Sir Gerald.'""
    Babbitt marvelled, ""Is that a fact! Well, well! 'Sir Gerald,' eh? That's what you call um, eh? Well, sir, I'm glad to know that.""
    Later he informed his salesmen, ""It's funnier 'n a goat the way some folks that, just because they happen to lay up a big wad, go entertaining famous foreigners, don't have any more idea 'n a rabbit how to address 'em so's to make 'em feel at home!""
That evening, as he was driving home, he passed McKelvey's limousine and saw Sir Gerald, a large, ruddy, pop-eyed, Teutonic Englishman whose dribble of yellow mustache gave him an aspect sad and doubtful. Babbitt drove on slowly, oppressed by futility. He had a sudden, unexplained, and horrible conviction that the McKelveys were laughing at him.
    He betrayed his depression by the violence with which he informed his wife, ""Folks that really tend to business haven't got the time to waste on a bunch like the McKelveys. This society stuff is like any other hobby; if you devote yourself to it, you get on. But I like to have a chance to visit with you and the children instead of all this idiotic chasing round.""
    They did not speak of the McKelveys again.
    V
    It was a shame, at this worried time, to have to think about the Overbrooks.
    Ed Overbrook was a classmate of Babbitt who had been a failure. He had a large family and a feeble insurance business out in the suburb of Dorchester. He was gray and thin and unimportant. He had always been gray and thin and unimportant. He was the person whom, in any group, you forgot to introduce, then introduced with extra enthusiasm. He had admired Babbitt's good-fellowship in college, had admired ever since his power in real estate, his beautiful house and wonderful clothes. It pleased Babbitt, though it bothered him with a sense of responsibility. At the class-dinner he had seen poor Overbrook, in a shiny blue serge business-suit, being diffident in a corner with three other failures. He had gone over and been cordial: ""Why, hello, young Ed! I hear you're writing all the insurance in Dorchester now. Bully work!""
    They recalled the good old days when Overbrook used to write poetry. Overbrook embarrassed him by blurting, ""Say, Georgie, I hate to think of how we been drifting apart. I wish you and Mrs. Babbitt would come to dinner some night.""
    Babbitt boomed, ""Fine! Sure! Just let me know. And the wife and I want to have you at the house."" He forgot it, but unfortunately Ed Overbrook did not. Repeatedly he telephoned to Babbitt, inviting him to dinner. ""Might as well go and get it over,"" Babbitt groaned to his wife. ""But don't it simply amaze you the way the poor fish doesn't know the first thing about social etiquette? Think of him 'phoning me, instead of his wife sitting down and writing us a regular bid! Well, I guess we're stuck for it. That's the trouble with all this class-brother hooptedoodle.""
    He accepted Overbrook's next plaintive invitation, for an evening two weeks off. A dinner two weeks off, even a family dinner, never seems so appalling, till the two weeks have astoundingly disappeared and one comes dismayed to the ambushed hour. They had to change the date, because of their own dinner to the McKelveys, but at last they gloomily drove out to the Overbrooks' house in Dorchester.
    It was miserable from the beginning. The Overbrooks had dinner at six-thirty, while the Babbitts never dined before seven. Babbitt permitted himself to be ten minutes late. ""Let's make it as short as possible. I think we'll duck out quick. I'll say I have to be at the office extra early to-morrow,"" he planned.
    The Overbrook house was depressing. It was the second story of a wooden two-family dwelling; a place of baby-carriages, old hats hung in the hall, cabbage-smell, and a Family Bible on the parlor table. Ed Overbrook and his wife were as awkward and threadbare as usual, and the other guests were two dreadful families whose names Babbitt never caught and never desired to catch. But he was touched, and disconcerted, by the tactless way in which Overbrook praised him: ""We're mighty proud to have old George here to-night! Of course you've all read about his speeches and oratory in the papers—and the boy's good-looking, too, eh?—but what I always think of is back in college, and what a great old mixer he was, and one of the best swimmers in the class.""
    Babbitt tried to be jovial; he worked at it; but he could find nothing to interest him in Overbrook's timorousness, the blankness of the other guests, or the drained stupidity of Mrs. Overbrook, with her spectacles, drab skin, and tight-drawn hair. He told his best Irish story, but it sank like soggy cake. Most bleary moment of all was when Mrs. Overbrook, peering out of her fog of nursing eight children and cooking and scrubbing, tried to be conversational.
    ""I suppose you go to Chicago and New York right along, Mr. Babbitt,"" she prodded.
    ""Well, I get to Chicago fairly often.""
    ""It must be awfully interesting. I suppose you take in all the theaters.""
    ""Well, to tell the truth, Mrs. Overbrook, thing that hits me best is a great big beefsteak at a Dutch restaurant in the Loop!""
    They had nothing more to say. Babbitt was sorry, but there was no hope; the dinner was a failure. At ten, rousing out of the stupor of meaningless talk, he said as cheerily as he could, ""'Fraid we got to be starting, Ed. I've got a fellow coming to see me early to-morrow."" As Overbrook helped him with his coat, Babbitt said, ""Nice to rub up on the old days! We must have lunch together, P.D.Q.""
    Mrs. Babbitt sighed, on their drive home, ""It was pretty terrible. But how Mr. Overbrook does admire you!""
    ""Yep. Poor cuss! Seems to think I'm a little tin archangel, and the best-looking man in Zenith.""
    ""Well, you're certainly not that but—Oh, Georgie, you don't suppose we have to invite them to dinner at our house now, do we?""
    ""Ouch! Gaw, I hope not!""
    ""See here, now, George! You didn't say anything about it to Mr. Overbrook, did you?""
    ""No! Gee! No! Honest, I didn't! Just made a bluff about having him to lunch some time.""
    ""Well.... Oh, dear.... I don't want to hurt their feelings. But I don't see how I could stand another evening like this one. And suppose somebody like Dr. and Mrs. Angus came in when we had the Overbrooks there, and thought they were friends of ours!""
    For a week they worried, ""We really ought to invite Ed and his wife, poor devils!"" But as they never saw the Overbrooks, they forgot them, and after a month or two they said, ""That really was the best way, just to let it slide. It wouldn't be kind to THEM to have them here. They'd feel so out of place and hard-up in our home.""
    They did not speak of the Overbrooks again."

The shots pans down past several signs on the gate: Keep Out, Danger Electrified Fence, Trespassers Will Be Shot, and Free Kittens - Inquire Within. Outside the front door, several guards march up and down, chanting.
GUARDS
All we own, we o-owe, all we own, we o-owe.
SMITHERS
(leaning out of a window) Shh!
GUARDS
(quieter) All we own, we o-owe, all we own, we o-owe . . .
Inside the mansion, Burns is in bed. We see his dream - a young Burns, playing with a stuffed bear.
BURNS
Tra-la-la-la-la-la! Tra-la-la-la-la! I'm the happiest boy there is, aren't I, Bobo?
A limousine pulls up, and the passenger talks to Burns's parents.
MOTHER
Happy! Come here, Happy!
BURNS
Yes, Mumsy?
FATHER
Happy, would you like to continue living with us, your loving natural parents, or would you rather live with this twisted, loveless billionaire?
Burns drops the bear, jumps into the limo, and puts sunglasses on.
BURNS
Let's roll!
FATHER
(calling after him) Wait! You forgot your bear, a symbol of your lost youth and innocence! Ah, oh well, at least we still have his little brother George.
GEORGE
(sings) Bwa bwa bwa bwa, Oh the sun shines bright on my old Kentucky Home, Bwa bwa bwa bwa... (spoken) Trust me, it'll be funny when I'm an old man.
The dream fades back to the present. Burns tosses and turns in his bed, holding a Nev-R-Break snow globe.
BURNS
I want my... teddy...
Smithers walks in as he drops the snow globe.
BURNS
Bobo... Bobo... (Smithers wakes him up) Huh? Oh, it's you. The bedpan's under my pillow.
SMITHERS
Who's Bobo, sir?
BURNS
Bobo? Uh, I... I... I meant Lobo! Uh, Sheriff Lobo: they never should have cancelled that show.
SMITHERS
I see. On another topic, the preparations for your birthday have begun.
BURNS
I won't get what I really want.
SMITHERS
No one does...
Smithers imagines a naked Mr. Burns popping out of a birthday cake, singing.
BURNS
Happy Birthday, Mr. Smithers!
Smithers groans with pleasure. At the Simpsons home, Homer tosses in bed.
HOMER
Lobo... Lobo... Bring back Sheriff Lobo... Lobo... Lobo! (waking up with a jolt) Aaah!
MARGE
What is it?
Homer points to the calendar by the bed.
HOMER
Oh no! Burns's birthday!
MARGE
What's wrong?
HOMER
Every time Mr. Burns has a birthday, all the employees have to help out at the party. And I always get some terrible job.
He recalls holding a piñata while a blindfolded Burns swings at it.
BURNS
Where is that dreaded piñata?
HOMER
(hit by Burns) Ow. (hit) Ow. (hit) Ow. (hit) Missed me, heh heh! (hit) Ow.
Back to reality, and Marge has fallen back asleep.
Later that day at work, Homer is being played a prank on by his co-workers. They look on and laugh as Homer struggles to remove a coat hanger stuck in his shirt.
HOMER
Not funny! And the one in my pant really hurts!
Everyone laughs harder. Meanwhile, Burns watches him on the security monitors.
BURNS
That man who's getting all those laughs, Smithers---who is he?
SMITHERS
Homer Simpson, sir, one of the carbon blobs from sector 7-G, but I don't think---
BURNS
I want this Simpson fellow to perform comedy at my party. I must harness his fractured take on modern life.
SMITHERS
Fine, sir. I'll get him started on some snappy Sinbad-esque material.
Back at home, Homer writes his comedy act.
HOMER
(chuckling) Hee hee hee, I'm so funny. This is gonna be great!
MARGE
What are you doing?
HOMER
I'm writing a delicious send-up of Mr. Burns for his birthday party. Is poopoo one word or two?
Homer & Bart laugh.
MARGE
I don't think it's a good idea to humiliate your boss on his birthday.
LISA
Actually, Mom, a tweaking of Mr. Burns's foibles, if done with the greatest of care, could earn Dad a special place in the old man's heart.
HOMER
Well, I also do a delightful impression of him. (Chuckles) I paint a frowny face on my butt and pull down my pants!
Bart laughs and gives Homer a high-five. Marge and Lisa groan.
It's Burns's birthday. Homer practices his comedy act in front of the mirror.
HOMER
Now, I'm not saying Mr. Burns is incontinent...
BART
Incontinent! (laughs) Too rich!
LISA
Does either of you know what incontinent means?
HOMER
Lisa, don't spoil our fun.
MARGE
Come on, everybody, it's time to go.
HOMER
Okay, stupid!
MARGE
Homer, you've got to stop insulting everyone, especially your boss!
HOMER
Marge, the comedy roast is an American tradition. It's what gives us the freedom to criticize our social betters. (outside) Hey Flanders! You smell like manure!
FLANDERS
Uh oh. Better cancel that dinner party tonight. Thanks for the nose news, neighbor!
At the party, the guests enter. Former President George Bush is pulled aside by one of the guards.
GUARD
Hey! No one-termers.
Bush is pushed aside. Jimmy Carter has also been refused entry.
CARTER
You too, huh? Hey, I know a good yogurt place.
BUSH
Get away from me, loser.
Inside Burns's mansion. Smithers introduces the party.
SMITHERS
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Montgomery Burns: the life.
He shows some slides from Mr. Burns's life. A slide showing Burns with Bobo comes up.
BURNS
Oh, Bobo...
SMITHERS
Here are several fine young men who I'm sure are gonna go far. Ladies and gentlemen, the Ramones!
BURNS
Ah, these minstrels will soothe my jangled nerves.
RAMONE #1
I'd just like to say this gig sucks!
RAMONE #2
Hey, up yours, Springfield.
RAMONE #1
One, two, three, four! (loud guitar music begins) Happy birthday to you!
RAMONE #2
(backing) Happy birthday!
RAMONE #1
Happy birthday to you!
RAMONE #2
(backing) Happy birthday!
RAMONE #1
Happy birthday, Burnsie, happy birthday to you!
RAMONE #3
Go to hell, you old bastard!
The song finishes and the curtain closes.
RAMONE #4
Hey, I think they liked us.
BURNS
Have the Rolling Stones killed.
SMITHERS
But sir, those aren't the---
BURNS
Do as I say!
Burns opens his presents.
BURNS
Uh, stink, piffle . . . Dust Buster? Ugh . . .
Marge groans. Smithers brings a TV screen into view.
SMITHERS
Sir, I've arranged for the people of Australia to join hands tonight and spell out your name with candles. There's a satellite hookup on that monitor if you'll just turn your head slightly.
BURNS
Bah! No time! Next!
SMITHERS
I have some sad news to report. A small puppy, not unlike Lassie, was just run over in the parking lot. (audience gasp) And now it's time for the comedy stylings of Homer Simpson!
Homer comes on stage.
HOMER
(loudly) Are you ready to laugh?
MAN
Poor dog.
HOMER
(loudly) I said, are you ready to laugh?
WOMAN
Quiet, you awful man!
HOMER
You know, Mr. Burns is so cheap!
BURNS
What?
HOMER
I mean, y'know, Mr. Burns is so old!
BURNS
How dare you!
HOMER
(to himself) Whoo, tough crowd. Better bring out the big guns. (to audience) Here's an impression of Mr. Burns that you might find a little . . . cheeky!
He turns round, bends over and drops his pants to reveal a face painted on his butt. He wiggles his butt to the crowd.
HOMER
(mimicking) I'm Mr. Burns! Blah blah blah! I think I'm so big, blah blah blah! Do this, do that, blah blah blah!
BURNS
Destroy him.
Several guards approach him, wielding clubs.
HOMER
Bla bla bla---(a guard hits him) Ow!
BURNS
This party is over!
A riot squad enters the room and causes chaos.
Back at the Simpsons' home. Homer has a lump on his head.
HOMER
Oh, where did I lose 'em? I'll never wiggle my bare butt in public again.
LISA
I'd like to believe that this time, I really would.
MARGE
Bart, run down to the store and get a bag of ice for your father's head.
BART
Yes'm. (He turns to Homer) Dad, I know you're discouraged, but please don't deny the world your fat can.
HOMER
Don't worry boy, she'll be ready for your Aunt Selma's birthday.
LISA
I knew it...
At Burns's mansion, Smithers tries to comfort Burns.
SMITHERS
Look at all the wonderful things you have, sir: King Arthur's Excalibur; the only existing nude photo of Mark Twain; and that rare first draft of the constitution with the word ""suckers"" in it.
BURNS
Yes yes yes, so what?
SMITHERS
You want your Bobo, don't you?
BURNS
Liar! I'll give you the thrashing of a lifetime! (He tries, but is too feeble.) Resistance is futile! (He falls into Smithers arms.) Oh God, how I want my bear. But he's gone, gone forever. I'd give anything to know what happened to him.
The next few scenes follow Bobo's journey. The bear remains in the snow where it was dropped. When the snow melts, the bear is swept into the river. It is picked up in 1927 by a man who gives it to Charles Lindberg.
MAN
Why, put some grease in your garter, Lindy, you're late!
Lindberg flies off in a plane. He passes over Germany where a young Adolf Hitler catches Bobo as it falls. Later, in 1947, Hitler is in a bunker, while Germany is being bombed. He picks up the bear.
HITLER
This is all your fault!
He throws the bear outside. Next we see it in 1957, atop a submarine about to dive. Bobo becomes frozen in a block of ice, and is dug up in the Arctic in the present day. He is packed into a bag of ice, and put in a van. The van then arrives at the Kwik-E-Mart, and the men unload the bags of ice.
MAN
You've gotta start selling this for more than a dollar a bag. We lost four more men on this expedition.
APU
If you can think of a better way to get ice, I'd like to hear it.
The men chatter, unable to think of one.
MAN
Beats me.
Bart picks up a bag.
BART
Hey Apu, this bag of ice has a head in it.
APU
Ooh, a head bag! Those are choc-full of... heady goodness!
Bart opens the bag back at home and pulls out Bobo.
BART
Hey, it's a teddy bear. Ugh, gross, it's probably diseased or something. Here Maggie.
He gives the bear to Maggie. A close up of the bear shows a ""100% COTTON"" label, and then a label marked ""Bobo"".

ACT TWO
At Burns's mansion, Smithers enters wearing a bear costume.
SMITHERS
Here's something that should cheer you up, sir. It's me sir, Bobo! (He sits on Burns's lap) Hug me, squeeze me, tug at my fur!
BURNS
(pushes him off) Ugh, enough! Stop this grotesque charade. Now find my teddy! (as Smithers leaves) Oh and, er, leave the costume.
Kent Brockman delivers the news. Homer watches, while Maggie plays with Bobo in front of him.
KENT BROCKMAN
The Burns bear, perhaps the most valuable widdle bear in the world, could be anywhere. It could be in your house... You could be looking at it right now. (Maggie holds up the bear) It could be right in front of your face as I'm saying this, waggling back and forth, perhaps being held up by a loved one.
HOMER
Maggie, I'm trying to watch TV. Put that moldy old bear down. (he gasps) Moldy? Old? I'm gonna get something to eat!
Professor Frink has invented a robot bear for Mr. Burns.
FRINK
Well, it's not your original bear, of course, ng-hee, but it is programmed to be just as cuddly.
He turns it on using a remote control, but the bear seems to be evil. It grabs Burns.
FRINK
(messing with remote) Doggone it. It's supposed to be doing a little dance...
SMITHERS
I got it!
He smashes a chair over the bear's head.
FRINK
I'll try to turn it off...
BEAR
No, bear want to live! Aah!
The bear breaks through the wall to Burns's mansion.
While Lisa meditates to sea music in the living room, Maggie places the bear behind the fish tank. Bart knocks over a lamp which shines eerily onto the tank. At the top of the stairs, Homer trips on Bart's skateboard and falls down the stairs, hitting his head several times on the way down.
HOMER
Ah! D'oh! Ow! Son of a... D'oh! Stupid... stair!
Upon reaching the bottom, he notices the fish tank.
HOMER
(gasp) How long have we had these fish? (gasp) Wait, it's a bear... Burns's bear!
The family sit round the kitchen table with the bear. Lisa checks the label.
LISA
Bobo. It's Mr. Burns's bear all right.
HOMER
Well Burns isn't getting this back cheap. He's gonna have to give me... my own recording studio.
He imagines himself singing with a brass ensemble.
HOMER
Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame-seed bun... (starts to drool) oh...
TECHNICIAN
Homer, you're drooling on the mike again.
Back to reality, and Homer is still drooling.
LISA
I think we should just give him the bear he cherishes so much.
Homer and Bart burst out laughing. Marge inspects the bear.
MARGE
Hmm... better sew that eye back on.
BART
No, let's send Burns the eye in the mail. He'll pay more money if he thinks the bear's in danger.
HOMER
(in a trance) Yes, we'll send the eye.
MARGE
I'm sure he'll offer us a fair reward. (pause) And then we'll make him double it!
FAMILY
Huh?
MARGE
Well why can't I be greedy once in a while?
Homer takes the bear to Mr. Burns.
BURNS
Bobo, my beautiful Bobo. I promise I'll never leave you behind again. (Homer coughs) Ah, yes. Er, naturally I can't pay you much of a reward because I'm strapped for cash.
The ceiling collapses, covering him in gold coins and jewels.
BURNS
As you can see, this old place is falling apart. But, I'm sure we can come to an understanding.
HOMER
Yes, sir. (pan up to his brain) Reject the first offer. Reject the first offer.
BURNS
May I offer you a drink?
HOMER
Sorry, Burns, no deal!
Homer takes the bear and leaves.
BURNS
Don't worry Smithers. He's playing hardball now, but it won't take him long to crack.
Homer is sat at home. A cracking noise is heard, and Homer lunges for the phone.
HOMER
I gotta call Burns, I gotta call Burns! Maybe I can still get that drink!
BART
(putting the phone down) Dad, the longer he has to wait, the more he'll pay.
HOMER
Right, that makes sense.
He suddenly dives onto the phone and tries to dial, but the whole family, including the pets, pull him back. A knock is heard at the door. Homer answers with the family still holding onto him. It's Burns.<,i>
HOMER
I knew you'd come crawling back.
BURNS
(inside) How much do you want?
HOMER
A million dollars and three Hawaiian islands. Good ones, not the leper one.
BURNS
Done! Now give me that bear!
HOMER
Woohoo! I'm rich! Rich I tells ya! Here you go!
Homer tries to pick up the bear, but Maggie is holding onto it.
HOMER
(struggling) It seems to be caught on something... Bad baby! Bad Maggie!
He finally wrestles it out of Maggie grasp, but she starts crying. Homer is unsure what to do.
BURNS
Give me the bear!
SMITHERS
The bear! The bear!
Homer gives the bear back to Maggie.
HOMER
Here you go, Maggie. The deal's off, Mr. Burns. The bear stays here.
BURNS
You've made a mistake, Simpson!
Smithers growls as they both leave.
HOMER
Big deal! Who needs his money? We're getting along fine.
Suddenly, Abe crashes a car through the wall of the Simpsons' home.
ABE
Son, you gotta help me! I hit three people on the way over here, and I don't have any insurance! (pause) So, how's my Ute?

ACT THREE
It is night-time. Burns and Smithers stand atop Flanders' roof, dressed in black. Smithers shoots an arrow attached to a wire onto the Simpsons' roof.
BURNS
Excellent shot, Smithers. I'll be squeezing my Bobo in no time.
Flanders pops his head out of the attic window.
FLANDERS
Howdy, gents, what can I diddily-do ya for?
Burns sprays something in his face, and he faints.
BURNS
Remember Smithers. In and out in eighteen seconds.
They slide down the wire, but get stuck in the middle. They stay there until morning when the firemen rescue them. Burns is sitting in an ambulance, wrapped in a blanket.
MARGE
More cocoa, Mr. Burns?
BURNS
Yes.
The next night. Burns and Smithers get into the house, and crawl along the ceiling using suction pads. They are halfway across the kitchen when Homer, half asleep and in his underwear, enters and takes some cheese out of the fridge. He sits down at the table.
HOMER
Mmm... sixty four slices of American cheese. (starts eating them) Sixty four... sixty three...
Fade to morning, and he is struggling to finish.
HOMER
Two... One...
MARGE
(entering) Homer, have you been up all night eating cheese?
HOMER
I think I'm blind.
Burns and Smithers lose suction in their pads and fall to the floor. They get up quickly and brush themselves off.
HOMER
Wha?
BURNS
Good day to you. (exit)
At work the next day, fellow workmates gather round him.
MAN 1
Excuse me, we wanted to see the geek who valued the happiness of his children more than money.
HOMER
(bored) Right here.
MAN 2
Aw, you said his head was the size of a baseball.
HOMER
Oh, my life can't get any worse.
SMITHERS
(over the tannoy) Homer Simpson, report for much worse duties.
HOMER
D'oh!
Homer's ""much worse"" duty consists of him walking in a circle in the basement, turning a large gear, while being whipped by an executioner.
HOMER
(whip) Ow! (whip) D'oh! After lunch, can I whip you?
EXECUTIONER
No.
HOMER
Oh, no fair.(whip) Ow!
The view pans up a long way to the cafeteria, where Homer's efforts simply rotate a display of cakes. Lenny and Carl pass by.
LENNY
Mmm, I wonder what makes it turn.
CARL
Who cares?
Back at home again. Homer tries to coax the bear away from Maggie.
HOMER
Maggie, I know you like the bear, but wouldn't you be just as happy playing with... (looks around, and picks up a cardboard box) this box! (plays with it) See Maggie? See the fun box? Do-do-do-do-do-do!
Maggie reaches for the box.
HOMER
No! My box! My box!
He runs to the other side of the room and plays by himself. Later in the bedroom, Marge enters from the en suite, her hair in a mess.
MARGE
Mmm, I think we need a new hairdryer.
HOMER
Marge, you must hate me for not taking Mr. Burns's money.
MARGE
I don't hate you, I'm proud of you! You came through for your daughter when she needed you the most.
HOMER
Aw, thanks Marge. But it'll take a lot more than that to comfort this tortured sole. (he picks up his box) Hee boxy!
MARGE
(snatching the box) Gimme that!
HOMER
Aw...
Homer watches Barney the Dinosaur on TV.
BARNEY
Two plus two is four, two plus two is four, two plus two is four...
HOMER
(chuckling) I can see why this show is so popular. Look at him. Heh.
Suddenly, the program is cut off and Mr. Burns appears on screen.
BURNS
Give me my bear, Simpson!
HOMER
Aah!
He changes channels.
TV PRESENTER
It's the sooooouuuul mass transit system!
Burns rushes on screen, panting.
BURNS
(out of breath) Give it to me!
Homer changes channel again. This time the Spanish Bee is playing with an oversized yoyo.
SPANISH BEE
Ay, el yoyo is grande!
Burns runs on screen and pushes the bee out of the way.
SPANISH BEE
Ay, chihuahua!
BURNS
As you can see, Simpson, I have taken over all 78 channels. And you won't see any of your favorite shows again until you give in.
OTTO
(driving the bus and watching TV) Whoa, that bites.
PATTY
(gasp) Holy crap!
BURNS
What's that you say? You can live without television so long as you have beer?
HOMER
That's right.
BURNS
Wrong. All beer trucks heading towards Springfield have been diverted. This town will be as dry as a bone. And if the rest of you beer-swilling tube-jockeys out there have a problem with this, talk to Homer Simpson. (laughs evilly)
The doorbell then rings. It is Barney. He points a gun at Homer.
BARNEY
Homer, give him what he wants!
HOMER
Oh Barney, leave me alone!
He slams the door in Barney's face.
BARNEY
Whoops!
He is heard falling backwards. A shot is fired, smashing glass is heard, then a woman screaming, then a police siren.
BARNEY
Uh-oh.
Bart is at school, surrounded by bullies.
NELSON
My old man can't get a beer because his old man won't give a bear to another old man. Let's get him!
JIMBO
Wait! Why are we gettin' him?
MARTIN
(coming into the shot) Look, fellas. The first snapdragon of the season!
NELSON
Never mind. Let's just get him!
JIMBO
Yeah!
They chase after Martin, knocking Bart over as they run.
A sitcom starring Burns and Smithers is on TV. Burns enters a house
BURNS
Smithers, I'm home! (canned laughter)
SMITHERS
What, already? (more laughter)
BURNS
Yes! (louder laughing)
LISA
Is it my imagination, or is TV getting worse.
HOMER
Eh, it's about the same. Uh-oh! Look out Smithers!
The sound of smashing glass can be heard, along with more canned laughter. Homer laughs.
HOMER
Heh heh. I love this show.
An angry mob appear outside the Simpsons' front window.
HOMER
Well, well, look who's come to apologize.
MOE
(outside) Come on, let's go in there and get the bear!
The crowd cheers and storms the house.
MOE
Ha! Got it!
Moe takes Bobo from Maggie and it is passed towards the door. The mob starts to leave, but see Maggie crying.
MOE
Aw jeez, would you look at that.
JASPER
What have we become?
DR. HIBBERT
We've given the word ""mob"" a bad name.
They pass the bear back, and go outside.
MOE
Well, what should we do now?
SKINNER
Hey everyone! Let's go sing at the hospital!
The crowd cheers and walks off, singing.
CROWD
For we've got high hopes,
We've got high hopes...
Later. The doorbell rings. It is Mr. Burns.
BURNS
Simpson, look what you've reduced me to.
He clicks his fingers, and Smithers enters on his knees, begging.
SMITHERS
Please! Please!
HOMER
But Mr. Burns, it's not my bear, it's Maggie's.
Burns goes to the back garden, where Maggie is playing in the sandpit. Maggie instinctively grabs Bobo.
BURNS
So, good sand today, hmm? (Maggie offers him her pacifier) Oh, well, I don't usually, but...
As he puts it in his mouth, a photographer appears on the other side of the fence and takes a photo.
BURNS
Damn you paparazzo! (He throws the pacifier down.) Well, Maggie, I've given this a lot of thought. I'm sure we can come to some sort of agreement--
He suddenly lunges for the bear, but is too weak to take it from Maggie.
BURNS
Beaten by an infant... what could be more humiliating?
PHOTOGRAPHER
(takes a photo) What a scoop!
BURNS
Okay, Maggie, you win. But I want you to do something for me. Hang onto that bear. Don't make the same mistake I made.
He sighs, then gets up and walks away. He doesn't get very far when Maggie offers him Bobo back.
BURNS
For me? Bobo? Smithers, I'm so happy. Something amazing has happened, I'm actually happy. Take a note! From now on, I'm only going to be good and kind to everyone.
SMITHERS
I'm sorry sir, I don't have a pencil.
BURNS
Oh, don't worry, I'm sure I'll remember it.
The family watch Burns and Smithers walk off.
HOMER
Well, we didn't get any money, but Mr. Burns got what he wanted. Marge, I'm confused. Is this a happy ending or a sad ending?
MARGE
It's an ending, that's enough.
Smithers tucks Mr. Burns into bed.
SMITHERS
There you go.
BURNS
Ah, Bobo, reunited at last. But I can't help but wonder what the future holds for you. (yawning) Ah yes, wonder...
He falls asleep. In his dream, the year is 1,000,000 A.D., and apes are using several Homers as slaves, whipping them as they pull carts.
HOMER SLAVES
D'oh! D'oh!
Some apes dig up a pile of rocks, under which is Bobo. A robotic arm takes the bear, which is revealed to be Mr. Burns's head in a jar, with a robot body.
BURNS ROBOT
Bobo, I know I say this every century, but I'll never leave you behind again.
He runs off into the distance, and is followed by Smithers as a robot dog.
SMITHERS ROBOT
Wait for me, sir! Woof!
Fade to credits."

Ano pa ba'ng hinihintay?

Halika na rito, 'wag magtampo
Makakarating tayo

Binigay ko na ang lahat sa'yo
Ano pa ang gusto mo?
Pinapagod mo ako

Verse 1 (Price):
I bet this tape here gone have all you rappers fallin’ short
Through these illustrations I sent them back to the drawing board
Don’t lay next to your enemy please watch who you fallin’ for
‘Cause if you from the ghetto its certain pain that we’ve all еndure
You playin’ possum waitin’ around for a possibly

See I got seeds I gotta fe

I got truths inside that the law could never get out of me
So
F**K
Those who doubted me
And the ones that killed all my people for learning how to read
I’m a CLRD King you can’t let ‘em change your perception
I was thought a loss you just gotta make i
T a lesson
I was thought mistakes is better than faking perfection you dig
If you don’t own nothin’ don’t make no suggestions
You probably ignore your GPS how you hate takin’ direction you dig
This for the WEST and all the greats in my section you dig

Tryna find a love song to dedicate to my shorty
My lil brother Zay helped me count up my first $40
Now it’s my early 20’s, instead I stacked plenty
First deal, made Interscope millions and only touched pennies
That just made me up my level in business now I can’t settle
Low top Vans inside this Benz plus she with me to beat the devil
Tell my fans when they come to my shows bring rose pedals
That’s how I know y’all really ready for my...

180,137569878,Patay Sindi,Stellar,[20],['Alternative'],"Es war ein dunkler Tag in Dallas, November '63
Ein Tag, der in Schande weiterleben wird
Präsident Kennedy war an der Spitze
Guter Tag zum Leben und ein guter Tag zum Sterben
Wurde wie ein Opferlamm zum Schlachten geführt
Er sagte: „Moment mal, Jungs, wisst ihr wer ich bin?“
„Natürlich wissen wir, wer du bist!“
Dann haben sie ihm den Kopf weggeblasen, als er noch im Auto war
Am helllichten Tag wie einen Hund abgeschossen
War eine Frage des Zeitpunkts und der Zeitpunkt war richtig
Du hast unbezahlte Schulden, wir sind gekommen, um sie einzutreiben
Wir werden dich mit Hass töten, ohne Respekt
Wir werden dich verspotten und schockieren und wir werden es dir ins Gesicht sagen
Wir haben bereits jemanden hier, der deinen Platz einnimmt
An dem Tag, als sie das Gehirn des Königs wegblasen
Tausende sahen zu, niemand sah etwas
Es geschah so schnell, so schnell, überraschend
Genau dort vor allen Augen
Größter Zaubertrick jemals unter der Sonne
Perfekt ausgeführt, geschickt gemacht
Wolfsmann, oh Wolfsmann, oh Wolfsmann heule
Trommelwirbel, es ist der übelste Mord

Still, kleine Kinder, ihr werdet verstehen
Die Beatles kommen, sie werden deine Hand halten
Rutsche das Geländer herunter und hole deinen Mantel
Überquere die Mersey mit der Fähre und geh an die Gurgel
Dort sind drei Landstreicher, alle in Lumpen gekleidet
Nimm die Einzelteile und senke die Fahnen
Ich gehe nach Woodstock, es ist das Wassermannzeitalter
Dann gehe ich nach Altamont und setze mich nah an die Bühne
Steck deinen Kopf aus dem Fenster, lass die guten Zeiten laufen
Hinter dem Grassy Knoll findet eine Party statt
Stapeln Sie die Ziegel, gießen Sie den Zement
Sagen Sie nicht, dass Dallas Sie nicht liebt, Mr. President
Setzen deinen Fuß in den Tank und trete aufs Gas
Versuche es bis zur dreifachen Unterführung zu schaffen
Blackface-Sänger, Whiteface-Clown
Zeigt eure Gesichter besser nicht, nachdem die Sonne untergegangen ist
Oben im Rotlichtviertel haben sie den Polizist besiegt
Leben in einem Albtraum in der Elm Street
Wenn du unten in Deep Ellum bist, steck dein Geld in deinen Schuh
Frage nicht, was dein Land für dich tun kann
Bargeld auf dem Stimmzettel, Geld zum Verbrennen
Dealey Plaza, biege links ab
Ich gehe runter zur Kreuzung, werde per Anhalter fahren
Der Ort, an dem Glaube, Hoffnung und Nächstenliebe liegen
Erschieß ihn, während er rennt, Junge, erschieß ihn, solange du kannst
Sieh, ob du den unsichtbaren Mann erschießen kannst
Auf Wiedersehen, Charlie! Auf Wiedersehen, Onkel Sam!
Ehrlich gesagt, Miss Scarlett, ist mir das egal
Was ist die Wahrheit und wohin ist sie gegangen?
Frage Oswald und Ruby, sie müssten es wissen
„Halt den Mund“, sagte eine weise alte Eule
Geschäft ist Geschäft, es ist der übelste Mord
Tommy, kannst du mich hören? Ich bin die Säurekönigin
Ich fahre in einer langen schwarzen Lincoln-Limousine
Fahre auf dem Rücksitz neben meiner Frau
Auf dem direkten Weg ins Jenseits
Ich lehne mich nach links, ich habe meinen Kopf in ihrem Schoß
Moment mal, ich bin in eine Art Falle geführt worden
Wo wir keinen Vierteldollar verlangen, wo wir keinen Vierteldollar geben
Wir sind gleich die Straße runter, von der Straße, in der du lebst
Sie verstümmelten seinen Körper und nahmen sein Gehirn
Was konnten sie noch tun? Sie häuften den Schmerz an
Aber seine Seele war nicht da, wo sie sein sollte
In den letzten fünfzig Jahren haben sie danach gesucht
Freiheit, oh Freiheit, Freiheit über mich
Ich hasse es, es Ihnen zu sagen, Herr, aber nur Tote sind frei
Schick mir etwas Liebe, dann erzähl mir keine Lüge
Wirf die Waffe in die Gosse und gehe vorbei
Wach auf, kleine Susie, lass uns einen Ausflug machen
Überqueren den Trinity River und lass uns die Hoffnung am Leben erhalten
Schalte das Radio ein und berühre nicht die Wählscheiben
Parkland Krankenhaus, nur noch sechs Meilen
Du hast mich schwindelig gemacht, Miss Lizzy, du hast mich mit Blei gefüllt
Deine magische Kugel ist in meinen Kopf gegangen
Ich bin nur ein Sündenbock wie Patsy Cline
Habe niemals jemanden von vorne oder hinten erschossen
Ich habe Blut im Auge, habe Blut im Ohr
Ich werde es nie bis zur neuen Grenze schaffen
Zapruders Film, den ich am Abend zuvor gesehen habe
Ich habe es dreiunddreißig Mal gesehen, vielleicht öfter
Es ist gemein und betrügerisch, es ist grausam und es ist gemein
Das Hässlichste, was du je gesehen hast
Sie haben ihn einmal getötet und sie haben ihn zweimal getötet
Töteten ihn wie ein Menschenopfer
An dem Tag, als sie ihn töteten, sagte jemand zu mir: „Sohn“
„Das Zeitalter des Antichristen hat gerade erst begonnen“
Air Force One kommt durch das Tor herein
Johnson vereidigte um 2:38
Lass mich wissen, wenn du dich entscheidest, das Handtuch zu werfen
Es ist, was es ist, und es ist der übelste Mord
Was gibt es neues, Pussycat? Was würde ich sagen?
Ich sagte, die Seele einer Nation sei weggerissen worden
Und es beginnt langsam zu verfallen
Und dass es sechsunddreißig Stunden nach dem Jüngsten Gericht ist
Wolfman Jack, er spricht in Zungen
Er macht weiter und weiter, voller Inbrunst
Spielen sie mir ein Lied, Mr. Wolfman Jack
Spiel es für mich in meinem langen Cadillac
Spiel mir „Only the Good Die Young“

Bring es bis zum Limit und lass es vorbeigehen
Spiel es auch für Carl Wilson
Schaue weit, weit weg, die Gower Avenue hinunter
Spiel Tragödie, spiel „Twilight Time“
Bring mich zurück nach Tulsa, zum Tatort
Spiel einen anderen und „Another One Bites the Dust“
Spiel „The Old Rugged Cross“ und „In God We Trust“
Reite mit dem rosa Pferd die lange, einsame Straße hinunter
Steh da und warte, bis sein Kopf explodiert
Spiel „Mystery Train“ für Mr. Mystery
Der Mann, der tot umfiel wie ein wurzelloser Baum
Spiel es für den Pfarrer, spiel es für den Pastor
Spiel es für den Hund, der kein Herrchen hat
Spiel Oscar Peterson, spiel Stan Getz
Spiel „Blue Sky“, spiel Dickey Betts
Spiel Art Pepper, Thelonious Monk
Charlie Parker und all diesen Müll
All diesen Müll und „All That Jazz“
Spiel etwas für den Birdman of Alcatraz
Spiel Buster Keaton, spiel Harold Lloyd
Spiel Bugsy Siegel, spiel Pretty Boy Floyd
Spiel die Zahlen, spiel um die Chance
Spiel „Cry Me A River“ für den Herrn der Götter
Spiel Nummer neun, spiel Nummer sechs
Spiel es für Lindsey und Stevie Nicks
Spiel Nat King Cole, spiel „Nature Boy“
Spiel „Down In The Boondocks“ für Terry Malloy
Spiel „It Happened One Night“ und „One Night of Sin“
Es sind zwölf Millionen Seelen, die zuhören
Spiel „Merchant of Venice“, spiel „Merchants of Death“
Spiel „Stella by Starlight“ für Lady Macbeth
Machen sie sich keine Sorgen, Herr Präsident, Hilfe ist unterwegs
Ihre Brüder kommen, es wird viel zu bezahlen geben
Brüder? Welche Brüder? Was ist das mit der Hölle?
Sagen sie ihnen: „Wir warten, kommen sie weiter.“ Wir werden sie auch bekommen
In Love Field landete sein Flugzeug
Aber es hob nie wieder ab
Es war schwer zu folgen, unübertroffen
Sie töteten ihn auf dem Altar der aufgehenden Sonne
Spiel „Misty“ für mich und „That Old Devil Moon“
Spiel „Anything Goes“ und „Memphis in June“
Spiel „Lonely At the Top“ und „Lonely Are the Brave“
Spiel es für Houdini, der sich um sein Grab dreht
Spiel Jelly Roll Morton, spiel „Lucille“

189,121314490,Amnesia (Acoustic),Grace Note,"[20, 14, 1133]","['Alternative', 'Pop', 'Pop/Rock']","What parallel courses did Bloom and Stephen follow returning?
Starting united both at normal walking pace from Beresford place they followed in the order named Lower and Middle Gardiner streets and Mountjoy square, west: then, at reduced pace, each bearing left, Gardiner's place by an inadvertance as far as the farther corner of Temple street, north: then at reduced pace with interruptions of halt, bearing right, Temple street, north, as far as Hardwicke place. Approaching, disparate, at relaxed walking pace they crossed both the circus before George's church diametrically, the chord in any circle being less than the arc which it subtends.
Of what did the duumvirate deliberate during their itinerary?
Music, literature, Ireland, Dublin, Paris, friendship, woman, prostitution, diet, the influence of gaslight or the light of arc and glow-lamps on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees, exposed corporation emergency dustbuckets, the Roman catholic church, ecclesiastical celibacy, the Irish nation, jesuit education, careers, the study of medicine, the past day, the maleficent influence of the presabbath, Stephen's collapse.
Did Bloom discover common factors of similarity between their respective like and unlike reactions to experience?
Both were sensitive to artistic impressions musical in preference to plastic or pictorial. Both preferred a continental to an insular manner of life, a cisatlantic to a transatlantic place of residence. Both indurated by early domestic training and an inherited tenacity of heterodox resistance professed their disbelief in many orthodox religious, national, social and ethical doctrines. Both admitted the alternately stimulating and obtunding influence of heterosexual magnetism.
Were their views on some points divergent?
Stephen dissented openly from Bloom's view on the importance of dietary and civic self help while Bloom dissented tacitly from Stephen's views on the eternal affirmation of the spirit of man in literature. Bloom assented covertly to Stephen's rectification of the anachronism involved in assigning the date of the conversion of the Irish nation to christianity from druidism by Patrick son of Calpornus, son of Potitus, son of Odyssus, sent by pope Celestine I in the year 432 in the reign of Leary to the year 260 or thereabouts in the reign of Cormac MacArt (266 A.D.) suffocated by imperfect deglutition of aliment at Sletty and interred at Rossnaree. The collapse which Bloom ascribed to gastric inanition and certain chemical compounds of varying degrees of adulteration and alcoholic strength, accelerated by mental exertion and the velocity of rapid circular motion in a relaxing atmosphere, Stephen attributed to the reapparition of a matutinal cloud (perceived by both from two different points of observation, Sandycove and Dublin) at first no bigger than a woman's hand.
Was there one point on which their views were equal and negative?
The influence of gaslight or electric light on the growth of adjoining paraheliotropic trees.
Had Bloom discussed similar subjects during nocturnal perambulations in the past?
In 1884 with Ower Goldberg and Cecil Turnbull at night on public thoroughfares between Longwood avenue and Leonard's corner and Leonard's corner and Synge street and Synge street and Bloomfield avenue. In 1885 with Percy Apjohn in the evenings, reclined against the wall between Gibraltar villa and Bloomfield house in Crumlin, barony of Uppercross. In 1886 occasionally with casual acquaintances and prospective purchasers on doorsteps, in front parlours, in third class railway carriages of suburban lines. In 1888 frequently with major Brian Tweedy and his daughter Miss Marion Tweedy, together and separately on the lounge in Matthew Dillon's house in Roundtown. Once in 1892 and once in 1893 with Julius Mastiansky, on both occasions in the parlour of his (Bloom's) house in Lombard street, west.
What reflection concerning the irregular sequence of dates 1884, 1885, 1886, 1888, 1892, 1893, 1904 did Bloom make before their arrival at their destination?
He reflected that the progressive extension of the field of individual development and experience was regressively accompanied by a restriction of the converse domain of interindividual relations.
As in what ways?
From inexistence to existence he came to many and was as one received: existence with existence he was with any as any with any: from existence to nonexistence gone he would be by all as none perceived.
What action did Bloom make on their arrival at their destination?
At the housesteps of the 4th of the equidifferent uneven numbers, number 7 Eccles street, he inserted his hand mechanically into the back pocket of his trousers to obtain his latchkey.
Was it there?
It was in the corresponding pocket of the trousers which he had worn on the day but one preceding.
Why was he doubly irritated?
Because he had forgotten and because he remembered that he had reminded himself twice not to forget.
What were then the alternatives before the, premeditatedly (respectively) and inadvertently, keyless couple?
To enter or not to enter. To knock or not to knock.
Bloom's decision?
A stratagem. Resting his feet on the dwarf wall, he climbed over the area railings, compressed his hat on his head, grasped two points at the lower union of rails and stiles, lowered his body gradually by its length of five feet nine inches and a half to within two feet ten inches of the area pavement, and allowed his body to move freely in space by separating himself from the railings and crouching in preparation for the impact of the fall.
Did he fall?
By his body's known weight of eleven stone and four pounds in avoirdupois measure, as certified by the graduated machine for periodical selfweighing in the premises of Francis Fraedman, pharmaceutical chemist of 19 Frederick street, north, on the last feast of the Ascension, to wit, the twelfth day of May of the bissextile year one thousand nine hundred and four of the Christian era (jewish era five thousand six hundred and sixtyfour, mohammedan era one thousand three hundred and twentytwo), golden number $, epact 13, solar cycle 9, dominical letters C B, Roman indication 2, Julian period 6617, MXMIV.
Did he rise uninjured by concussion?
Regaining new stable equilibrium he rose uninjured though concussed by the impact, raised the latch of the area door by the exertion of force at its freely moving flange and by leverage of the first kind applied at its fulcrum gained retarded access to the kitchen through the subadjacent scullery, ignited a Lucifer match by friction, set free inflammable coal gas by turning on the ventcock, lit a high flame which, by regulating, he reduced to quiescent candescence and lit finally a portable candle.
What discrete succession of images did Stephen meanwhile perceive?
Reclined against the area railings he perceived through the transparent kitchen panes a man regulating a gasflame of 14 C P, a man lighting a candle, a man removing in turn each of his two boots, a man leaving the kitchen holding a candle of ICP.
Did the man reappear elsewhere?
Alter a lapse of four minutes the glimmer of his candle was discernible through the semitransparent semicircular glass fanlight over the halldoor. The halldoor turned gradually on its hinges. In the open space of the doorway the man reappeared without his hat, with his candle.
Did Stephen obey his sign?
Yes, entering softly, he helped to close and chain the door and followed softly along the hallway the man's back and listed feet and lighted candle past a lighted crevice of doorway on the left and carefully down a turning staircase of more than five steps into the kitchen of Bloom's house.
What did Bloom do?
He extinguished the candle by a sharp expiration of breath upon its flame, drew two spoonseat deal chairs to the hearthstone, one for Stephen with its back to the area window, the other for himself when necessary, knelt on one knee, composed in the grate a pyre of crosslaid resintipped sticks and various coloured papers and irregular polygons of best Abram coal at twentyone shillings a ton from the yard of Messrs Flower and M'Donald of 14 D'Olier street, kindled it at three projecting points of paper with one ignited lucifer match, thereby releasing the potential energy contained in the fuel by allowing its carbon and hydrogen elements to enter into free union with the oxygen of the air.
Of what similar apparitions did Stephen think?
Of others elsewhere in other times who, kneeling on one knee or on two, had kindled fires for him, of Brother Michael in the infirmary of the college of the Society of Jesus at Clongowes Wood, Sallins, in the county of Kildare: of his father, Simon Dedalus, in an unfurnished room of his first residence in Dublin, number thirteen Fitzgibbon street: of his godmother Miss Kate Morkan in the house of her dying sister Miss Julia Morkan at 15 Usher's Island: of his mother Mary, wife of Simon Dedalus, in the kitchen of number twelve North Richmond street on the morning of the feast of Saint Francis-Xavier 1898: of the dean of studies, Father Butt, in the physics' theatre of university College, 16 Stephen's green, north: of his sister Dilly (Delia) in his father's house in Cabra.
What did Stephen see on raising his gaze to the height of a yard from the fire towards the opposite wall?
Under a row of five coiled spring housebells a curvilinear rope, stretched between two holdfasts athwart across the recess beside the chimney pier, from which hung four smallsized square handkerchiefs folded unattached consecutively in adjacent rectangles and one pair of ladies' grey hose with lisle suspendertops and feet in their habitual position clamped by three erect wooden pegs two at their outer extremities and the third at their point of junction.
What did Bloom see on the range?
On the right (smaller) hob a blue enamelled saucepan: on the left (larger) hob a black iron kettle.
What did Bloom do at the range?
He removed the saucepan to the left hob, rose and carried the iron kettle to the sink in order to tap the current by turning the faucet to let it flow.
Did it flow?
Yes. From Roundwood reservoir in county Wicklow of a cubic capacity of 2,400 million gallons, percolating through a subterranean aqueduct of filter mains of single and double pipeage constructed at an initial plant cost of #5 per linear yard by way of the Dargle, Rathdown, Glen of the Downs and Callowhill to the 26 acre reservoir at Stillorgan, a distance of 22 statute miles, and thence, through a system of relieving tanks, by a gradient of 250 feet to the city boundary at Eustace bridge, upper Leeson street, though from prolonged summer drouth and daily supply of 12 1/2 million gallons the water had fallen below the sill of the overflow weir for which reason the borough surveyor and waterworks engineer, Mr Spencer Harty, C.E., on the instructions of the waterworks committee, had prohibited the use of municipal water for purposes other than those of consumption (envisaging the possibility of recourse being had to the importable water of the Grand and Royal canals as in 1893) particularly as the South Dublin Guardians, notwithstanding their ration of 15 gallons per day per pauper supplied through a 6 inch meter, had been convicted of a wastage of 20,000 gallons per night by a reading of their meter on the affirmation of the law agent of the corporation, Mr Ignatius Rice, solicitor, thereby acting to the detriment of another section of the public, selfsupporting taxpayers, solvent, sound.
What in water did Bloom, waterlover, drawer of water, watercarrier returning to the range, admire?
Its universality: its democratic equality and constancy to its nature in seeking its own level: its vastness in the ocean of Mercator's projection: its umplumbed profundity in the Sundam trench of the Pacific exceeding 8,000 fathoms: the restlessness of its waves and surface particles visiting in turn all points of its seaboard: the independence of its units: the variability of states of sea: its hydrostatic quiescence in calm: its hydrokinetic turgidity in neap and spring tides: its subsidence after devastation: its sterility in the circumpolar icecaps, arctic and antarctic: its climatic and commercial significance: its preponderance of 3 to 1 over the dry land of the globe: its indisputable hegemony extending in square leagues over all the region below the subequatorial tropic of Capricorn: the multisecular stability of its primeval basin: its luteofulvous bed: Its capacity to dissolve and hold in solution all soluble substances including billions of tons of the most precious metals: its slow erosions of peninsulas and downwardtending promontories: its alluvial deposits: its weight and volume and density: its imperturbability in lagoons and highland tarns: its gradation of colours in the torrid and temperate and frigid zones: its vehicular ramifications in continental lakecontained streams and confluent oceanflowing rivers with their tributaries and transoceanic currents: gulfstream, north and south equatorial courses: its violence in seaquakes, waterspouts, artesian wells, eruptions, torrents, eddies, freshets, spates, groundswells, watersheds, waterpartings, geysers, cataracts, whirlpools, maelstroms, inundations, deluges, cloudbursts: its vast circumterrestrial ahorizontal curve: its secrecy in springs, and latent humidity, revealed by rhabdomantic or hygrometric instruments and exemplified by the hole in the wall at Ashtown gate, saturation of air, distillation of dew: the simplicity of its composition, two constituent parts of hydrogen with one constituent part of oxygen: its healing virtues: its buoyancy in the waters of the Dead Sea: its persevering penetrativeness in runnels, gullies, inadequate dams, leaks on shipboard: its properties for cleansing, quenching thirst and fire, nourishing vegetation: its infallibility as paradigm and paragon: its metamorphoses as vapour, mist, cloud, rain, sleet, snow, hail: its strength in rigid hydrants: its variety of forms in loughs and bays and gulfs and bights and guts and lagoons and atolls and archipelagos and sounds and fjords and minches and tidal estuaries and arms of sea: its solidity in glaciers, icebergs, icefloes: its docility in working hydraulic millwheels, turbines, dynamos, electric power stations, bleachworks, tanneries, scutchmills: its utility in canals, rivers, if navigable, floating and graving docks: its potentiality derivable from harnessed tides or watercourses falling from level to level: its submarine fauna and flora (anacoustic, photophobe) numerically, if not literally, the inhabitants of the globe: its ubiquity as constituting 90% of the human body: the noxiousness of its effluvia in lacustrine marshes, pestilential fens, faded flowerwater, stagnant pools in the waning moon.
Having set the halffilled kettle on the now burning coals, why did he return to the stillflowing tap?
To wash his soiled hands with a partially consumed tablet of Barrington's lemonflavoured soap, to which paper still adhered (bought thirteen hours previously for fourpence and still unpaid for), in fresh cold neverchanging everchanging water and dry them, face and hands, in a long redbordered holland cloth passed over a wooden revolving roller.
What reason did Stephen give for declining Bloom's offer?
That he was hydrophobe, hating partial contact by immersion or total by submersion in cold water (his last bath having taken place in the month of October of the preceding year), disliking the aqueous substances of glass and crystal, distrusting aquacities of thought and language.
What impeded Bloom from giving Stephen counsels of hygiene and prophylactic to which should be added suggestions concerning a preliminary wetting of the head and contraction of the muscles with rapid splashing of the face and neck and thoracic and epigastric region in case of sea or river bathing, the parts of the human anatomy most sensitive to cold being the nape, stomach, and thenar or sole of foot?
The incompatibility of aquacity with the erratic originality of genius.
What additional didactic counsels did he similarly repress?
Dietary: concerning the respective percentage of protein and caloric energy in bacon, salt ling and butter, the absence of the former in the lastnamed and the abundance of the latter in the firstnamed.
Which seemed to the host to be the predominant qualities of his guest?
Confidence in himself, an equal and opposite power of abandonment and recuperation.
What concomitant phenomenon took place in the vessel of liquid by the agency of fire?
The phenomenon of ebullition. Fanned by a constant updraught of ventilation between the kitchen and the chimneyflue, ignition was communicated from the faggots of precombustible fuel to polyhedral masses of bituminous coal, containing in compressed mineral form the foliated fossilised decidua of primeval forests which had in turn derived their vegetative existence from the sun, primal source of heat (radiant), transmitted through omnipresent luminiferous diathermanous ether. Heat (convected), a mode of motion developed by such combustion, was constantly and increasingly conveyed from the source of calorification to the liquid contained in the vessel, being radiated through the uneven unpolished dark surface of the metal iron, in part reflected, in part absorbed, in part transmitted, gradually raising the temperature of the water from normal to boiling point, a rise in temperature expressible as the result of an expenditure of 72 thermal units needed to raise I pound of water from 50° to 212° Fahrenheit.
What announced the accomplishment of this rise in temperature?
A double falciform ejection of water vapour from under the kettlelid at both sides simultaneously.
For what personal purpose could Bloom have applied the water so boiled?
To shave himself.
What advantages attended shaving by night?
A softer beard: a softer brush if intentionally allowed to remain from shave to shave in its agglutinated lather: a softer skin if unexpectedly encountering female acquaintances in remote places at incustomary hours: quiet reflections upon the course of the day: a cleaner sensation when awaking after a fresher sleep since matutinal noises, premonitions and perturbations, a clattered milkcan, a postman's double knock, a paper read, reread while lathering, relathering the same spot, a shock, a shoot, with thought of aught he sought though fraught with nought might cause a faster rate of shaving and a nick on which incision plaster with precision cut and humected and applied adhered which was to be done.
Why did absence of light disturb him less than presence of noises
Because of the surety of the sense of touch in his firm full masculine feminine passive active hand.
What quality did it (his hand) possess but with what counteracting influence?
The operative surgical quality but that he was reluctant to shed human blood even when the end justified the means, preferring in their natural order, heliotherapy, psychophysicotherapeutics, osteopathic surgery.
What lay under exposure on the lower middle and upper shelves of the kitchen dresser opened by Bloom?
On the lower shelf five vertical breakfast plates, six horizontal breakfast saucers on which rested inverted breakfast cups, a moustachecup, uninverted, and saucer of Crown Derby, four white goldrimmed eggcups, and open shammy purse displaying coins, mostly copper, and a phial of aromatic violet comfits. On the middle shelf a chipped eggcup containing pepper, a drum of table salt, four conglomerated black olives in oleaginous paper, an empty pot of Plumtree's potted meat, an oval wicker basket bedded with fibre and containing one Jersey pear, a halfempty bottle of William Gilbey and Co's white invalid port, half disrobed of its swathe of coralpink tissue paper, a packet of Epps's soluble cocoa, five ounces of Anne Lynch's choice tea at 2/- per lb. in a crinkled leadpaper bag, a cylindrical canister containing the best crystallised lump sugar, two onions, one the larger, Spanish, entire, the other, smaller, Irish, bisected with augmented surface and more redolent, a jar of Irish Model Dairy's cream, a jug of brown crockery containing a noggin and a quarter of soured adulterated milk, converted by heat into water, acidulous serum and semisolidified curds, which added to the quantity subtracted for Mr Bloom's and Mrs Fleming's breakfasts made one imperial pint, the total quantity originally delivered, two cloves, a halfpenny and a small dish containing a slice of fresh ribsteak. On the upper shelf a battery of jamjars of various sizes and proveniences.
What attracted his attention lying on the apron of the dresser?
Four polygonal fragments of two lacerated scarlet betting tickets, numbered 887, 886.
What reminiscences temporarily corrugated his brow?
Reminiscences of coincidences, truth stranger than fiction, preindicative of the result of the Gold Cup flat handicap, the official and definitive result of which he had read in the Evening Telegraph, late pink edition, in the cabman's shelter, at Butt bridge.
Where had previous intimations of the result, effected or projected, been received by him?
In Bernard Kiernan's licensed premises 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street: in David Byrne's licensed premises, 14 Duke street: in O'Connell street lower, outside Graham Lemon's when a dark man had placed in his hand a throwaway (subsequently thrown away), advertising Elijah, restorer of the church in Zion: in Lincoln place outside the premises of F. W. Sweny and Co (Limited) dispensing chemists, when, when Frederick M. (Bantam) Lyons had rapidly and successively requested, perused and restituted the copy of the current issue of the Freeman's Journal and National Press which he had been about to throw away (subsequently thrown away), he had proceeded towards the oriental edifice of the Turkish and Warm Baths, 11 Leinster street, with the light of inspiration shining in his countenance and bearing in his arms the secret of the race, graven in the language of prediction.
What qualifying considerations allayed his perturbations?
The difficulties of interpretation since the significance of any event followed its occurrence as variably as the acoustic report followed the electrical discharge and of counterestimating against an actual loss by failure to interpret the total sum of possible losses proceeding originally from a successful interpretation.
His mood?
He had not risked, he did not expect, he had not been disappointed, he was satisfied.
What satisfied him?
To have sustained no positive loss. To have brought a positive gain to others. Light to the gentiles.
How did Bloom prepare a collation for a gentile?
He poured into two teacups two level spoonfuls, four in all, of Epps's soluble cocoa and proceeded according to the directions for use printed on the label, to each adding after sufficient time for infusion the prescribed ingredients for diffusion in the manner and in the quantity prescribed.
What supererogatory marks of special hospitality did the host show his guest?
Relinquishing his symposiarchal right to the moustache cup of imitation Crown Derby presented to him by his only daughter, Millicent (Milly), he substituted a cup identical with that of his guest and served extraordinarily to his guest and, in reduced measure, to himself the viscous cream ordinarily reserved for the breakfast of his wife Marion (Molly).
Was the guest conscious of and did he acknowledge these marks of hospitality?
His attention was directed to them by his host jocosely and he accepted them seriously as they drank in jocoserious silence Epps's massproduct, the creature cocoa.
Were there marks of hospitality which he contemplated but suppressed, reserving them for another and for himself on future occasions to complete the act begun?
The reparation of a fissure of the length of 1 1/2 inches in the right side of his guest's jacket. A gift to his guest of one of the four lady's handkerchiefs, if and when ascertained to be in a presentable condition.
Who drank more quickly?
Bloom, having the advantage of ten seconds at the initiation ad taking, from the concave surface of a spoon along the handle of which a steady flow of heat was conducted, three sips to his opponent's one, six to two, nine to three.
What cerebration accompanied his frequentative act?
Concluding by inspection but erroneously that his silent companion was engaged in mental composition he reflected on the pleasures derived from literature of instruction rather than of amusement as he himself had applied to the works of William Shakespeare more than once for the solution of difficult problems in imaginary or real life.
Had he found their solution?
In spite of careful and repeated reading of certain classical passages, aided by a glossary, he had derived imperfect conviction from the text, the answers not bearing on all points.
What lines concluded his first piece of original verse written by him, potential poet, at the age of 11 in 1877 on the occasion of the offering of three prizes at 10/-, 5/- and 2/6 respectively by the Shamrock, a weekly newspaper?
An ambition to squint
At my verses in print
Makes me hope that for these you'll find room.
If you so condescend
Then please place at the end
The name of yours truly, L. Bloom.
Did he find four separating forces between his temporary guest and him?
Name, age, race, creed.
What anagrams had he made on his name in youth?
Leopold Bloom
Ellpodbomool
Molldopeloob.
Bollo edoom
Old Ollebo, M. P.
What acrostic upon the abbreviation of his first name had he (kinetic poet) sent to Miss Marion Tweedy on the 14 February 1888?
Poets oft have sung in rhyme
Of music sweet their praise divine.
Let them hymn it nine times nine.
Dearer far than song or wine,
You are mine. The world is mine.
What had prevented him from completing a topical song (music by R. G. Johnston) on the events of the past, or fixtures for the actual years, entitled If Brian Boru could but come back and see old Dublin now, commissioned by Michael Gunn, lessee of the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, and to be introduced into the sixth scene, the valley of diamonds, of the second edition (30 January 1893) of the grand annual Christmas pantomime Sinbad the Sailor (written by Greenleaf Whittier, scenery by George A. Jackson and Cecil Hicks, costumes by Mrs and Miss Whelan, produced by R. Shelton 26 December 1892 under the personal supervision of Mrs Michael Gunn, ballets by Jessie Noir, harlequinade by Thomas Otto) and sung by Nelly Bouverist principal girl?
Firstly, oscillation between events of imperial and of local interest, the anticipated diamond jubilee of Queen Victoria (born 1820, acceded 1837) and the posticipated opening of the new municipal fish market: secondly, apprehension of opposition from extreme circles on the questions of the respective visits of Their Royal Highnesses, the duke and duchess of York (real), and of His Majesty King Brian Boru (imaginary); thirdly, a conflict between professional etiquette and professional emulation concerning the recent erections of the Grand Lyric Hall on Burgh Quay and the Theatre Royal in Hawkins street: fourthly, distraction resultant from compassion for Nelly Bouverist's non-intellectual, non-political, nontopical expression of countenance and concupiscence caused by Nelly Bouverist's revelations of white articles of nonintellectual, non-political, non-topical underclothing while she (Nelly Bouverist) was in the articles: fifthly, the difficulties of the selection of appropriate music and humorous allusions from Everybody's Book of Jokes (1,000 pages and a laugh in every one); sixthly, the rhymes homophonous and cacophonous, associated with the names of the new lord mayor, Daniel Tallon, the new high sheriff, Thomas Pile and the new solicitorgeneral, Dunbar Plunket Barton.
What relation existed between their ages?
16 years before in 1888 when Bloom was of Stephen's present age Stephen was 6.16 years after in 1920 when Stephen would be of Bloom's present age Bloom would be 54. In 1936 when Bloom would be 70 and Stephen 54 their ages initially in the ratio of 16 to 0 would be as 17 1/2 to 13 1/2, the proportion increasing and the disparity diminishing according as arbitrary future years were added, for if the proportion existing in 1883 had continued immutable, conceiving that to be possible, till then 1904 when Stephen was 22 Bloom would be 374 and in 1920 when Stephen would be 38, as Bloom then was, Bloom would be 646 while in 1952 when Stephen would have attained the maximum postdiluvian age of 70 Bloom, being 1190 years alive having been born in the year 714, would have surpassed by 221 years the maximum antediluvian age, that of Methusalah, 969 years, while, if Stephen would continue to live until he would attain that age in the year 3072 A.D., Bloom would have been obliged to have been alive 83,300 years, having been obliged to have been born in the year 81,396 B.C.
What events might nullify these calculations?
The cessation of existence of both or either, the inauguration of a new era or calendar, the annihilation of the world and consequent extermination of the human species, inevitable but impredictable.
How many previous encounters proved their preexisting acquaintance?
Two. The first in the lilacgarden of Matthew Dillon's house, Medina Villa, Kimmage road, Roundtown, in 1887, in the company of Stephen's mother, Stephen being then of the age of 5 and reluctant to give his hand in salutation. The second in the coffeeroom of Breslin's hotel on a rainy Sunday in the January of 1892, in the company of Stephen's father and Stephen's granduncle, Stephen being then 5 years older.
Did Bloom accept the invitation to dinner given then by the son and afterwards seconded by the father?
Very gratefully, with grateful appreciation, with sincere appreciative gratitude, in appreciatively grateful sincerity of regret, he declined.
Did their conversation on the subject of these reminiscences reveal a third connecting link between them?
Mrs Riordan, a widow of independent means, had resided in the house of Stephen's parents from 1 September 1888 to 29 December 1891 and had also resided during the years 1892, 1893 and 1894 in the City Arms Hotel owned by Elizabeth O'Dowd of 54 Prussia street where during parts of the years 1893 and 1894 she had been a constant informant of Bloom who resided also in the same hotel, being at that time a clerk in the employment of Joseph Cuffe of 5 Smithfield for the superintendence of sales in the adjacent Dublin Cattle market on the North Circular road.
Had he performed any special corporal work of mercy for her?
He had sometimes propelled her on warm summer evenings, an infirm widow of independent, if limited means, in her convalescent bathchair with slow revolutions of its wheels as far as the corner of the North Circular road opposite Mr Gavin Low's place of business where she had remained for a certain time scanning through his onelensed binocular fieldglasses unrecognisable citizens on tramcars, roadster bicycles, equipped with inflated pneumatic tyres, hackney carriages, tandems, private and hired landaus, dogcarts, ponytraps and brakes passing from the city to the Phoenix Park and vice versa.
Why could he then support that his vigil with the greater equanimity?
Because in middle youth he had often sat observing through a rondel of bossed glass of a multicoloured pane the spectacle offered with continual changes of the thoroughfare without, pedestrians, quadrupeds, velocipedes, vehicles, passing slowly, quickly, evenly, round and round and round the rim of a round precipitous globe.
What distinct different memories had each of her now eight years deceased?
The older, her bezique cards and counters, her Skye terrier, her suppositions wealth, her lapses of responsiveness and incipient catarrhal deafness: the younger, her lamp of colza oil before the statue of the Immaculate Conception, her green and maroon brushes for Charles Stewart Parnell and for Michael Davitt, her tissue papers.
Were there no means still remaining to him to achieve the rejuvenation which these reminiscences divulged to a younger companion rendered the more desirable?
The indoor exercises, formerly intermittently practised, subsequently abandoned, prescribed in Eugen Sandow's Physical Strength and How To Obtain It which, designed particularly for commercial men engaged in sedentary occupations, were to be made with mental concentration in front of a mirror so as to bring into play the various families of muscles and produce successively a pleasant relaxation and the most pleasant repristination of juvenile agility.
Had any special agility been his in earlier youth?
Though ringweight lifting had been beyond his strength and the full circle gyration beyond his courage yet as a High School scholar he had excelled in his table and protracted execution of the half lever movement on the parallel bars in consequence of his abnormally developed abdominal muscles.
Did either openly allude to their racial difference?
Neither.
What, reduced to their simplest reciprocal form, were Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom and Bloom's thoughts about Stephen's thoughts about Bloom's thoughts about Stephen?
He thought that he thought that he was a jew whereas he knew that he knew that he knew that he was not.
What, the enclosures of reticence removed, were their respective parentages?
Bloom, only born male transubstantial heir of Rudolf Virag (subsequently Rudolf Bloom) of Szombathely, Vienna, Budapest, Milan, London and Dublin and of Ellen Higgins, second daughter of Julius Higgins (born Karoly) and Fanny Higgins (born Hegarty); Stephen, eldest surviving male consubstantial heir of Simon Dedalus of Cork and Dublin and of Mary, daughter of Richard and Christina Goulding (born Grier).
Had Bloom and Stephen been baptised, and where and by whom, cleric or layman?
Bloom (three times) by the reverend Mr Gilmer Johnston M. A. alone in the protestant church of Saint Nicolas Without, Coombe; by James O'Connor, Philip Gilligan and James Fitzpatrick, together, under a pump in the village of Swords; and by the reverend Charles Malone C. C., in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar. Stephen (once) by the reverend Charles Malone, C. C., alone, in the church of the Three Patrons, Rathgar.
Did they find their educational careers similar?
Substituting Stephen for Bloom Stoom would have passed successively through a dame's school and the high school. Substituting Bloom for Stephen Blephen would have passed successively through the preparatory, junior, middle and senior grades of the intermediate and through the matriculation, first arts, second arts and arts degree course of the royal university.
Why did Bloom refrain from stating that he had frequented the university of life?
Because of his fluctuating incertitude as to whether this observation had or had not been already made by him to Stephen or by Stephen to him.
What two temperaments did they individually represent?
The scientific. The artistic.
What proofs did Bloom adduce to prove that his tendency was towards applied, rather than towards pure, science?
Certain possible inventions of which he had cogitated when reclining in a state of supine repletion to aid digestion, stimulated by his appreciation of the importance of inventions now common but once revolutionary for example, the aeronautic parachute, the reflecting telescope, the spiral corkscrew, the safety pin, the mineral water siphon, the canal lock with winch and sluice, the suction pump.
Were these inventions principally intended for an improved scheme of kindergarten?
Yes, rendering obsolete popguns, elastic airbladders, games of hazard, catapults. They comprised astronomical kaleidoscopes exhibiting the twelve constellations of the zodiac from Aries to Pisces, miniature mechanical orreries, arithmetical gelatine lozenges, geometrical to correspond with zoological biscuits, globemap playingballs, historically costumed dolls.
What also stimulated him in his cogitations?
The financial success achieved by Ephraim Marks and Charles A. James, the former by his 1d. bazaar at 42 George's street, South, the latter at his 6 1/2d. shop and world's fancy fair and waxwork exhibition at 30 Henry street, admission 2d., children 1d.; and the infinite possibilities hitherto unexploited of the modern art of advertisement if condensed in triliteral monoideal symbols, vertically of maximum visibility (divined), horizontally of maximum legibility (deciphered) and of magnetising efficacy to arrest involuntary attention, to interest, to convince, to decide.

What is home without Plumtree's Potted Meat?
Incomplete.
With it an abode of bliss.
Manufactured by George Plumtree, 23 Merchants' quay, Dublin, put up in 4 oz. pots, and inserted by Councillor Joseph P. Nannetti, M. P., Rotunda Ward, 19 Hardwicke street, under the obituary notices and anniversaries of deceases. The name on the label is Plumtree. A plumtree is a meatpot, registered trade mark. Beware of imitations. Peatmot. Trumplee. Montpat. Plamtroo.
Which example did he adduce to induce Stephen to deduce that originality, though producing its own reward, does not invariably conduce to success?
His own ideated and rejected project of an illuminated showcart, drawn by a beast of burden, in which two smartly dressed girls were to be seated engaged in writing.
What suggested scene was then constructed by Stephen?
Solitary hotel in mountain pass. Autumn. Twilight. Fire lit. In dark corner young man seated. Young woman enters. Restless. Solitary. She sits. She goes to window. She stands. She sits. Twilight. She thinks. On solitary hotel paper she writes. She thinks. She writes. She sighs. Wheels and hoofs. She hurries out. He comes from his dark corner. He seizes solitary paper. He holds it towards fire. Twilight. He reads. Solitary
What?
In sloping, upright and backhands: Queen's hotel, Queen's hotel, Queen's Ho...
What suggested scene was then reconstructed by Bloom?
The Queen's Hotel, Ennis, County, Glare, where Rudolph Bloom (Rudolf Virag) died on the evening of the 27 June 1886, at some hour unstated, in consequence of an overdose of monkshood (aconite) selfadministered in the form of a neuralgic liniment, composed of 2 parts of aconite liniment to 1 of chloroform liniment (purchased by him at 10.20 a.m. on the morning of 27 June 1886 at the medical hall of Francis Dennehy, 17 Church street, Ennis) after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at 3.15 p.m. on the afternoon of 27 June 1886 a new boater straw hat, extra smart (after having, though not in consequence of having, purchased at the hour and in the place aforesaid, the toxin aforesaid), at the general drapery store of James Cullen, 4 Main street, Ennis.
Did he attribute this homonymity to information or coincidence or intuition?
Coincidence.
Did he depict the scene verbally for his guest to see?
He preferred himself to see another's face and listen to another's words by which potential narration was realised and kinetic temperament relieved.
Did he see only a second coincidence in the second scene narrated to him, described by the narrator as A Pisgah Sight of Palestine or The Parable of the Plums?
It, with the preceding scene and with others unnarrated but existent by implication, to which add essays on various subjects or moral apothegms (e.g. My Favourite Hero or Procrastination is the Thief of Time) composed during schoolyears, seemed to him to contain in itself and in conjunction with the personal equation certain possibilities of financial, social, personal and sexual success, whether specially collected and selected as model pedagogic themes (of cent per cent merit) for the use of preparatory and junior grade students or contributed in printed form, following the precedent of Philip Beaufoy or Doctor Dick or Heblon's Studies in Blue, to a publication of certified circulation and solvency or employed verbally as intellectual stimulation for sympathetic auditors, tacitly appreciative of successful narrative and confidently augurative of successful achievement, during the increasingly longer nights gradually following the summer solstice on the day but three following, videlict, Tuesday, 21 June (S. Aloysius Gonzaga), sunrise 3.33 a.m., sunset 8.29 p.m.
Which domestic problem as much as, if not more than, any other frequently engaged his mind?
What to do with our wives.
What had been his hypothetical singular solutions?
Parlour games (dominos, halma, tiddledywinks, spillikins, cup and ball, nap, spoil five, bezique, twentyfive, beggar my neighbour, draughts, chess or backgammon): embroidery, darning or knitting for the policeaided clothing society: musical duets, mandoline and guitar, piano and flute, guitar and piano: legal scrivenery or envelope addressing: biweekly visits to variety entertainments: commercial activity as pleasantly commanding and pleasingly obeyed mistress proprietress in a cool dairy shop or warm cigar divan: the clandestine satisfaction of erotic irritation in masculine brothels, state inspected and medically controlled: social visits, at regular infrequent prevented intervals and with regular frequent preventive superintendence, to and from female acquaintances of recognised respectability in the vicinity: courses of evening instruction specially designed to render liberal instruction agreeable.
What instances of deficient mental development in his wife inclined him in favour of the lastmentioned (ninth) solution?
In disoccupied moments she had more than once covered a sheet of paper with signs and hieroglyphics which she stated were Greek and Irish and Hebrew characters. She had interrogated constantly at varying intervals as to the correct method of writing the capital initial of the name of a city in Canada, Quebec. She understood little of political complications, internal, or balance of power, external. In calculating the addenda of bills she frequently had recourse to digital aid. After completion of laconic epistolary compositions she abandoned the implement of calligraphy in the encaustic pigment exposed to the corrosive action of copperas, green vitriol and nutgall. Unusual polysyllables of foreign origin she interpreted phonetically or by false analogy or by both: metempsychosis (met him pike hoses), alias (a mendacious person mentioned in sacred Scripture).
What compensated in the false balance of her intelligence for these and such deficiencies of judgment regarding persons, places and things?
The false apparent parallelism of all perpendicular arms of all balances, proved true by construction. The counterbalance of her proficiency of judgment regarding one person, proved true by experiment.
How had he attempted to remedy this state of comparative ignorance?
Variously. By leaving in a conspicuous place a certain book open at a certain page: by assuming in her, when alluding explanatorily, latent knowledge: by open ridicule in her presence of some absent other's ignorant lapse.
With what success had he attempted direct instruction?
She followed not all, a part of the whole, gave attention with interest, comprehended with surprise, with care repeated, with greater difficulty remembered, forgot with ease, with misgiving reremembered, rerepeated with error.
What system had proved more effective?
Indirect suggestion implicating self-interest.
Example?
She disliked umbrella with rain, he liked woman with umbrella, she disliked new hat with rain, he liked woman with new hat, he bought new hat with rain, she carried umbrella with new hat.
Accepting the analogy implied in his guest's parable which examples of postexilic eminence did he adduce?
Three seekers of the pure truth, Moses of Egypt, Moses Maimonides, author of More Neubkim (Guide of the Perplexed) and Moses Mendelssohn of such eminence that from Moses (of Egypt) to Moses (Mendelssohn) there arose none like Moses (Maimonides).
What statement was made, under correction, by Bloom concerning a fourth seeker of pure truth, by name Aristotle, mentioned, with permission, by Stephen?
That the seeker mentioned had been a pupil of a rabbinical philosopher, name uncertain.
Were other anapocryphal illustrious sons of the law and children of a selected or rejected race mentioned?
Felix Bartholdy Mendelssohn (composer), Baruch Spinoza (philosopher), Mendoza (pugilist), Ferdinand Lassalle (reformer, duellist).
What fragments of verse from the ancient Hebrew and ancient Irish languages were cited with modulations of voice and translation of texts by guest to host and by host to guest?
By Stephen: suil, suil, suil arun, suil go siocair agus, suil go cuin (walk, walk, walk your way, walk in safety, walk with care).
By Bloom: Kifeloch, harimon rakatejch m'baad l'zamatejch (thy temple amid thy hair is as a slice of pomegranate).
How was a glyphic comparison of the phonic symbols of both languages made in substantiation of the oral comparison?
On the penultimate blank page of a book of inferior literary style, entitled Sweets of Sin (produced by Bloom and so manipulated that its front cover came in contact with the surface of the table) with a pencil (supplied by Stephen) Stephen wrote the Irish characters for gee, eh, dee, em, simple and modified, and Bloom in turn wrote the Hebrew characters ghimel, aleph, daleth and (in the absence of mem) a substituted goph, explaining their arithmetical values as ordinal and cardinal numbers, videlicet 3, 1,4 and 100.
Was the knowledge possessed by both of each of these languages, the extinct and the revived, theoretical or practical?
Theoretical, being confined to certain grammatical rules of accidence and syntax and practically excluding vocabulary.
What points of contact existed between these languages and between the peoples who spoke them?
The presence of guttural sounds, diacritic aspirations, epenthetic and servile letters in both languages: their antiquity, both having been taught on the plain of Shinar 242 years after the deluge in the seminary instituted by Fenius Farsaigh, descendant of Noah, progenitor of Israel, and ascendant of Heber and Heremon, progenitors of Ireland: their archeological, genealogical, hagiographical, exegetical, homilectic, toponomastic, historical and religious literatures comprising the works of rabbis and culdees, Torah, Talmud (Mischna and Ghemara) Massor, Pentateuch, Book of the Dun Cow, Book of Ballymote, Garland of Howth, Book of Kells: their dispersal, persecution, survival and revival: the isolation of their synagogical and ecclesiastical rites in ghetto (S. Mary's Abbey) and masshouse (Adam and Eve's tavern): the proscription of their national costumes in penal laws and Jewish dress acts: the restoration in Chanan David of Zion and the possibility of Irish political autonomy or devolution.
What anthem did Bloom chant partially in anticipation of that multiple, ethnically irreductible consummation?
Kolod balejwaw pnimali
Nefesch, jehudi, homijah.
Why was the chant arrested at the conclusion of this first distich?
In consequence of defective mnemotechnic.
How did the chanter compensate for this deficiency? By a periphrastic version of the general text.
In what common study did their mutual reflections merge?
The increasing simplification traceable from the Egyptian epigraphic hieroglyphs to the Greek and Roman alphabets and the anticipation of modern stenography and telegraphic code in the cuneiform inscriptions (Semitic) and the virgular quinquecostate ogham writing (Celtic).
Did the guest comply with his host's request?
Doubly, by appending his signature in Irish and Roman characters.
What was Stephen's auditive sensation?
He heard in a profound ancient male unfamiliar melody the accumulation of the past.
What was Bloom's visual sensation?
He saw in a quick young male familiar form the predestination of a future.
What were Stephen's and Bloom's quasisimultaneous volitional quasisensations of concealed identities?
Visually, Stephen's: The traditional figure of hypostasis, depicted by Johannes Damascenus, Lentulus Romanus and Epiphanius Monachus as leucodermic, sesquipedalian with winedark hair.
Auditively, Bloom's: The traditional accent of the ecstasy of catastrophe.
What future careers had been possible for Bloom in the past and with what exemplars?
In the church, Roman, Anglican, or Nonconformist: exemplars, the very reverend John Conmee S.J., the reverend T. Salmon, D.D., provost of Trinity college, Dr Alexander J. Dowie. At the bar, English or Irish: exemplars, Seymour Bushe, K.C., Rufus Isaacs, K.C. On the stage, modern or Shakespearean exemplars, Charles Wyndham, high comedian, Osmond Tearle (1901), exponent of Shakespeare.
Did the host encourage his guest to chant in a modulated voice a strange legend on an allied theme?
Reassuringly, their place where none could hear them talk being secluded, reassured, the decocted beverages, allowing for subsolid residual sediment of a mechanical mixture, water plus sugar plus cream plus cocoa, having been consumed.
Recite the first (major) part of this chanted legend?
D Little Harry Hughes and his schoolfellows all Went out for to play ball
And the very first ball little Harry Hughes played
He drove it o'er the jew's garden wall.
And the very second ball little Harry Hughes played
He broke the jew's windows all.
How did the son of Rudolph receive this first part?
With unmixed feeling. Smiling, a jew, he heard with pleasure and saw the unbroken kitchen window.
Recite the second part (minor) of the legend.
Then out there came the jew's daughter
And she all dressed in green.
`Come back, come back, you pretty little boy,
And play your ball again.'
`I can't come back and I won't come back
Without my schoolfellows all,
For if my master he did hear
He'd make it a sorry ball.'
She took him by the lilywhite hand
And led him along the hall
Until she led him to a room
Where none could hear him call.
She took a penknife out of her pocket
And cut off his little head,
And now he'll play his ball no more
For he lies among the dead.
How did the father of Millicent receive this second part?
With mixed feelings. Unsmiling, he heard and saw with wonder a jew's daughter, all dressed in green.
Condense Stephen's commentary.
One of all, the least of all, is the victim predestined. Once by inadvertence, twice by design he challenges his destiny. It comes when he is abandoned and challenges him reluctant and, as an apparition of hope and youth holds him unresisting. It leads him to a strange habitation, to a secret infidel apartment, and there, implacable, immolates him, consenting.
Why was the host (victim predestined) sad?
He wished that a tale of a deed should be told of a deed not by him should by him not be told.
Why was the host (reluctant, unresisting) still?
In accordance with the law of the conservation of energy.
Why was the host (secret infidel) silent?
He weighed the possible evidences for and against ritual murder: the incitation of the hierarchy, the superstition of the populace, the propagation of rumour in continued fraction of veridicity, the envy of opulence, the influence of retaliation, the sporadic reappearance of atavistic delinquency, the mitigating circumstances of fanaticism, hypnotic suggestion and somnambulism.
From which (if any) of these mental or physical disorders was he not totally immune?
From hypnotic suggestion: once, waking, he had not recognised his sleeping apartment: more than once, waking, he had been for an indefinite time incapable of moving or uttering sounds. From somnambulism: once, sleeping, his body had risen, crouched and crawled in the direction of a heatless fire and, having attained its destination, there, curled, unheated in night attire had lain, sleeping.
Had this latter or any cognate phenomenon declared itself in any member of his family?
Twice, in Holles street and in Ontario terrace, his daughter Millicent (Milly) at the ages of 6 and 8 years had uttered in sleep an exclamation of terror and had replied to the interrogations of two figures in night attire with a vacant mute expression.
What other infantile memories had he of her?
15 June 1889. A querulous newborn female infant crying to cause and lessen congestion. A child renamed Padney Socks she shook with shocks her moneybox: counted his three free moneypenny buttons one, tloo, tlee: a doll, a boy, a sailor she cast away: blond, born of two dark, she had blond ancestry, remote, a violation, Herr Hauptmann Hainau, Austrian army, proximate, a hallucination, lieutenant Mulvey, British navy.
What endemic characteristics were present?
Conversely the nasal and frontal formation was derived in a direct line of lineage which, though interrupted, would continue at distant intervals to its most distant intervals.
What memories had he of her adolescence?
She relegated her hoop and skippingrope to a recess. On the duke's lawn entreated by an English visitor, she declined to permit him to make and take away her photographic image (objection not stated). On the South Circular road in the company of Elsa Potter, followed by an individual of sinister aspect, she went half way down Stamer street and turned abruptly back (reason of change not stated). On the vigil of the 15th anniversary of her birth she wrote a letter from Mullingar, county Westmeath, making a brief allusion to a local student (faculty and year not stated).
Did that first division, portending a second division, afflict him?
Less than he had imagined, more than he had hoped.
What second departure was contemporaneously perceived by him similarly if differently?
A temporary departure of his cat.
Why similarly, why differently?
Similarly, because actuated by a secret purpose the quest of a new male (Mullingar student) or of a healing herb (valerian). Differently, because of different possible returns to the inhabitants or to the habitation.
In other respects were their differences similar?
In passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness.
As?
Inasmuch as leaning she sustained her blond hair for him to ribbon it for her (cf. neckarching cat). Moreover, on the free surface of the lake in Stephen's green amid inverted reflections of trees her uncommented spit, describing concentric circles of waterrings, indicated by the constancy of its permanence the locus of a somnolent prostrate fish (cf. mousewatching cat). Again, in order to remember the date, combatants, issue and consequences of a famous military engagement she pulled a plait of her hair (cf. earwashing cat). Furthermore, silly Milly, she dreamed of having had an unspoken unremembered conversation with a horse whose name had been Joseph to whom (which) she had offered a tumblerful of lemonade which it (he) had appeared to have accepted (cf. hearthdreaming cat). Hence in passivity, in economy, in the instinct of tradition, in unexpectedness, their differences were similar.
In what way had he utilised gifts 1) an owl, 2) a clock, given as matrimonial auguries, to interest and to instruct her?
As object lessons to explain: 1) the nature and habits of oviparous animals, the possibility of aerial flight, certain abnormalities of vision, the secular process of imbalsamation: 2) the principle of the pendulum, exemplified in bob, wheelgear and regulator, the translation in terms of human or social regulation of the various positions clockwise of movable indicators on an unmoving dial, the exactitude of the recurrence per hour of an instant in each hour, when the longer and the shorter indicator were at the same angle of inclination, videlicet, 5 5/11 minutes past each hour per hour in arithmetical progression.
In what manners did she reciprocate?
She remembered: on the 27th anniversary of his birth she presented to him a breakfast moustachecup of imitation crown Derby porcelain ware. She provided: at quarter day or thereabouts if or when purchases had been made by him not for her she showed herself attentive to his necessities, anticipating his desires. She admired: a natural phenomenon having been explained by him not for her she expressed the immediate desire to possess without gradual acquisition a fraction of his science, the moiety, the quarter, a thousandth part.
What proposal did Bloom, diambulist, father of Milly, somnambulist, make to Stephen, noctambulist?
To pass in repose the hours intervening between Thursday (proper) and Friday (normal) on an extemporised cubicle in the apartment immediately above the kitchen and immediately adjacent to the sleeping apartment of his host and hostess.
What various advantages would or might have resulted from a prolongation of such extemporisation?
For the guest: security of domicile and seclusion of study. For the host: rejuvenation of intelligence, vicarious satisfaction. For the hostess: disintegration of obsession, acquisition of correct Italian pronunciation.
Why might these several provisional contingencies between a guest and a hostess not necessarily preclude or be precluded by a permanent eventuality of reconciliatory union between a schoolfellow and a jew's daughter?
Because the way to daughter led through mother, the way to mother through daughter.
To what inconsequent polysyllabic question of his host did the guest return a monosyllabic negative answer?
If he had known the late Mrs Emily Sinico, accidentally killed at Sydney Parade railway station, 14 October 1903.
What inchoate corollary statement was consequently suppressed by the host?
A statement explanatory of his absence on the occasion of the interment of Mrs Mary Dedalus, born Goulding, 26 June 1903, vigil of the anniversary of the decease of Rudolph Bloom (born Virag).
Was the proposal of asylum accepted?
Promptly, inexplicably, with amicability, gratefully it was declined.
What exchange of money took place between host and guest?
The former returned to the latter, without interest, a sum of money (œ1.7s.0.), one pound seven shillings, advanced by the latter to the former.
What counterproposals were alternately advanced, accepted, modified, declined, restated in other terms, reaccepted, ratified, reconfirmed?
To inaugurate a prearranged course of Italian instruction, place the residence of the instructed. To inaugurate a course of vocal instruction, place the residence of the instructress. To inaugurate a series of static, semistatic and peripatetic intellectual dialogues, places the residence of both speakers (if both speakers were resident in the same place), the Ship hotel and tavern, 6 Lower Abbey street (W. and E. Connery, proprietors), the National Library of Ireland, 10 Kildare street, the National Maternity Hospital, 29, 30 and 31 Holles street, a public garden, the vicinity of a place of worship, a conjunction of two or more public thoroughfares, the point of bisection of a right line drawn between their residences (if both speakers were resident in different places).
What rendered problematic for Bloom the realisation of these mutually selfexcluding propositions?
The irreparability of the past: once at a performance of Albert Hengler's circus in the Rotunda, Rutland square, Dublin, an intuitive particoloured clown in quest of paternity had penetrated from the ring to a place in the auditorium where Bloom, solitary, was seated and had publicly declared to an exhilarated audience that he (Bloom) was his (the clown's) papa. The imprevidibility of the future: once in the summer of 1898 he (Bloom) had marked a florin (2s.) with three notches on the milled edge and tendered it in payment of an account due to and received by J. and T. Davy, family grocers, 1 Charlemont Mall, Grand Canal, for circulation on the waters of civic finance, for possible, circuitous or direct, return.
Was the clown Bloom's son?
No.
Had Bloom's coin returned?
Never.
Why would a recurrent frustration the more depress him?
Because at the critical turningpoint of human existence he desired to amend many social conditions, the product of inequality and avarice and international animosity.
He believed then that human life was infinitely perfectible, eliminating these conditions?
There remained the generic conditions imposed by natural, as distinct from human law, as integral parts of the human whole: the necessity of destruction to procure alimentary sustenance: the painful character of the ultimate functions of separate existence, the agonies of birth and death: the monotonous menstruation of simian and (particularly) human females extending from the age of puberty to the menopause: inevitable accidents at sea, in mines and factories: certain very painful maladies and their resultant surgical operations, innate lunacy and congenital criminality, decimating epidemics: catastrophic cataclysms which make terror the basis of human mentality: seismic upheavals the epicentres of which are located in densely populated regions: the fact of vital growth, through convulsions of metamorphosis from infancy through maturity to decay.
Why did he desist from speculation?
Because it was a task for a superior intelligence to substitute other more acceptable phenomena in place of the less acceptable phenomena to be removed.
Did Stephen participate in his dejection?
He affirmed his significance as a conscious rational animal proceeding syllogistically from the known to the unknown and a conscious rational reagent between a micro- and a macrocosm ineluctably constructed upon the incertitude of the void.
Was this affirmation apprehended by Bloom?
Not verbally. Substantially.
What comforted his misapprehension?
That as a competent keyless citizen he had proceeded energetically from the unknown to the known through the incertitude of the void.
I n what order of precedence, with what attendant ceremony was the exodus from the house of bondage to the wilderness of inhabitation effected?
Lighted Candle in Stick borne by
BLOOM.
Diaconal Hat on Ashplant borne by
STEPHEN.
With what intonation secreto of what commemorative psalm?
The 113th, modus peregrinus: In exitu Israël de Egypto: domus Jacob de populo barbaro.
What did each do at the door of egress?
Bloom set the candlestick on the floor. Stephen put the hat on his head.
For what creature was the door of egress a door of ingress?
For a cat.
What spectacle confronted them when they, first the host, then the guest, emerged silently, doubly dark, from obscurity by a passage from the rere of the house into the penumbra of the garden?
The heaventree of stars hung with humid nightblue fruit.
With what meditations did Bloom accompany his demonstration to his companion of various constellations?
Meditations of evolution increasingly vaster: of the moon invisible in incipent lunation, approaching perigee: of the infinite lattiginous scintillating uncondensed milky way, discernible by daylight by an observer placed at the lower end of a cylindrical vertical shaft 5000 ft deep sunk from the surface towards the centre of the earth: of Sirius (alpha in Canis Major) 10 lightyears (57,000,000,000,000 miles) distant and in volume 900 times the dimension of our planet: of Arcturus: of the precession of equinoxes: of Orion with belt and sextuple sun theta and nebula in which 100 of our solar systems could be contained: of moribund and of nascent new stars such as Nova in 1901: of our system plunging towards the constellation of Hercules: of the parallax or parallactic drift of socalled fixed stars, in reality evermoving from immeasurably remote eons to infinitely remote futures in comparison with which the years, threescore and ten, of allotted human life formed a parenthesis of infinitesimal brevity.
Were there obverse meditations of involution increasingly less vast?
Of the eons of geological periods recorded in the stratifications of the earth: of the myriad minute entomological organic existences concealed in cavities of the earth, beneath removable stones, in hives and mounds, of microbes, germs, bacteria, bacilli, spermatozoa: of the incalculable trillions of billions of millions of imperceptible molecules contained by cohesion of molecular affinity in a single pinhead: of the universe of human serum constellated with red and white bodies, themselves universes of void space constellated with other bodies, each, in continuity, its universe of divisible component bodies of which each was again divisible in divisions of redivisible component bodies, dividends and divisors ever diminishing without actual division till, if the progress were carried far enough, nought nowhere was never reached.
Why did he not elaborate these calculations to a more precise result?
Because some years previously in 1886 when occupied with the problem of the quadrature of the circle he had learned of the existence of a number computed to a relative degree of accuracy to be of such magnitude and of so many places, e.g., the 9th power of the 9th power of 9, that, the result having been obtained, 33 closely printed volumes of 1000 pages each of innumerable quires and reams of India paper would have to be requisitioned in order to contain the complete tale of its printed integers of units, tens, hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions, billions, the nucleus of the nebula of every digit of every series containing succinctly the potentiality of being raised to the utmost kinetic elaboration of any power of any of its powers.
Did he find the problem of the inhabitability of the planets and their satellites by a race, given in species, and of the possible social and moral redemption of said race by a redeemer, easier of solution?
Of a different order of difficulty. Conscious that the human organism, normally capable of sustaining an atmospheric pressure of 19 tons, when elevated to a considerable altitude in the terrestrial atmosphere suffered with arithmetical progression of intensity, according as the line of demarcation between troposphere and stratosphere was approximated, from nasal hemorrhage, impeded respiration and vertigo, when proposing this problem for solution he had conjectured as a working hypothesis which could not be proved impossible that a more adaptable and differently anatomically constructed race of beings might subsist otherwise under Martian, Mercurial, Veneral, Jovian, Saturnian, Neptunian or Uranian sufficient and equivalent conditions, though an apogean humanity of beings created in varying forms with finite differences resulting similar to the whole and to one another would probably there as here remain inalterably and inalienably attached to vanities, to vanities of vanities and all that is vanity.
And the problem of possible redemption?
The minor was proved by the major.
Which various features of the constellations were in turn considered?
The various colours significant of various degrees of vitality (white, yellow, crimson, vermilion, cinnabar): their degrees of brilliancy: their magnitudes revealed up to and including the 7th: their positions: the waggoner's star: Walsingham way: the chariot of David: the annular cinctures of Saturn: the condensation of spiral nebulae into suns: the interdependent gyrations of double suns: the independent synchronous discoveries of Galileo, Simon Marius, Piazzi, Le Verrier, Herschel, Galle: the systematisations attempted by Bode and Kepler of cubes of distances and squares of times of revolution: the almost infinite compressibility of hirsute comets and their vast elliptical egressive and reentrant orbits from perihelion to aphelion: the sidereal origin of meteoric stones: the Libyan floods on Mars about the period of the birth of the younger astroscopist: the annual recurrence of meteoric showers about the period of the feast of S. Lawrence (martyr, 10 August): the monthly recurrence known as the new moon with the old moon in her arms: the posited influence of celestial on human bodies: the appearance of a star (1st magnitude) of exceeding brilliancy dominating by night and day (a new luminous sun generated by the collision and amalgamation in incandescence of two nonluminous exsuns) about the period of the birth of William Shakespeare over delta in the recumbent neversetting constellation of Cassiopeia and of a star (2nd magnitude) of similar origin but lesser brilliancy which had appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of the Corona Septentrionalis about the period of the birth of Leopold Bloom and of other stars of (presumably) similar origin which had (effectively or presumably) appeared in and disappeared from the constellation of Andromeda about the period of the birth of Stephen Dedalus, and in and from the constellation of Auriga some years after the birth and death of Rudolph Bloom, junior, and in and from other constellations some years before or after the birth or death of other persons: the attendant phenomena of eclipses, solar and lunar, from immersion to emersion, abatement of wind, transit of shadow, taciturnity of winged creatures, emergence of nocturnal or crepuscular animals, persistence of infernal light, obscurity of terrestrial waters, pallor of human beings.
His (Bloom's) logical conclusion, having weighed the matter and allowing for possible error?
That it was not a heaventree, not a heavengrot, not a heavenbeast, not a heavenman. That it was a Utopia, there being no known method from the known to the unknown: an infinity, renderable equally finite by the suppositions probable apposition of one or more bodies equally of the same and of different magnitudes: a mobility of illusory forms immobilised in space, remobilised in air: a past which possibly had ceased to exist as a present before its future spectators had entered actual present existence.
Was he more convinced of the esthetic value of the spectacle?
Indubitably in consequence of the reiterated examples of poets in the delirium of the frenzy of attachment or in the abasement of rejection invoking ardent sympathetic constellations or the frigidity of the satellite of their planet.
Did he then accept as an article of belief the theory of astrological influences upon sublunary disasters?
It seemed to him as possible of proof as of confutation and the nomenclature employed in its selenographical charts as attributable to verifiable intuition as to fallacious analogy: the lake of dreams, the sea of rains, the gulf of dews, the ocean of fecundity.
What special affinities appeared to him to exist between the moon and woman?
Her antiquity in preceding and surviving successive tellurian generations: her nocturnal predominance: her satellitic dependence: her luminary reflection: her constancy under all her phases, rising, and setting by her appointed times, waxing and waning: the forced invariability of her aspect: her indeterminate response to inaffirmative interrogation: her potency over effluent and refluent waters: her power to enamour, to mortify, to invest with beauty, to render insane, to incite to and aid delinquency: the tranquil inscrutability of her visage: the terribility of her isolated dominant implacable resplendent propinquity: her omens of tempest and of calm: the stimulation of her light, her motion and her presence: the admonition of her craters, her arid seas, her silence: her splendour, when visible: her attraction, when invisible.
What visible luminous sign attracted Bloom's, who attracted Stephen's gaze?
In the second storey (rere) of his (Bloom's) house the light of a paraffin oil lamp with oblique shade projected on a screen of roller blind supplied by Frank O'Hara, window blind, curtain pole and revolving shutter manufacturer, 16 Aungier street.
How did he elucidate the mystery of an invisible person, his wife Marion (Molly) Bloom, denoted by a visible splendid sign, a lamp?
With indirect and direct verbal allusions or affirmations: with subdued affection and admiration: with description: with impediment: with suggestion.
Both then were silent?
Silent, each contemplating the other in both mirrors of the reciprocal flesh of theirhisnothis fellowfaces.
Were they indefinitely inactive?
At Stephen's suggestion, at Bloom's instigation both, first Stephen, then Bloom, in penumbra urinated, their sides contiguous, their organs of micturition reciprocally rendered invisible by manual circumposition, their gazes, first Bloom's, then Stephen's, elevated to the projected luminous and semiluminous shadow.
Similarly?
The trajectories of their, first sequent, then simultaneous, urinations were dissimilar: Bloom's longer, less irruent, in the incomplete form of the bifurcated penultimate alphabetical letter who in his ultimate year at High School (1880) had been capable of attaining the point of greatest altitude against the whole concurrent strength of the institution, 210 scholars: Stephen's higher, more sibilant, who in the ultimate hours of the previous day had augmented by diuretic consumption an insistent vesical pressure.
What different problems presented themselves to each concerning the invisible audible collateral organ of the other?
To Bloom: the problems of irritability, tumescence, rigidity, reactivity, dimension, sanitariness, pelosity. To Stephen: the problem of the sacerdotal integrity of Jesus circumcised (1st January, holiday of obligation to hear mass and abstain from unnecessary servile work) and the problem as to whether the divine prepuce, the carnal bridal ring of the holy Roman catholic apostolic church, conserved in Calcata, were deserving of simple hyperduly or of the fourth degree of latria accorded to the abscission of such divine excrescences as hair and toenails.
What celestial sign was by both simultaneously observed?
A star precipitated with great apparent velocity across the firmament from Vega in the Lyre above the zenith beyond the stargroup of the Tress of Berenice towards the zodiacal sign of Leo.
How did the centripetal remainer afford egress to the centrifugal departer?
By inserting the barrel of an arruginated male key in the hole of an unstable female lock, obtaining a purchase on the bow of the key and turning its wards from right to left, withdrawing a bolt from its staple, pulling inward spasmodically an obsolescent unhinged door and revealing an aperture for free egress and free ingress.
How did they take leave, one of the other, in separation?
Standing perpendicular at the same door and on different sides of its base, the lines of their valedictory arms, meeting at any point and forming any angle less than the sum of two right angles.
What sound accompanied the union of their tangent, the disunion of their (respectively) centrifugal and centripetal hands?
The sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells in the church of Saint George.
What echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?
By Stephen:
Liliata rutilantium. Turma circumdet.
Iubilantium te virginum. Chorus excipiat.
By Bloom:
Heigho, heigho,
Heigho, heigho.
Where were the several members of the company which with Bloom that day at the bidding of that peal had travelled from Sandymount in the south to Glasnevin in the north?
Martin Cunningham (in bed), Jack Power (in bed), Simon Dedalus (in bed), Tom Kernan (in bed), Ned Lambert (in bed), Joe Hynes (in bed), John Henry Menton (in bed), Bernard Corrigan (in bed), Patsy Dignam (in bed), Paddy Dignam (in the grave).
Alone, what did Bloom hear?
The double reverberation of retreating feet on the heavenborn earth, the double vibration of a jew's harp in the resonant lane.
Alone, what did Bloom feel?
The cold of interstellar space, thousands of degrees below freezing point or the absolute zero of Fahrenheit, Centigrade or Réaumur: the incipient intimations of proximate dawn.
Of what did bellchime and handtouch and footstep and lonechill remind him?
Of companions now in various manners in different places defunct: Percy Apjohn (killed in action, Modder River), Philip Gilligan (phthisis, Jervis Street hospital), Matthew F. Kane (accidental drowning, Dublin Bay), Philip Moisel (pyemia, Heytesbury street), Michael Hart (phthisis, Mater Misericordi? hospital), Patrick Dignam (apoplexy, Sandymount).
What prospect of what phenomena inclined him to remain?
The disparition of three final stars, the diffusion of day-break, the apparition of a new solar disk.
Had he ever been a spectator of those phenomena?
Once, in 1887 after a protracted performance of charades in the house of Luke Doyle, Kimmage, he had awaited with patience the apparition of the diurnal phenomenon, seated on a wall, his gaze turned in the direction of Mizrach, the east.
He remembered the initial paraphenomena?
More active air, a matutinal distant cock, ecclesiastical clocks at various points, avine music, the isolated tread of an early wayfarer, the visible diffusion of the light of an invisible luminous body, the first golden limb of the resurgent sun perceptible low on the horizon.
Did he remain?
With deep inspiration he returned, retraversing the garden, reentering the passage, reclosing the door. With brief suspiration he reassumed the candle, reascended the stairs, reapproached the door of the front room, hallfloor, and reentered.
What suddenly arrested his ingress?
The right temporal lobe of the hollow sphere of his cranium came into contact with a solid timber angle where, an infinitesimal but sensible fraction of a second later, a painful sensation was located in consequence of antecedent sensations transmitted and registered.
Describe the alterations effected in the disposition of the articles of furnitures?
A sofa upholstered in prune plush had been translocated from opposite the door to the ingleside near the compactly furled Union Jack (an alteration which he had frequently intended to execute): the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table had been placed opposite the door in the place vacated by the prune plush sofa: the walnut sideboard (a projecting angle of which had momentarily arrested his ingress) had been moved from its position beside the door to a more advantageous but more perilous position in front of the door: two chairs had been moved from right and left of the ingleside to the position originally occupied by the blue and white checker inlaid majolicatopped table.
Describe them.
One: a squat stuffed easychair with stout arms extended and back slanted to the rere, which, repelled in recoil, had then upturned an irregular fringe of a rectangular rug and now displayed on its amply upholstered seat a centralised diffusing and diminishing discolouration. The other: a slender splayfoot chair of glossy cane curves, placed directly opposite the former, its frame from top to seat and from seat to base being varnished dark brown, its seat being a bright circle of white plaited rush.
What significances attached to these two chairs?
Significances of similitude, of posture, of symbolism, of circumstantial evidence, of testimonial supermanence.
What occupied the position originally occupied by the sideboard?
A vertical piano (Cadby) with exposed keyboard, its closed coffin supporting a pair of long yellow ladies' gloves and an emerald ashtray containing four consumed matches, a partly consumed cigarette and two discoloured ends of cigarettes, its musicrest supporting the music in the key of G natural for voice and piano of Love's Old Sweet Song (words by G. Clifton Bingham, composed by J. L. Molloy, sung by Madam Antoinette Sterling) open at the last page with the final indications ad libitum, forte, pedal, animato, sustained, pedal, ritirando, close.
With what sensations did Bloom contemplate in rotation these objects?
With strain, elevating a candlestick: with pain, feeling on his right temple a contused tumescence: with attention, focusing his gaze on a large dull passive and slender bright active: with solicitation, bending and downturning the upturned rugfringe: with amusement, remembering Dr Malachi Mulligan's scheme of colour containing the gradation of green: with pleasure, repeating the words and antecedent act and perceiving through various channels of internal sensibility the consequent and concomitant tepid pleasant diffusion of gradual discolouration.
His next proceeding?
From an open box on the majolicatopped table he extracted a black diminutive cone, one inch in height, placed it on its circular base on a small tin plate, placed his candlestick on the right corner of the mantelpiece, produced from his waistcoat a folded page of prospectus (illustrated) entitled Agendath Netaim, unfolded the same, examined it superficially, rolled it into a thin cylinder, ignited it in the candleflame, applied it when ignited to the apex of the cone till the latter reached the stage of rutilance, placed the cylinder in the basin of the candlestick disposing its unconsumed part in such a manner as to facilitate total combustion.
What followed this operation?
That truncated conical crater summit of the diminutive volcano emitted a vertical and serpentine fume redolent of aromatic oriental incense.
What homothetic objects, other than the candlestick, stood on the mantelpiece?
A timepiece of striated Connemara marble, stopped at the hour of 4.46 a.m. on the 21 March 1896, matrimonial gift of Matthew Dillon: a dwarf tree of glacial arborescence under a transparent bellshade, matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle: an embalmed owl, matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper.
What interchanges of looks took place between these three objects and Bloom?
In the mirror of the giltbordered pierglass the undecorated back of the dwarf tree regarded the upright back of the embalmed owl. Before the mirror the matrimonial gift of Alderman John Hooper with a clear melancholy wise bright motionless compassionate gaze regarded Bloom while Bloom with obscure tranquil profound motionless compassionated gaze regarded the matrimonial gift of Luke and Caroline Doyle.
What composite asymmetrical image in the mirror then attracted his attention?
The image of a solitary (ipsorelative) mutable (aliorelative) man.
Why solitary (ipsorelative)?
Brothers and sisters had he none,
Yet that man's father was his grandfather's son.
Why mutable (aliorelative)?
From infancy to maturity he had resembled his maternal procreatrix. From maturity to senility he would increasingly resemble his paternal creator.
What final visual impression was communicated to him by the mirror?
The optical reflection of several inverted volumes improperly arranged and not in the order of their common letters with scintillating titles on the two bookshelves opposite.

What reflections occupied his mind during the process of reversion of the inverted volumes?
The necessity of order, a place for everything and everything in its place: the deficient appreciation of literature possessed by females: the incongruity of an apple incuneated in a tumbler and of an umbrella inclined in a closestool: the insecurity of hiding any secret document behind, beneath or between the pages of a book.
Which volume was the largest in bulk?
Hozier's History of the Russo - Turkish War.
What among other data did the second volume of the work In question contain?
The name of a decisive battle (forgotten), frequently remembered by a decisive officer, major Brian Cooper Tweedy (remembered).
Why, firstly and secondly, did he not consult the work in question?
Firstly, in order to exercise mnemotechnic: secondly, because after an interval of amnesia, when seated at the central table, about to consult the work in question, he remembered by mnemotechnic the name of the military engagement, Plevna.
What caused him consolation in his sitting posture?
The candour, nudity, pose, tranquillity, youth, grace, sex, counsel of a statue erect in the centre of the table, an image of Narcissus purchased by auction from P. A. Wren, 9 Bachelor's Walk.
What caused him irritation in his sitting posture?
Inhibitory pressure of collar (size 17) and waistcoat (5 buttons), two articles of clothing superfluous in the costume of mature males and inelastic to alterations of mass by expansion.
How was the irritation allayed?
He removed his collar, with contained black necktie and collapsible stud, from his neck to a position on the left of the table. He unbuttoned successively in reversed direction waistcoat, trousers, shirt and vest along the medial line of irregular incrispated black hair extending in triangular convergence from the pelvic basin over the circumference of the abdomen and umbilicular fossicle along the medial line of nodes to the intersection of the sixth pectoral vertebr?, thence produced both ways at right angles and terminating in circles described about two equidistant points, right and left, on the summits of the mammary prominences. He unbraced successively each of six minus one braced trouser buttons, arranged in pairs, of which one incomplete.
What involuntary actions followed?
He compressed between 2 fingers the flesh circumjacent to a cicatrice in the left infracostal region below the diaphragm resulting from a sting inflicted 2 weeks and 3 days previously (23 May 1904) by a bee. He scratched imprecisely with his right hand, though insensible of prurition, various points and surfaces of his partly exposed, wholly abluted skin. He inserted his left hand into the left lower pocket of his waistcoat and extracted and replaced a silver coin (1 shilling), placed there (presumably) on the occasion (17 October 1903) of the interment of Mrs Emily Sinico, Sydney Parade.

Did the process of divestiture continue?
Sensible of a benignant persistent ache in his footsoles he extended his foot to one side and observed the creases, protuberances and salient points caused by foot pressure in the course of walking repeatedly in several different directions, then, inclined, he disnoded the laceknots, unhooked and loosened the laces, took off each of his two boots for the second time, detached the partially moistened right sock through the fore part of which the nail of his great toe had again effracted, raised his right foot and, having unhooked a purple elastic sock suspender, took off his right sock, placed his unclothed right foot on the margin of the seat of his chair, picked at and gently lacerated the protruding part of the great toenail, raised the part lacerated to his nostrils and inhaled the odour of the quick, then with satisfaction threw away the lacerated unguinal fragment.
Why with satisfaction?
Because the odour inhaled corresponded to other odours inhaled of other unguinal fragments, picked and lacerated by Master Bloom, pupil of Mrs Ellis's juvenile school, patiently each night in the act of brief genuflection and nocturnal prayer and ambitious meditation.
In what ultimate ambition had all concurrent and consecutive ambitions now coalesced?
Not to inherit by right of primogeniture, gavelkind or borough English, or possess in perpetuity an extensive demesne of a sufficient number of acres, roods and perches, statute land measure (valuation #42), of grazing turbary surrounding a baronial hall with gatelodge and carriage drive nor, on the other hand, a terracehouse or semidetached villa, described as Rus in Urbe or Qui si Sana, but to purchase by private treaty in fee simple a thatched bungalowshaped 2 storey dwellinghouse of southerly aspect, surmounted by vane and lightning conductor, connected with the earth, with porch covered by parasitic plants (ivy or Virginia creeper), halldoor, olive green, with smart carriage finish and neat doorbrasses, stucco front with gilt tracery at eaves and gable, rising, if possible, upon a gentle eminence with agreeable prospect from balcony with stone pillar parapet over unoccupied and unoccupyable interjacent pastures and standing in 5 or 6 acres of its own ground, at such a distance from the nearest public thoroughfare as to render its houselights visible at night above and through a quickset hornbeam hedge of topiary cutting, situate at a given point not less than 1 statute mile from the periphery of the metropolis, within a time limit of not more than 5 minutes from tram or train line (e.g., Dundrum, south, or Sutton, north, both localities equally reported by trial to resemble the terrestrial poles in being favourable climates for phthisical subjects), the premises to be held under feefarmgrant, lease 999 years, the message to consist of 1 drawingroom with baywindow (2 lancets), thermometer affixed, 1 sittingroom, 4 bedrooms, 2 servants rooms, tiled kitchen with close range and scullery, lounge hall fitted with linen wallpresses, fumed oak sectional bookcase containing the Encyclopaedia Britannica and New century Dictionary, transverse obsolete medieval and oriental weapons, dinner gong, alabaster lamp, bowl pendant, vulcanite automatic telephone receiver with adjacent directory, handtufted Axminster carpet with cream ground and trellis border, loo table with pillar and claw legs, hearth with massive firebrasses and ormolu mantel chronometer clock, guaranteed timekeeper with cathedral chime, barometer with hygrographic chart, comfortable lounge settees and corner fitments, upholstered in ruby plush with good springing and sunk centre, three banner Japanese screen and cuspidors (club style, rich wine-coloured leather, gloss renewable with a minimum of labour by use of linseed oil and vinegar) and pyramidically prismatic central chandelier lustre, bentwood perch with a fingertame parrot (expurgated language), embossed mural paper at 10/-per dozen with transverse swags of carmine floral design and top crown frieze, staircase, three continuous flights at successive right angles, of varnished cleargrained oak, treads and risers, newel, balusters and handrail, with stepped-up panel dado, dressed with camphorated wax, bathroom, hot and cold supply, reclining and shower: water closet on mezzanine provided with opaque singlepane oblong window, tipup seat, bracket lamp, brass tierod brace, armrests, footstool and artistic oleograph on inner face of door: ditto, plain: servant's apartments with separate sanitary and hygienic necessaries for cook, general and betweenmaid (salary, rising by biennial unearned increments of #2, with comprehensive fidelity insurance annual bonus (#1), and retiring allowance (based on the 65 system) after 30 years service), pantry, buttery, larder, refrigerator, outoffices, coal and wood cellarage with winebin (still and sparkling vintages) for distinguished guests, if entertained to dinner (evening dress), carbon monoxide gas supply throughout.

When countrybound velocipedes, a chainless freewheel roadster cycle with side basketcar attached, or draught conveyance, a donkey with wicker trap or smart phaeton with good working solidungular cob (roan gelding, 14h).
What might be the name of this erigible or erected residence?
Bloom Cottage. Saint Leopold's. Flowerville.
Could Bloom of 7 Eccles street foresee Bloom of Flowerville?
In loose allwool garments with Harris tweed cap, price 8/6, and useful garden boots with elastic gussets and wateringcan, planting aligned young firtrees, syringing, pruning, staking, sowing hayseed, trundling a weedladen wheelbarrow without excessive fatigue at sunset amid the scent of newmown hay, ameliorating the soil, multiplying wisdom, achieving longevity.
What syllabus of intellectual pursuits was simultaneously possible?
Snapshot photography, comparative study of religions, folklore relative to various amatory and superstitious practices, contemplation of the celestial constellations.
What lighter recreations?
Outdoor: garden and fieldwork, cycling on level macadamised causeways, ascents of moderately high hills, natation in secluded fresh water and unmolested river boating in secure wherry or light curricle with kedge anchor on reaches free from weirs and rapids (period of estivation), vespertinal perambulation or equestrian circumprocession with inspection of sterile landscape and contrastingly agreeable cottagers' fires of smoking peat turves (period of hibernation). Indoor discussion in tepid security of unsolved historical and criminal problems: lecture of unexpurgated exotic erotic masterpieces: house carpentry with toolbox containing hammer, awl, nails, screws, tintacks, gimlet, tweezers, bullnose plane and turnscrew.
Might he become a gentleman farmer of field produce and live stock?
Not impossibly, with 1 or 2 stripper cows, 1 pike of upland hay and requisite farming implements, e.g., an end-to-end churn, a turnip pulper etc.
What would be his civic functions and social status among the county families and landed gentry?
Arranged successively in ascending powers of hierarchical order, that of gardener, groundsman, cultivator, breeder, and at the zenith of his career, resident magistrate or justice of the peace with a family crest and coat of arms and appropriate classical motto (Semper paratus), duly recorded in the court directory (Bloom, Leopold P., M. P., P. C., K. P., L. L. D. honoris cause, Bloomville, Dundrum) and mentioned in court and fashionable intelligence (Mr and Mrs Leopold Bloom have left Kingstown for England).
What course of action did he outline for himself in such capacity?
A course that lay between undue clemency and excessive rigour: the dispensation in a heterogeneous society of arbitrary classes, incessantly rearranged in terms of greater and lesser social inequality of unbiassed homogeneous indisputable justice, tempered with mitigants of the widest possible latitude but exactable to the uttermost farthing with confiscation of estate, real and personal, to the crown. Loyal to the highest constituted power in the land, actuated by an innate love of rectitude his aims would be the strict maintenance of public order, the repression of many abuses though not of all simultaneously (every measure of reform or retrenchment being a preliminary solution to be contained by fluxion in the final solution), the upholding of the letter of the law (common, statute and law merchant) against all traversers in covin and trespassers acting in contravention of bylaws and regulations, all resuscitators (by trespass and petty larceny of kindlings) of venville rights, obsolete by desuetude, all orotund instigators of international persecution, all perpetuators of international animosities, all menial molestors of domestic conviviality, all recalcitrant violators of domestic connubiality.
Prove that he had loved rectitude from his earliest youth.
To master Percy Apjohn at High School in 1880 he had divulged his disbelief in the tenets of the Irish (protestant) church (to which his father Rudolf Virag, later Rudolph Bloom, had been converted from the Israelitic faith and communion in 1865 by the Society for promoting Christianity among the Jews) subsequently abjured by him in favour of Roman catholicism at the epoch of and with a view to his matrimony in 1888. To Daniel Magrane and Francis Wade in 1882 during a juvenile friendship (terminated by the premature emigration of the former) he had advocated during nocturnal perambulations the political theory of colonial (e.g. Canadian) expansion and the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin, expounded in The Descent of Man and The Origin of Species. In 1885 he had publicly expressed his adherence to the collective and national economic programme advocated by James Fintan Lalor, John Fisher Murray, John Mitchel, J. F. X. O'Brien and others, the agrarian policy of Michael Davitt, the constitutional agitation of Charles Stewart Parnell (M. P. for Cork City), the programme of peace, retrenchment and reform of William Ewart Gladstone (M. P. for Midlothian, N. B.) and, in support of his political convictions, had climbed up into a secure position amid the ramifications of a tree on Northumberland road to see the entrance (2 February 1888) into the capital of a demonstrative torchlight procession of 20,000, divided into 120 trade corporations, bearing 2,000 torches in escort of the marquess of Ripon and John Morley.
How much and how did he propose to pay for this country residence?
As per prospectus of the Industrious Foreign Acclimatised Nationalised Friendly Stateaided Building Society (incorporated 1874), a maximum of #60 per annum, being 116th of an assured income, derived from giltedged securities, representing at 5% simple interest on capital of #1,200 (estimate of price at 20 years purchase) of which 1/3rd to be paid on acquisition and the balance in the form of annual rent, viz. #800 plus 2 1/2% interest on the same, repayable quarterly in equal annual instalments until extinction by amortisation of loan advanced for purchase within a period of 20 years, amounting to an annual rental of #64, headrent included, the titledeeds to remain in possession of the lender or lenders with a saving clause envisaging forced sale, foreclosure and mutual compensation in the event of protracted failure to pay the terms assigned, otherwise the messuage to become the absolute property of the tenant occupier upon expiry of the period of years stipulated.
What rapid but insecure means to opulence might facilitate immediate purchase?
A private wireless telegraph which would transmit by dot and dash system the result of a national equine handicap (flat or steeplechase) of 1 or more miles and furlongs won by an outsider at odds of 50 to 1 at 3 hr. 8 m. p.m. at Ascot (Greenwich time) the message being received and available for betting purposes in Dublin at 2.59 p.m. (Dunsink time). The unexpected discovery of an object of great monetary value: precious stone, valuable adhesive or impressed postage stamps (7-shilling, mauve, imperforate, Hamburg, 1866: 4 pence, rose, blue paper perforate, Great Britain, 1866: 1 franc, stone, official, rouletted, diagonal surcharge, Luxembourg, 1878): antique dynastical ring, unique relic in unusual repositories or by unusual means: from the air (dropped by an eagle in flight), by fire (amid the carbonised remains of an incendiated edifice), in the sea (amid flotsam, jetsam, lagan and derelict), on earth (in the gizzard of a comestible fowl). A Spanish prisoner's donation of a distant treasure of valuables or specie or bullion lodged with a solvent banking corporation 100 years previously at 5% compound interest of the collective worth of #5,000,000 stg (five million pounds sterling). A contract with an inconsiderate contractee for the delivery of 32 consignments of some given commodity in consideration of cash payment on delivery at the initial rate of 1/4d. to be increased constantly in the geometrical progression of 2 (1/4d., 1/2d., 1d., 2d., 4d., 8d., 1s. 4d., 2s. 8d. to 32 terms). A prepared scheme based on a study of the laws of probability to break the bank at Monte Carlo. A solution of the secular problem of the quadrature of the circle, government premium #1,000,000 sterling.
Was vast wealth acquirable through industrial channels?
The reclamation of dunams of waste arenary soil, proposed in the prospectus of Agendath Netaim, Bleibtreustrasse, Berlin, W.15 by the cultivation of orange plantations and melonfields and reafforestation. The utilisation of waste paper, fells of sewer rodents, human excrement possessing chemical properties, in view of the vast production of the first, vast number of the second and immense quantity of the third, every normal human being of average vitality and appetite producing annually, cancelling byproducts of water, a sum total of 80 lbs. (mixed animal and vegetable diet), to be multiplied by 4,386,035 the total population of Ireland according to the census returns of 1901.
Were there schemes of wider scope?
A scheme to be formulated and submitted for approval to the harbour commissioners for the exploitation of white coal (hydraulic power), obtained by hydroelectric plant at peak of tide at Dublin bar or at head of water at Poulaphouca or Powerscourt or catchment basins of main streams for the economic production of 500,000 W. H. P. of electricity. A scheme to enclose the peninsular delta of the North Bull at Dollymount and erect on the space of the foreland, used for golf links and rifle ranges, an asphalted esplanade with casinos, booths, shooting galleries, hotels, boardinghouses, readingrooms, establishments for mixed bathing. A scheme for the use of dogvans and goatvans for the delivery of early morning milk. A scheme for the development of Irish tourist traffic in and around Dublin by means of petrolpropelled riverboats, plying in the fluvial fairway between island bridge and Ringsend, charabancs, narrow gauge local railways, and pleasure steamers for coastwise navigation (10/- per person per day, guide (trilingual) included). A scheme for the repristination of passenger and goods traffics over Irish waterways, when freed from weedbeds. A scheme to connect by tramline the Cattle Market (North Circular road and Prussia street) with the quays (Sheriff street, lower, and East Wall), parallel with the Link line railway laid (in conjunction with the Great Southern and Western railway line) between the cattle park, Liffey junction, and terminus of Midland Great Western railway 43 to 45 North Wall, in proximity to the terminal stations or Dublin branches of Great Central Railway, Midland Railway of England, City of Dublin Steam Packet Company, Lancashire Yorkshire Railway Company, Dublin and Glasgow Steam Packet Company, Glasgow Dublin and Londonderry Steam Packet Company (Laird line), British and Irish Steam Packet Company, Dublin and Morecambe Steamers, London and North Western Railway Company, Dublin Port and Docks Board Landing Sheds and transit sheds of Palgrave, Murphy and Company, steamship owners, agents for steamers from Mediterranean, Spain, Portugal, France, Belgium and Holland and for animal transport and of additional mileage operated by the Dublin United Tramways Company, limited, to be covered by graziers' fees.
Positing what protasis would the contraction for such several schemes become a natural and necessary apodosis?
Given a guarantee equal to the sum sought, the support, by deed of gift and transfer vouchers during donor's lifetime or by bequest after donor's painless extinction, of eminent financiery (Blum Pasha, Rothschild, Guggenheim, Hirsch, Montefiore, Morgan, Rockefeller) possessing fortunes in 6 figures, amassed during a successful life, and joining capital with opportunity the thing required was done.
What eventually would render him independent of such wealth?
The independent discovery of a goldseam of inexhaustible ore.
For what reason did he meditate on schemes so difficult of realisation?
It was one of his axioms that similar meditations or the automatic relation to himself of a narrative concerning himself or tranquil recollection of the past when practised habitually before retiring for the night alleviated fatigue and produced as a result sound repose and renovated vitality.
His justifications?
As a physicist he had learned that of the 70 years of complete human life at least 2/7ths, viz., 20 years passed in sleep. As a philosopher he knew that at the termination of any allotted life only an infinitesimal part of any person's desires has been realised. As a physiologist he believed in the artificial placation of malignant agencies chiefly operative during somnolence.
What did he fear?
The committal of homicide or suicide during sleep by an aberration of the light of reason, the incommensurable categorical intelligence situated in the cerebral convolutions.
What were habitually his final meditations?
Of some one sole unique advertisement to cause passers to stop in wonder, a poster novelty, with all extraneous accretions excluded, reduced to its simplest and most efficient terms not exceeding the span of casual vision and congruous with the velocity of modern life.
What did the first drawer unlocked contain?

Quote the textual terms of this notice.
I, Rudolph Virag, now resident at no 52 Clanbrassil street, Dublin, formerly of Szombathely in the kingdom of Hungary, hereby give notice that I have assumed and intend henceforth upon all occasions and at all times to be known by the name of Rudolph Bloom.
What other objects relative to Rudolph Bloom (born Virag) were in the 2nd drawer?
An indistinct daguerreotype of Rudolph Virag and his father Leopold Virag executed in the year 1852 in the portrait atelier of their (respectively) 1st and 2nd cousin, Stefan Virag of Szesfehervar, Hungary. An ancient hagadah book in which a pair of hornrimmed convex spectacles inserted marked the passage of thanksgiving in the ritual prayers for Pessach (Passover): a photocard of the Queen's Hotel, Ennis, proprietor, Rudolph Bloom: an envelope addressed To my Dear Son Leopold.
What fractions of phrases did the lecture of those five whole words evoke?
Tomorrow will be a week that I received... it is no use Leopold to be... with your dear mother... that is not more to stand... to her... all for me is out... be kind to Athos, Leopold... my dear son... always... of me... das Herr... Gott... dein...
What reminiscences of a human subject suffering from progressive melancholia did these objects evoke in Bloom?
An old man widower, unkempt hair, in bed, with head covered, sighing: an infirm dog, Athos: aconite, resorted to by increasing doses of grains and scruples as a palliative of recrudescent neuralgia: the face in death of a septuagenarian suicide by poison.
Why did Bloom experience a sentiment of remorse?
Because in immature impatience he had treated with disrespect certain beliefs and practices.
As?
The prohibition of the use of fleshmeat and milk at one meal, the hebdomadary symposium of incoordinately abstract, perfervidly concrete mercantile coexreligionist excompatriots: the circumcision of male infants: the supernatural character of Judaic scripture: the ineffability of the tetragrammaron: the sanctity of the sabbath.
How did these beliefs and practices now appear to him?
Not more rational than they had then appeared, not less rational than other beliefs and practices now appeared.
What first reminiscence had he of Rudolph Bloom (deceased)?
Rudolph Bloom (deceased) narrated to his son Leopold Bloom (aged 6) a retrospective arrangement of migrations and settlements in and between Dublin, London, Florence, Milan, Vienna, Budapest, Szombathely, with statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen Maria Theresa, empress of Austria, queen of Hungary), with commercial advice (having taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves). Leopold Bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant consultation of a geographical map of Europe (political) and by suggestions for the establishment of affiliated business premises in the various centres mentioned.
Had time equally but differently obliterated the memory of these migrations in narrator and listener?
In narrator by the access of years and in consequence of the use of narcotic toxin: in listener by the access of years and in consequence of the action of distraction upon vicarious experiences.
What idiosyncrasies of the narrator were concomitant products of amnesia?
Occasionally he ate without having previously removed his hat. Occasionally he drank voraciously the juice of gooseberry fool from an inclined plate. Occasionally he removed from his lips the traces of food by means of a lacerated envelope or other accessible fragment of paper.
What two phenomena of senescence were more frequent?
The myopic digital calculation of coins, eructation consequent upon repletion.
What object offered partial consolation for these reminiscences?
The endowment policy, the bank passbook, the certificate of the possession of scrip.
Reduce Bloom by cross multiplication of reverses of fortune, from which these supports protected him, and by elimination of all positive values to a negligible negative irrational unreal quantity.
Successively, in descending helotic order: Poverty: that of the outdoor hawker of imitation jewellery, the dun for the recovery of bad and doubtful debts, the poor rate and deputy cess collector. Mendicancy: that of the fraudulent bankrupt with negligible assets paying 1s. 4d. in the #, sandwichman, distributor of throwaways, nocturnal vagrant, insinuating sycophant, maimed sailor, blind stripling, superannuated bailiff's man, marfeast, lickplate, spoilsport, pickthank, eccentric public laughingstock seated on bench of public park under discarded perforated umbrella. Destitution: the inmate of Old Man's House (Royal Hospital), Kilmainham, the inmate of Simpson's Hospital for reduced but respectable men permanently disabled by gout or want of sight. Nadir of misery: the aged impotent disfranchised ratesupported moribund lunatic pauper.
With which attendant indignities?
The unsympathetic indifference of previously amiable females, the contempt of muscular males, the acceptance of fragments of bread, the simulated ignorance of casual acquaintances, the latration of illegitimate unlicensed vagabond dogs, the infantile discharge of decomposed vegetable missiles, worth little or nothing or less than nothing.
By what could such a situation be precluded?
By decease (change of state), by departure (change of place).
Which preferably?
The latter, by the line of least resistance.
What considerations rendered it not entirely undesirable?
Constant cohabitation impeding mutual toleration of personal defects. The habit of independent purchase increasingly cultivated. The necessity to counteract by impermanent sojourn the permanence of arrest.
What considerations rendered it not irrational?
The parties concerned, uniting, had increased and multiplied, which being done, offspring produced and educed to maturity, the parties, if now disunited were obliged to reunite for increase and multiplication, which was absurd, to form by reunion the original couple of uniting parties, which was impossible.
What considerations rendered it desirable?
The attractive character of certain localities in Ireland and abroad, as represented in general geographical maps of polychrome design or in special ordnance survey charts by employment of scale numerals and hachures.
In Ireland?
The cliffs of Moher, the windy wilds of Connemara, lough Neagh with submerged petrified city, the Giant's Causeway, Fort Camden and Fort Carlisle, the Golden Vale of Tipperary, the islands of Aran, the pastures of royal Meath, Brigid's elm in Kildare, the Queen's Island shipyard in Belfast, the Salmon Leap, the lakes of Killarney.
Abroad?
Ceylon (with spicegardens supplying tea to Thomas Kernan, agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 2 Mincing lane, London, E. C., 5 Dame street, Dublin), Jerusalem, the holy city (with mosque of Omar and gate of Damascus, goal of aspiration), the straits of Gibraltar (the unique birthplace of Marion Tweedy), the Parthenon (containing statues, nude Grecian divinities), the Wall street money market (which controlled international finance), the Plaza de Toros at La Linea, Spain (where O'Hara of the camerons had slain the bull), Niagara (over which no human being had passed with impunity), the land of the Eskimos (eaters of soap), the forbidden country of Thibet (from which no traveller returns), the bay of Naples (to see which was to die), the Dead Sea.
Under what guidance, following what signs?
At sea, septentrional, by night the polestar, located at the point of intersection of the right line from beta to alpha in Ursa Major produced and divided externally at omega and the hypotenuse of the rightangled triangle formed by the line alpha omega so produced and the line alpha delta of Ursa Major. On land, meridional, a bispherical moon, revealed in imperfect varying phases of lunation through the posterior interstice of the imperfectly occluded skirt of a carnose negligent perambulating female, a pillar of the cloud by day.
What public advertisement would divulge the occultation of the departed?
#5 reward lost, stolen or strayed from his residence 7 Eccles street, missing gent about 40, answering to the name of Bloom, Leopold (Poldy), height 5 ft 9 1/2 inches, full build, olive complexion, may have since grown a beard, when last seen was wearing a black suit. Above sum will be paid for information leading to his discovery.
What universal binomial denominations would be his as entity and nonentity?
Assumed by any or known to none. Everyman or Noman.
What tributes his?
Honour and gifts of strangers, the friends of Everyman. A nymph immortal, beauty, the bride of Noman.
Would the departed never nowhere nohow reappear?
Ever he would wander, selfcompelled, to the extreme limit of his cometary orbit, beyond the fixed stars and variable suns and telescopic planets, astronomical waifs and strays, to the extreme boundary of space, passing from land to land, among peoples, amid events. Somewhere imperceptibly he would hear and somehow reluctantly, suncompelled, obey the summons of recall. Whence, disappearing from the constellation of the Northern Crown he would somehow reappear reborn above delta in the constellation of Cassiopeia and after incalculable eons of peregrination return an estranged avenger, a wreaker of justice on malefactors, a dark crusader, a sleeper awakened, with financial resources (by supposition) surpassing those of Rothschild or of the silver King.
What would render such return irrational?
An unsatisfactory equation between an exodus and return in time through reversible space and an exodus and return in space through irreversible time.
What play of forces, inducing inertia, rendered departure undesirable?
The lateness of the hour, rendering procrastinatory: the obscurity of the night, rendering invisible: the uncertainty of thoroughfares, rendering perilous: the necessity for repose, obviating movement: the proximity of an occupied bed, obviating research: the anticipation of warmth (human) tempered with coolness (linen), obviating desire and rendering desirable: the statue of Narcissus, sound without echo, desired desire.
What advantages were possessed by an occupied, as distinct from an unoccupied bed?
The removal of nocturnal solitude, the superior quality of human (mature female) to inhuman (hotwaterjar) calefaction, the stimulation of matutinal contact, the economy of mangling done on the premises in the case of trousers accurately folded and placed lengthwise between the spring mattress (striped) and the woollen mattress (biscuit section).
What past consecutive causes, before rising preapprehended, of accumulated fatigue did Bloom, before rising, silently recapitulate?
The preparation of breakfast (burnt offering): intestinal congestion and premeditative defecation (holy of holies): the bath (rite of John): the funeral (rite of Samuel): the advertisement of Alexander Keyes (Urim and Thummin): the unsubstantial lunch (rite of Melchizedek): the visit to museum and national library (holy place): the bookhunt along Bedford row, Merchants' Arch, Wellington Quay (Simchath Torah): the music in the Ormond Hotel (Shira Shirim): the altercation with a truculent troglodyte in Bernard Kiernan's premises (holocaust): a blank period of time including a cardrive, a visit to a house of mourning, a leavetaking (wilderness): the eroticism produced by feminine exhibitionism (rite of Onan): the prolonged delivery of Mrs Mina Purefoy (heave offering): the visit to the disorderly house of Mrs Bella Cohen, 82 Tyrone street, lower, and subsequent brawl and chance medley in Beaver street (Armageddon): nocturnal perambulation to and from the cabman's shelter, Butt Bridge (atonement).
What selfimposed enigma did Bloom about to rise in order to go so as to conclude lest he should not conclude involuntarily apprehend?
The cause of a brief sharp unforeseen heard loud lone crack emitted by the insentient material of a strainveined timber table.
What selfinvolved enigma did Bloom risen, going, gathering multicoloured multiform multitudinous garments, voluntarily apprehending, not comprehend?
Who was M'Intosh?
What selfevident enigma pondered with desultory constancy during 30 years did Bloom now, having effected natural obscurity by the extinction of artificial light, silently suddenly comprehend?
Where was Moses when the candle went out?
What imperfections in a perfect day did Bloom, walking, silently, successively, enumerate?
A provisional failure to obtain renewal of an advertisement, to obtain a certain quantity of tea from Thomas Kernan (agent for Pulbrook, Robertson and Co, 5 Dame street, Dublin, and 2 Mincing lane, London, E. C.), to certify the presence or absence of posterior rectal orifice in the case of Hellenic female divinities, to obtain admission (gratuitous or paid) to the performance of Leah by Mrs Bandman Palmer at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49, South King street.
What impression of an absent face did Bloom, arrested, silently recall?
The face of her father, the late Major Brian Cooper Tweedy, Royal Dublin Fusiliers, of Gibraltar and Rehoboth, Dolphin's Barn.
What recurrent impressions of the same were possible by the hypothesis?
Retreating, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, with constant uniform acceleration, along parallel lines meeting at infinity, if produced: along parallel lines, reproduced from infinity, with constant uniform retardation, at the terminus of the Great Northern Railway, Amiens street, returning.
What miscellaneous effects of female personal wearing apparel were perceived by him?
A pair of new inodorous halfsilk black ladies' hose, a pair of new violet garters, a pair of outsize ladies' drawers of India mull, cut on generous lines, redolent of opoponax, jessamine and Muratti's Turkish cigarettes and containing a long bright steel safety pin, folded curvilinear, a camisole of baptiste with thin lace border, an accordion underskirt of blue silk moirette, all these objects being disposed irregularly on the top of a rectangular trunk, quadruple battened, having capped corners, with multicoloured labels, initialled on its fore side in white lettering B. C. T. (Brian Cooper Tweedy).
What impersonal objects were perceived?
A commode, one leg fractured, totally covered by square cretonne cutting, apple design, on which rested a lady's black straw hat. Orangekeyed ware, bought of Henry Price, basket, fancy goods, chinaware and ironmongery manufacturer, 21, 22, 23 Moore street, disposed irregularly on the washstand and floor, and consisting of basin, soapdish and brushtray (on the washstand, together), pitcher and night article (on the floor, separate).
Bloom's acts?
He deposited the articles of clothing on a chair, removed his remaining articles of clothing, took from beneath the bolster at the head of the bed a folded long white nightshirt, inserted his head and arms into the proper apertures of the nightshirt, removed a pillow from the head to the foot of the bed, prepared the bedlinen accordingly and entered the bed.
How?
With circumspection, as invariably when entering an abode (his own or not his own): with solicitude, the snakespiral springs of the mattress being old, the brass quoits and pendent viper radii loose and tremulous under stress and strain: prudently, as entering a lair or ambush of lust or adder: lightly, the less to disturb: reverently, the bed of conception and of birth, of consummation of marriage and of breach of marriage, of sleep and of death.
What did his limbs, when gradually extended, encounter?
New clean bedlinen, additional odours, the presence of a human form, female, hers, the imprint of a human form, male, not his, some crumbs, some flakes of potted meat, recooked, which he removed.
If he had smiled why would he have smiled?
To reflect that each one who enters imagines himself to be the first to enter whereas he is always the last term of a preceding series even if the first term of a succeeding one, each imagining himself to be first, last, only and alone, whereas he is neither first nor last nor only nor alone in a series originating In and repeated to infinity.
What preceding series?
Assuming Mulvey to be the first term of his series, Penrose, Bartell d'Arcy, professor Goodwin, Julius Mastiansky, John Henry Menton, Father Bernard Corrigan, a farmer at the Royal Dublin Society's Horse Show, Maggot O'Reilly, Matthew Dillon, Valentine Blake Dillon (Lord Mayor of Dublin), Christopher Callinan, Lenehan, an Italian organgrinder, an unknown gentleman in the Gaiety Theatre, Benjamin Dollard, Simon Dedalus, Andrew (Pisser) Burke, Joseph Cuffe, Wisdom Hely, Alderman John Hooper, Dr Francis Brady, Father Sebastian of Mount Argus, a bootblack at the General Post Office, Hugh E. (Blazes) Boylan and so each and so on to nolast term.
What were his reflections concerning the last member of this series and late occupant of the bed?
Reflections on his vigour (a bounder), corporal proportion (a billsticker), commercial ability (a bester), impressionability (a boaster).
Why for the observer impressionability in addition to vigour, corporal proportion and commercial ability?
Because he had observed with augmenting frequency in the preceding members of the same series the same concupiscence, inflammably transmitted first with alarm, then with understanding, then with desire, finally with fatigue, with alternating symptoms of epicene comprehension and apprehension.
With what antagonistic sentiments were his subsequent reflections affected?
Envy, jealousy, abnegation, equanimity.
Envy?
Of a bodily and mental male organism specially adapted for the superincumbent posture of energetic human copulation and energetic piston and cylinder movement necessary for the complete satisfaction of a constant but not acute concupiscence resident in a bodily and mental female organism, passive but not obtuse.
Jealousy?
Because a nature full and volatile in its free state, was alternately the agent and reagent of attraction. Because action between agents and reagents at all instants varied, with inverse proportion of increase and decrease, with incessant circular extension and radial reentrance. Because the controlled contemplation of the fluctuation of attraction produced, if desired, a fluctuation of pleasure.
Abnegation?
In virtue of a) acquaintance initiated in September 1903 in the establishment of George Mesias, merchant tailor and outfitter, 5 Eden Quay, b) hospitality extended and received in kind, reciprocated and reappropriated in person, c) comparative youth subject to impulses of ambition and magnanimity, colleagual altruism and amorous egoism, d) extraracial attraction, intraracial inhibition, supraracial prerogative, e) an imminent provincial musical tour, common current expenses, net proceeds divided.
Equanimity?
As natural as any and every natural act of a nature expressed or understood executed in natured nature by natural creatures in accordance with his, her and their natured natures, of dissimilar similarity. As not as calamitous as a cataclysmic annihilation of the planet in consequence of collision with a dark sun. As less reprehensible than theft, highway robbery, cruelty to children and animals, obtaining money under false pretences, forgery, embezzlement, misappropriation of public money, betrayal of public trust, malingering, mayhem, corruption of minors, criminal libel, blackmail, contempt of court, arson, treason, felony, mutiny on the high seas, trespass, burglary, jailbreaking, practice of unnatural vice, desertion from armed forces in the field, perjury, poaching, usury, intelligence with the king's enemies, impersonation, criminal assault, manslaughter, wilful and premeditated murder. As not more abnormal than all other altered processes of adaptation to altered conditions of existence, resulting in a reciprocal equilibrium between the bodily organism and its attendant circumstances, foods, beverages, acquired habits, indulged inclinations, significant disease. As more than inevitable, irreparable.
Why more abnegation than jealousy, less envy than equanimity?
From outrage (matrimony) to outrage (adultery) there arose nought but outrage (copulation) yet the matrimonial violator of the matrimonially violated had not been outraged by the adulterous violator of the adulterously violated.
What retribution, if any?
Assassination, never, as two wrongs did not make one right. Duel by combat, no. Divorce, not now. Exposure by mechanical artifice (automatic bed) or individual testimony (concealed ocular witness), not yet. Suit for damages by legal influence or simulation of assault with evidence of injuries sustained (selfinflicted), not impossibly. If any, positively, connivance, introduction of emulation (material, a prosperous rival agency of publicity: moral, a successful rival agent of intimacy), depreciation, alienation, humiliation, separation protecting the one separated from the other, protecting separator from both.
By what reflections did he, a conscious reactor against the void incertitude, justify to himself his sentiments?
The preordained frangibility of the hymen, the presupposed intangibility of the thing in itself: the incongruity and disproportion between the selfprolonging tension of the thing proposed to be done and the self abbreviating relaxation of the thing done: the fallaciously inferred debility of the female, the muscularity of the male: the variations of ethical codes: the natural grammatical transition by inversion involving no alteration of sense of an aorist preterite proposition (parsed as masculine subject, monosyllabic onomatopoeic transitive verb with direct feminine object) from the active voice into its correlative aorist preterite proposition (parsed as feminine subject, auxiliary verb and quasimonosyllabic onomatopoeic past participle with complementary masculine agent) in the passive voice: the continued product of seminators by generation: the continual production of semen by distillation: the futility of triumph or protest or vindication: the inanity of extolled virtue: the lethargy of nescient matter: the apathy of the stars.
In what final satisfaction did these antagonistic sentiments and reflections, reduced to their simplest forms, converge?
Satisfaction at the ubiquity in eastern and western terrestrial hemispheres, in all habitable lands and islands explored or unexplored (the land of the midnight sun, the islands of the blessed, the isles of Greece, the land of promise) of adipose posterior female hemispheres, redolent of milk and honey and of excretory sanguine and seminal warmth, reminiscent of secular families of curves of amplitude, insusceptible of moods of impression or of contrarieties of expression, expressive of mute immutable mature animality.
The visible signs of antesatisfaction?
An approximate erection: a solicitous adversion: a gradual elevation: a tentative revelation; a silent contemplation.
Then?
He kissed the plump mellow yellow smellow melons of her rump, on each plump melonous hemisphere, in their mellow yellow furrow, with obscure prolonged provocative melonsmellonous osculation.
The visible signs of postsatisfaction?
A silent contemplation: a tentative velation: a gradual abasement: a solicitous aversion: a proximate erection.
What followed this silent action?
Somnolent invocation, less somnolent recognition, incipient excitation, catechetical interrogation.
With what modifications did the narrator reply to this interrogation?
Negative: he omitted to mention the clandestine correspondence between Martha Clifford and Henry Flower, the public altercation at, in and in the vicinity of the licensed premises of Bernard Kiernan and Co, Limited, 8, 9 and 10 Little Britain street, the erotic provocation and response thereto caused by the exhibitionism of Gertrude (Gerty), surname unknown. Positive: he included mention of a performance by Mrs Bandman Palmer of Leah at the Gaiety Theatre, 46, 47, 48, 49 South King street, an invitation to supper at Wynn's (Murphy's) Hotel, 35, 36, and 37 Lower Abbey street, a volume of peccaminous pornographical tendency entitled Sweets of Sin, anonymous, author a gentleman of fashion, a temporary concussion caused by a falsely calculated movement in the course of postcenal gymnastic display, the victim (since completely recovered) being Stephen Dedalus, professor and author, eldest surviving son of Simon Dedalus, of no fixed occupation, an aeronautical feat executed by him (narrator) in the presence of a witness, the professor and author aforesaid, with promptitude of decision and gymnastic flexibility.
Was the narration otherwise unaltered by modifications?
Absolutely.
Which event or person emerged as the salient point of his narration?
Stephen Dedalus, professor and author.
What limitations of activity and inhibitions of conjugal rights were perceived by listener and narrator concerning themselves during the course of this intermittent and increasingly more laconic narration?
By the listener a limitation of fertility inasmuch as marriage had been celebrated 1 calendar month after the 18th anniversary of her birth (8 September 1870), viz. 8 October, and consummated on the same date with female issue born 15 June 1889, having been anticipatorily consummated on the 10 September of the same year and complete carnal intercourse, with ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ, having last taken place 5 weeks previous, viz. 27 November 1893, to the birth on 29 December 1893 of second (and only male) issue, deceased 9 January 1894, aged 11 days, there remained a period of 10 years, 5 months and 18 days during which carnal intercourse had been incomplete, without ejaculation of semen within the natural female organ. By the narrator a limitation of activity, mental and corporal, inasmuch as complete mental intercourse between himself and the listener had not taken place since the consummation of puberty, indicated by catamenic hemorrhage, of the female issue of narrator and listener, 15 September 1903, there remained a period of 9 months and 1 day during which in consequence of a preestablished natural comprehension in incomprehension between the consummated females (listener and issue), complete corporal liberty of action had been circumscribed.
How?
By various reiterated feminine interrogation concerning the masculine destination whither, the place where, the time at which, the duration for which, the object with which in the case of temporary absences, projected or effected.
What moved visibly above the listener's and the narrator's invisible thoughts?
The upcast reflection of a lamp and shade, an inconstant series of concentric circles of varying gradations of light and shadow.
In what directions did listener and narrator lie?
Listener, S. E. by E.; Narrator, N. W. by W.: on the 53rd parallel of latitude, N. and 6th meridian of longitude, W.: at an angle of 45ø to the terrestrial equator.
In what state of rest or motion?
At rest relatively to themselves and to each other. In motion being each and both carried westward, forward and rereward respectively, by the proper perpetual motion of the earth through everchanging tracks of neverchanging space.
In what posture?
Listener: reclined semilaterally, left, left hand under head, right leg extended in a straight line and resting on left leg, flexed, in the attitude of Gea-Tellus, fulfilled, recumbent, big with seed. Narrator: reclined laterally, left, with right and left legs flexed, the indexfinger and thumb of the right hand resting on the bridge of the nose, in the attitude depicted on a snapshot photograph made by Percy Apjohn, the childman weary, the manchild in the womb.
Womb? Weary?
He rests. He has travelled.
With?
Sinbad the Sailor and Tinbad the Tailor and Jinbad the Jailer and Whinbad the Whaler and Ninbad the Nailer and Finbad the Failer and Binbad the Bailer and Pinbad the Pailer and Minbad the Mailer and Hinbad the Hailer and Rinbad the Railer and Dinbad the Kailer and Vinbad the Quailer and Linbad the Yailer and Xinbad the Phthailer.
When?
Going to a dark bed there was a square round Sinbad the Sailor roc's auk's egg in the night of the bed of all the auks of the rocs of Darkinbad the Brightdayler.

A copy of the Address delivered by me, on the 24th of October last, before the inhabi-
tants of the town of Braintree, is, in compliance with their obliging request, submitted to
your disposal, by your friend and fellow-citizen,
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS.

TO THE
INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN OF BRAINTREE,
THIS
DISCOURSE ON EDUCATION,
DELIVERED AT THEIR REQUEST BEFORE THEM,
IS INSCRIBED AND DEDICATED TO THEM AND THEIR CHILDREN,
BY THEIR NATIVE TOWNSMAN,
AND AFFECTIONATE FELLOW CITIZEN,
JOHN QUINCY ADAMS,

DISCOURSE.

The celebrated Historian of England, David Hume,
in the account of his life written in the 65th year of his
age by himself, says, '' I am, or rather was (for that is the
style I must now use in speaking of myself, which em-
boldens me the more to speak my sentiments) ; I tvas, I
say, a man of mild disposition,"" &c. then giving his own
character, according to his own estimate of it.
Men and women of Braintree ! I have lived eight years
longer in this world of vicissitudes and cares, than David
Hume had lived when he felt himself bound to assume
this style, and when he considered it as investing him
with the privilege of speaking more boldly his sentiments,
than he might have done while speaking in the present
tense.
Am I not then authorised by his example, to invert the
order of his transition from the present to the past, and to
say — I was or rather I am one of yourselves ? I was born
at Braintree ; and in the revolution of time, I am, one of
the oldest inhabitants of that Town. In Braintree I first
beheld the light of Heaven — first breathed the atmosphere
of your granite rocks — first sucked with my mother's
milk the love of Liberty, and the reverence for the Gospel
of truth. In early childhood, in the midst of the storm
of the war of Independence, in the dead of Winter, I
embarked at the very spot where your forefathers landed

at the foot of Mount Wollaston — I embarked, with a
father, upon the tempestuous ocean, for realms beyond the
Atlantic tide ; defying the battle and the breeze for the
cause of your Country. Since then, for a space of forty
years I led a wandering life, in distant regions ; always in
the service of your fathers or in yours ; always grateful to
Heaven for having made me a Braintree boy, and always
feeling the sentiments, which once on losing sight of the
blue hills in your neighborhood, I committed to paper in
the following lines :
And you, ye distant hills of blue —
To whom I bid, with bosom burning,
When wending far, my last Adieu ;
And first to greet mine eyes returning;
Oh ! how shall speech in words convey,
Words, the heart holds not in derision,
The pang that points your parting ray.
The bliss that wings your meeting vision.
Let me then in addressing you, fellow citizens of Brain-
tree, say I ivas or rather I am a native of the town of
Braintree, and let that be your motive for indulging me
with the freedom of speech — with more boldness than I
might presume to use, if I came among you as a stranger.
And I make this appeal to your kind and indulgent
feelings because I shall need it. David Hume took it as a
warrant of authority to speak his sentiments boldly,
because at the age of 65 he claimed to be a man of a
former age ; restrained by none of those prudential consid-
erations which admonish a speaker in addressing the public
to abstain from exciting topics, and to say nothing with
which the prepossessions of his hearers might not cordially
sympathise — Yet he had not then attained, and never
reached the allotted boundary of old age to man — the
three score years and ten of his earthly pilgrimage ; which
I have already passed. I have then a stronger claim than
his upon the mere score of age to speak my sentiments

boldly, and that which is thus my right, becomes my im-
perious and overrnling duty, towards you the inhabitants
of my native town, of which through all the wanderings
of a long and eventful life, I have never ceased in the
sincerity of my soul to say,
"" Where'er I roam, whatever realms I see,
My heart untravell'd fondly turns to thee.""
When I undertook the arduous, but not unwelcome task
of addressing you in public, it was intimated to me that it
might be agreeable to yon to hear me upon that most in-
teresting subject to you and to your posterity, the educa-
tion of your children ; and the desire of discoursing to you
upon the theme, not less than in the manner the most
acceptable to yourselves, was of strong prevailment to in-
duce a ready compliance with that intimation.
But what could I possibly say to you for the advance-
ment of the cause of education which you do not habit-
ually say to yourselves ? — We are almost daily celebrating
in every part of New England, the accomplishment of two
centuries since the first gathering of a church or the
incorporation of a town. A few weeks only have past
away since the filial reverence of the descendants from the
first founders of the church and religious society at Mount
Wollaston, paid this tribute of commemoration to the
virtues of their forefathers — and within the compass of
another year it is your purpose to strew flowers over the
sepulchres of those patriarchs of our land by a similar
festival to keep in remembrance the founders of our prim-
itive town of Braintree. We have embalmed anew the
venerable remains of our first Pastor and Teacher William
Thomson and Henry Flint ; but there is an incident con-
nected with the history of the latter, not less precious
than any other memorial in his individual life. On his
grave stone, yet standing in the cemetery of the church in
Q,uincy, of which he was a principal founder, is yet legible

8
the following record — "" Here lies interred the body of the
Rev. Mr. Henry Flint, who came to New England in the
year 1635, was ordained the first teacher of the church of
Braintray 1639, and died April 27, 1668. He had the
character of a gentleman, remarkable for his piety, learning,
wisdom and fidelity in his ofiice."" Men and women of
Braintree ! had the monumental inscription upon the tomb
of the beloved instructor and spiritual monitor, counseller
and guide, of your forefather pilgrims of the first cis-
atlantic generation terminated here, might I not have
invited you to pause and meditate — ^to inquire how much
of the peace, how much of the earthly happiness, how
much of the piety and virtue, how much of the eternal
welfare of your ancestors of five generations, of yourselves,
of your children and your children's children to the end
of time, may be directly and indirectly traced to those
qualities thus testified as characteristics of this venerable
man ? — But the blessed memorial stops not here, it proceeds
— "" By him on his right hand lies the body of Margery,
his beloved consort who died March 1686-7. Her maid-
en name was Hoar. She was a gentlewoman of piety,
prudence, and peculiarly accomplished for instructing young
gentlewomen, many being sent to her from other towns,
especially from Boston."" Women of Braintree, let me
now appeal to you ! If I was authorised to inquire how
highly is to be estimated by your townsmen of the present
generation, the blessing of being descended from fathers
who were fed with the nourishment of the bread of life
by a shepherd of souls so distinguished as the first teacher
of the Braintree Church, how much more emphatically
may I ask the same question of you, who in addition to
the enjoyment of the same benefits, may look back to
the matrons of the town from its first foundation, as blest
with the means of education suited to the tenderness, the
refinement and delicacy of their sex. The solicitude of
the first fathers of New England for the education of

9
their sons has been among their brightest claims to renown
in all succeeding ages. And shall it not be among the
garlands of glory to the women of Braintree, that in the
roll of their primitive mothers, the wife of their first
pastor was not only eminent as an instructress of wisdom
and virtue, but that her services to the age and land in
which she lived, were so worthily appreciated by her
surviving cotemporary inhabitants of the town, that their
grateful acknowledgment and remembrance of them yet
lives and breathes and speaks to us all, from the assembled
multitude of the surrounding dead, and from the voice of
her husband's tomb.
— It is an opinion universally entertained that the first
and great impulse to the settlement of New England was
Religion. But has it been sufficiently considered, and
may I be permitted to inquire, whether Religion is not
herself the child of Education, and whether it would not
be more proper to say, that Education was from its first
origin the governing principle of the settlement of New
England, or in other words that Education was the mother
of New England ?
What is Religion 1 Is it not the sentiment in the heart
of man, of his own immortal nature, and of his responsi-
bility to a tribunal not of earth for his conduct upon earth.
The existence of a God ; the immortality of the human
soul, and future retribution, are the elements of what is
called Natural Religion — but even these first principles are
not of spontaneous growth in the human heart. They
are the fruits of Education — they must be taught. They
were revealed by God himself to the first created man,
and to his' partner in the Garden of Eden, and they are
still taught to Christians of all denominations in the Mo-
saic narrative of the Creation.
But this is not the Religion which prompted the settle-
ment of New England — for this is a creed common to
the Christian, Mohammedan and Jew throughout the habi-
2

10
table globe. The first settlers of New England were
Christians of the most straitest sect. Their text-book
was the Bible ; a book written by various authors — in
different periods of the world — the latest, sixteen hundred
years remote, at the time of the settlement of New Eng-
land, and all, in languages no longer extant save in the
memory of the profoundly learned.
In this book were contained the history of the human
race from the creation of the world ; a rule of faith, for the
relations between man and his Maker ; a rule of life, for
the government of his relations with his fellow creature
man — and the glorious gospel of the blessed God. But
in the wise and inscrutable dispensations of Providence,
this book of divine inspiration for its composition, had
been committed to the uninspired intellect of man for its
construction. What the meaning was of any one state-
ment of fact, principle, sentiment or opinion contained in
it, was to be ascertained by the ordinary operations of the
human mind. It was mind impressed upon paper, in the
characters of the alphabet. But the first five books of
this compilation, the Pentateuch, or five books of Moses,
had been written very recently after the first invention of
alphabetical writing, and contained in that mode of
incorporating thought two thousand years of history
before the existence of that invention ; when the narra-
tive of events, and the lessons of morals, and the precepts
of instruction must necessarily have been delivered from
mind to mind, by some other mode of conveyance. It is
well known that before the invention of alphabetical
writing, the Egyptian records were kept in what was
called hieroglyphics, or an art of expressing thought by
imagery. Writing was the picture of thought. Material
substances were thus represented by their portraiture, a
man, a horse, a bird, a fish. The sun, moon and stars,
mountains, trees and rivers, every object in nature visible
to the eye, could be represented to the eye, by imitation.

11
In the progress of human improvement certain properties
were observed invariably to belong to certain material sub-
stances, and by common agreement the material substance
was exhibited for the property belonging to it. Hence the
extension of the art of hieroglyphic writing, and I submit
to your consideration a conjecture which has often occurred
to me, that the account of the creation in the book of Gen-
esis, was only a transfer to alphabetic writing, of more an-
cient Egyptian memorials in hieroglyphics. For we are
expressly told that Moses was learned in all the wisdom of
the Egyptians, and this may account for the representa-
tion of the Spirit of evil in the form of a Serpent, and for
that of life, and for the knowledge of good and evil,
abstractions of the mind, in the shape of trees growing in
the garden of Paradise.
Be this however as it may, the books of Moses are
written in the Hebrew language, a dialect of the Phoeni-
cian ; as it was spoken by the children of Israel at the
time of their emigration from Egypt about fifteen hundred
years before the birth of Christ. The subsequent histori-
cal books, from Joshua, the immediate successor of Moses,
to Ezra and Nehemiah, contain the history of more than
one thousand years, in the same language, modified from
age to age, through the long lapse of years, and by the
intermixture of the children of Israel with the various
nations of Palestine, and with the Assyrians, Babylonians,
Modes and Persians, by whom they were successively
subdued and carried into captivity. The Psalms of David,
as they are called, but really of him and of several other
writers ranging through a period of a thousand years, the
Proverbs, the Canticles, and the Ecclesiastes of Solomon,
and the solemn and awful revelations from Heaven com-
mitted to writing by seventeen prophets, are in the same
language, with an intermixture of the Chaldaic in the
books composed after the Babylonian captivity. All the
Books of tlie New Testament, as originally composed, are

12
in the Greek language, and there are translations of all the
Books of the Old Testament into the Greek and Latin
languages, of so great antiquity, that by the vast majority
of the Christian world they are considered in all respects
of equal, and in some passages of superior authority to the
Hebrew.
These books, thus composed, are universally admitted,
by all Christians of all denominations, as containing a rule
of faith and a rule of life for all human kind. But, con-
sidered merely as history, they relate a series of events
almost entirely miraculous, that is of special interpositions
of divine Providence, suspending the ordinary laws of
physical nature, and operating by preternatural agency.
Considered as prophecies, their predictions are darkly and
mysteriously blended with their history — and there is
among Christians great diversity of opinion, with regard
to the import and meaning of the prophecies — diversities
which have given rise to bitter controversies, to furious
dissensions, and to cruel, bloody and exterminating wars.
The Founder of the Christian religion himself, promised
as a Redeemer of mankind from the transgression of their
first parents in paradise — promised by a covenant of Al-
mighty God with Abraham the father of the faithful, in
the clear, explicit and repeated declaration that in his seed
all the families of the earth should be blessed — promised
again to his son Isaac, and to his son Jacob — promised
through a long succession of ages, to Moses, to Daniel, to
Solomon, to a long line of prophets and of kings — the Foun-
der of the Christian religion himself, was crucified as a
malefactor — numbered with the transgressors of that very
law which he came to fulfil and to abolish. He suffered
the ignominious death of the Cross, by the sentence of the
law, delivered from Sinai, as understood and expounded
by the high priest instituted by that divine dispensation.
But this crucified Galilean, was the Saviour of the
world — the Redeemer promised at the expulsion of

13
Adam from Paradise. In a career of four years of man-
hood immediately preceding his death, he had unfolded
to the world of mankind a new i^ule of life — a com-
plete system of morals, founded upon two first principles ;
two elementary ideas. The one, was life and immor-
tality, or in other words, the resurrection. The other,
was the law of brotherly love, founded upon the principle
of the natural equality of mankind and the resulting prin-
ciple of peace on earth, good will to men, and the duty
of universal application of doing unto others as you would
that they should do unto you. In these two elementary
principles, all Christians of all denominations concur.
Whoever derides or disbelieves them or either of them can
have no claims to the title of a Christian. It was not
indeed for the promulgation of either of these doctrines
that he suffered death. It was for the assertion of his
own authority as the promised Messiah, for the declaration
that he was the Son of God — that he possessed and ex-
ercised the power of performing miracles, and of forgiving
sins ; and for the unqualified assertion, that if they should
put him to death he would by his own resurrection and
ascension within three days, prove the truth of his doc-
trine of immortal life. He was accordingly sentenced to
death, and the sentence was executed in strict conformity
to the Law of Moses as it was understood by the Priests,
the Scribes and Pharisees, the Ministers and Interpreters
of the Law, And as he had foretold, on the third day
from his crucifixion he rose again from the dead, was
seen and conversed with by hundreds of his disciples for
the space of forty days ; and then leaving them with the
explicit declaration that all power was given unto him in
heaven and in earth, and with the express command
therefore^ to go and teach all nations, baptizing them in
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Ghost — teaching them, to observe all things whatsoever
he had comrnanded the disciples, and with the promise

14
that he would be with them always, even unto the end of
the world.
Christian brethren and sisters ! when I undertook to
discourse to you upon the subject of Education — upon
the first superficial survey of my subject, under a sort of
prepossession, that considerations connected with your
temporal and worldly welfare would be the only motives
proper to be presented by a layman to your minds, I
naturally inquired of myself, as at the entrance of this
address I have inquired of you, what I could possibly say
to you for the promotion of the cause of education, which
you do not daily and habitually say to yourselves ? But
when, desirous of presenting in front the arguments which
could operate at once upon your hearts and minds, I
turned my thoughts to the principles and impulses which
had influenced and directed your venerable ancestors, the
first settlers of New England, the first and overruling mo-
tive, which stood forth in prominent relief as the corner-stone
of their History was Religion — the Christian Religion —
And as this was not simply the Religion of Nature, but
peculiarly the Religion of a Book, the first reference to
that Book, its history and character, immediately disclosed
the source of that deep and intense interest, that fervid
and unceasing anxiety, which glowed in the bosoms of all
the first founders of New England. The Religion of the
Bible must be taught. It must be instilled into the mind
of childhood, and believed even before it is understood.
Worldly motives and interests, have been the exclusive or
the predominating influences to the settlement of all other
colonial establishments known to the history of mankind.
The only exception of ancient history was the emigration
of Abraham from Ur of Chaldea, and the subsequent
exodus of his descendants, the children of Israel, from
Egypt to settle in the promised land. They carried with
them a Code of Laws delivered by God himself to Moses
upon Mount Sinai, which they accepted by an express

15
and formal covenant, often repeated by their posterity, and
binding upon them through all the vicissitudes of their
fortunes, till the promised Mediator of the New Covenant
appeared in the person of Jesus of Nazareth. He came
among them, declaring himself as having existed before
Abraham, as commissioned expressly by his Father and
their Father, by his God and their God, to deliver to them
a New Law, to fulfil and partially to supersede the Law
delivered from Sinai. He came claiming to be their
prophet, priest and king — but he declared that his king-
dom was not of this world — It was the kingdom of
Heaven — It was the resurrection from death to immortal
life, — and his new Law — his new command — first to his
own people, the children of Israel, and then to the whole
race of man in that and all succeeding ages — was the Law
of Love, That they should love one another.
This simple and all-pervading principle was not in the
Law of Moses. It was not in any preexisting code of
Laws ever imposed upon men. It was buried in the heart
of man, blended and surrounded with every selfish and
sordid passion to which his fall from Paradise had sur-
rendered him. But it was there, and Jesus who knew
what was in man brought it forth, and proclaimed it as
the transcendent and paramount Law of man's nature.
At the same time he told his disciples, that as a test of his
principles he must himself sutler a cruel and ignominious
death — a death reserved for malefactors and slaves. He
told them, that they must all expect for proclaiming the
glad tidings of his gospel to share his fate and suffer like
him — That their own hearts were so incrusted with evil
passions, and perverse customs and traditions, that they
themselves did not fully comprehend the extent and
universality of his Law — That to conform their practice
to it, they must be regenerated, must be born again, and
become entirely new men — That they themselves knew
not what spirit they were of, and that devoted to him

16
and his doctrines as they declared and believed themselves
to be, they would all desert and deny him at his last
hour — as they did.
But he gave in his own person the proof of his doctrine
of resurrection from the dead — and after that event, he
promised them the Holy Ghost, as a Comforter for all
they had suffered, and all they had yet to endure, and
commanded them to go forth and teach all nations to ob-
serve whatsoever things he had commanded them.
Now this teaching of the commandments of Christ, to
be observed by all nations, was by the express terms of
the commission, recorded in the Gospel of St. Matthew, to
continue to the end of the world — and wherever the
Christian religion is established, this teaching must be to
child/'e7i, and it must continue through life. For it is not
only doctrine but observance that must be taught — Faith
and Works.
The doctrine of immortal life, is so congenial to the
heart even of unregenerate man ; it is so soothing even to
his selfish passions, that it is easily believed by all to
whom it is taught. Though not explicitly revealed in
the Old Testament, it was believed, not as an article of
faith, but as a speculative opinion by the generality of the
Jewish nation ; excepting by the sect of the Sadducees,
who denied it altogether. A clear, undoubting conviction
of it, is the first article of the Christian faith, and it is
accordingly taught by Christians of every denomination.
A future state of retribution, a resurrection of bliss to all
who have done good, and of condemnation to all who
have done evil, is also a fundamental article of Christianity,
although the particular nature of the happiness to be en-
joyed, and the nature and extent of the condemnation to
be endured, have not been explicitly revealed.
But the doctrine of eternal life, is not the only lesson to
be taught by the disciples of Jesus to all nations, to the
end of the world — ^it is to be taught in connection indis-

17
soluble with the new commandment, to love one another.
Among his last words at the table of the passover imme-
diately before his death, he gave this neio commandment
— and repeating it expressly said, "" by this shall all men
know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to
another.""
This precept, too, was understood by all his apostles, as
embracing the whole substance of his commands — nor has
it ever been questioned by any human being, recognizing
his authority as a divine teacher of religion and morals.
And with these two principles universally received by
all who call upon the name of Christ, and acknowledge
him as their Lord and Master, how is it comprehensible,
that this religion of awful responsibility to God for the
observance of universal benevolence to man, should have
been for more than sixteen hundred years, from the day
of Christ's passion till the settlement of New England,
the source and cause from age to age of the bloodiest and
most desolating wars that ever afflicted the human race.
By what unaccountable perversity in the composition of
the animal man, the only animated being on the face of
the terraqueous globe, endowed by his Creator with the
faculty of reason, is it, that the religion of Conscience and
of Love, of glory to God in the highest, and of peace on
earth, good will to men, should in the process of its
operations on the heart and mind of man towards that
consummation of its destiny, promised and intended by its
Founder, when the practice of Christians shall correspond
with the Christian faith, and all the kingdoms of the
earth shall become the kingdoms of the Lord Jesus Christ,
have been doomed to make its way through oceans of
blood — through ages of persecution, through hatred
and revenge, through bigotry and superstition, through
avarice and ambition, through fraud and hypocrisy,
through lust and pride, through fanaticism and delu-
sion, through all that the Spirit of evil cau devise and all

18
that fallen man, .the compound of the tiger and the fox
can perpetrate, to that serene empyrean of Heaven upon
earth, when the Lion shall lie down with the Lamb,
when the swords shall be beaten into ploughshares and
the spears into pruning hooks — when nation shall no
longer rise against nation, neither shall they learn war
any more ?
Christian Friends ! — The radical cause of this deplor-
able inconsistency, and of all this melancholy depravity
in the History of Mankind is defective Educaiion. That
the human heart is deceitful above all things, and despe-
rately wicked, had been said by divine inspiration, hun-
dreds of years before the birth of the Redeemer, nor until
his appearance upon earth had there been any improve-
ment in its condition. Jesus was a teacher sent from God,
to reveal the doctrine of immortal life and future retribu-
tion, and to teach the way on earth to eternal blessedness
in Heaven.
But when the teacher has done his part, there remains
to be performed the part of the learner. It was never
promised by Jesus or his Apostles that the system of faith
and of morals which he taught, should be forthwith re-
ceived, understood and practised upon by all mankind. In
confirmation of his doctrine of immortality, and to authen-
ticate his mission from heaven, he performed miracles, or
as he called them, mighty works. In illustration of the
practice which he commanded his disciples to observe
and to teach, he spoke in parables for the space of four
years, disclosing even in minute detail the practical appli-
cation of his new commandment of mutual love, to all the
ordinary concerns of human life. But he came to teach,
and not to compel. His Law was a Law of Liberty. He
left the human mind and human action free, and the first
lesson that he gave to his disciples was that he came to
revolutionize the very nature of man — to regenerate him
from the womb — to extirpate from his bosom all the evil

19
passions to which he had been surrendered by the disobe-
dience of his first parents to the commandment of God,
and to purify unto himself a pecuhar people, zealous of
good works. Bat he gave them no encouragement to
hope that this revolution in the very nature of man would
be immediately or even speedily accomplished. He fore-
warned them that he must himself suffer death in confir-
mation of his mission by the treachery of one of them-
selves. He announced and bewailed the impending ruin
and destruction of Chorazin, of Bethsaida, of Jerusalem
herself, for the hardness of the hearts of their people, who
despised his authority, and rejected his commands. He
told them plainly that they should have persecution in
the world in proportion to their fidelity to him, and that
he came not to bring Peace upon earth but a sword.
A sword say you ? for what ? for what but for self-
defence ? He brought it not for conquest — for tyranny
or oppression — but he brought it to be used by his dis-
ciples for their own defence, in their conflicts with the
world against the tyranny and oppression of others. He
was himself put to death, as he had foretold he should be,
and upon his trial, rebuked one of his earliest disciples,
for using the sword that he had brought, not in self-
defence, but in useless and furious animosity against a
servant of the high priest.
In the execution of the command which he gave them
after his resurrection and immediately before his ascen-
sion, to go forth and teach all nations till the end of the
world to observe all the commands which he had delivered
to them — they went forth and taught. For the space of
more than three hundred years, they met in return for
this teaching, persecution, martyrdom, and cruel death.
Still they taught — and still according to that beautiful
parable of their Lord and Master, of the sower and the
seed — although much of their seed fell by the way side
and was devoured by the fowls of the air, much upon

20
stony places, where it could take no root, but sprang up
and under a scorching sun, soon withered away ; much
among thorns, which sprang up and choked them — yet
other fell upon good ground, and brought forth fruit,
some an hundred fold, some sixty fold, some thirty fold.
And thus, under ten successive merciless decrees of so
many Roman Emperors, masters of the world, prohibiting
upon pain of death, this teaching of the disciples of Jesus,
it was still making its way into the heart of man, irresis-
tibly superseding the institutions of the Levitical Law,
undermining and overthrowing the idolatrous worship of
the Roman Empire, and prostrating before the simple
command of mutual love from the lips of the Teacher of
Nazareth, all the thrones and dominions, principalities and
powers of the Earth.
At length after more than three hundred years of pro-
scription and persecution, the religion of Jesus ascended
the imperial throne of the Ccesars, and was proclaimed
mistress of the world. But alas ! the seed which until
then had fallen by the way side and been devoured by
the fowls of the air, was now destined to fall upon stony
places, to spring up without root, and to wither away
under the scorching sun of imperial power. Constantine
adopted and professed and ordained the Christian religion,
not in its own spirit of obedience to God and love to man,
but as an instrument of conquest — as a weapon of war.
He had seen or pretended to have seen a vision of a
crucifix, at noon-day, transcending the light of the sun,
and bearing the legible inscription in the Greek language
— ""By this, conquer."" It was in the midst of a formidable
war that this supernatural apparition presented itself to his
eyes, which a cotemporary Christian historian, Eusebius,
bishop of CaBsarea, declares was related by Constantine
to himself many years after, confirmed by the solemnity
of an oath. But whether this vision was the result of a
fanatical delusion imposing upon the optical nerves of

21
Constantine himself, or whether it was a fraudulent and
deliberate imposture, it carried with it internal evidence,
that the establishment of Christianity upon the throne of
the world, was not in the true spirit of the Redeemer,
life, immortality and brotherly love, but war, hatred and
conquest. Constantine therefore stripped from all the
warlike standards of the empire the bird of prey, the
Roman Eagle ; and supplied his place with the Labarum,
the conquering and unconquerable emblem of the cross —
and thenceforth the banners of the cross themselves
became the banners of fraud and imposture, and the
standard of a crucified Saviour, was waved over em-
battled legions marching to conquest, instead of peaceful
disciples teaching all nations the law of immortal life
and of brotherly love.
And upon this vicious foundation was soon erected a
system of ecclesiastical hierarchy, in the progress of which
the bishops of Rome, assuming to be the successors of
Saint Peter, with the pastoral staff of a shepherd and the
ring of a fisherman, arrogated to themselves a dominion
over their brethren of the Christian faith, to which no
sovereign of earthly origin ever presumed to aspire. From
teachers of the gospel of Christ they were gradually
metamorphosed by the ascendancy which they acquired
over the minds of men, not only into sovereign temporal
princes, but into superior beings, exempt from all the
infirmities of human nature, invested with absolute and
uncontrollable power, armed with the authority of setting
up and putting down kings, of absolving subjects from
the ties of allegiance to their sovereigns, of laying whole
nations under interdict, and of distributing at their dis-
cretion all the territories of the earth ; and to cap the
climax of blasphemy, not only to forgive and redeem
from punishment the transgressions of men, but to grant
for money indulgences for the perpetration of crimes.
Can it be conceived as possible that this abominable

22
system of fraud and imposture was actually consummated,
originating in the adoption of Christianity by Constantine,
commencing by small and imperceptible beginnings, but
swelling and expanding into portentous immensity, for the
space of nearly twelve hundred years, till the appointed
day of Martin Luther.
And during the same period, some of the seeds fell
among thorns, which grew up with them and choked
them — thorns of internal dissension and thorns of external
war. Rival ambition had manifested itself among the
twelve apostles of Jesus, even while he lived ; nor was it
wholly extinguished by his severe admonition that they
knew not what spirit they were of. Immediately after
his decease, irritating debates and sharp animosities sprung
up among them — multitudes of the Jewish converts main-
taining that the whole Levitical law continued unre-
pealed, and the proselytes from the gentiles inflexibly
refusing to submit to the rite of circumcision, or to restrict
themselves to the distinction between clean and unclean
meats, or to encumber themselves with the burthensome
ritual of the Mosaic law. In the Instructions of Jesus
to his disciples, he had dwelt with emphatic solemnity
upon the indispensable necessity of Faith in him and his
doctrines, for admission to the kingdom of Heaven and
for salvation to their immortal souls — but the law which
he gave was a law of universal love, and no stronger
evidence of Faith in him could be exhibited than by
implicit observance of that Law. Now Faith, in the
sense in which it was required by Jesus of his disciples,
has been defined by the Apostle of the Gentiles ""the
substance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things
not seen."" It is belief — a property of man's immortal
soul, possessed by no other being upon earth. For belief
gives to future time the anticipated certainty of the
past — it annihilates time and space, and is the most
powerful of all the arguments of natural religion to prove

23
the immortal nature of man. Well then might Jesus and
his Apostles, in their teaching of mankind, dwell upon the
transcendent importance and irresistible efficacy of this
passive faith, this firm belief in the divine mission of
the Saviour and in the promises of his gospel, for there is
another property of faiih^ by which it regulates the con-
duct of men. This is active faith, and is the foundation
of all the moral relations between man and his fellow-
creature man. This faith in action, is the adamantine
chain which holds the moral elements of the world
together. Faith in its passive sense may be considered
as synonymous with confidence — in its active sense with
fidelity. The definition of faith by St. Paul in the 11th
chapter of the Epistle to the Hebrews, is of passive
faith — and he says elsewhere that it comes by hearing
— and hearing by the word of God. But all the illus-
trations throughout the whole of that chapter of the
unbounded power of faith, consist of its efiicacy to the
production of works ; as confidence in God ; as passive
faith — belief in the omnipotence and goodness of God.
You have all observed, my friends, in reading and
comparing together the strong language of St. Paul in
urging this all comprehensive power and influence of
faith, with that of his brother Apostle James in the
second chapter of his Epistle, where he seems to represent
faith as altogether subordinate to works ; there is an
apparent difierence between the two Apostles, as to the
sense in which they understand the term Faith. The
difference is only apparent. The definition of St. Paul
is strictly confined to faith in its passive sense, as synony-
mous with belief — confidence in God — but all his illus-
trations, both special from Abel to Samuel and the prophets,
and general, of the sufi'erings endured and of wonders per-
formed by the faithful, are all, without a single exception,
instances of faith manifested by works. So that St.
James, who so emphatically declares that faith without

24
works is dead, and that the devils believe and tremble,
manifestly refers only to that faith which is synonymous
with belief, while St, Paul as manifestly refers to that
faith which is synonymous with fidelity — the faith
which is manifested in action, by the performance of
good works. There is therefore no real difference be-
tween the doctrines of the two Apostles ; but need I tell
you that there was a difference, a deep and radical dif-
ference of impression upon the minds of the disciples who
heard them, with regard to this doctrine of faith and
works, which after a lapse of nearly nineteen hundred
years yet remains unadjusted, and which even now may
expose me to the suspicion of heresy for this simple state-
ment of my own views of the case. I pray you to under-
stand that I am not about to involve myself or you in the
controversy between Faith and Works — that I only
speak historically ; only point out to you some of the
thorns of internal dissension among which the seed of
the blessed gospel fell immediately after it had been sown,
and in the first century of the Christian era. And then
came the trials of the Apostles ; the repeated imprison-
ments of Peter ; the martyrdom of Stephen by a frantic
multitude, and of James by the tyrant Herod ; the cruel
persecutions first inflicted and afterwards endured by
Paul ; the charges against the Christians of setting fire
to Rome by Nero, and the long train of ten Persecutions
from that time till the conversion of Constantino — while
at the same time from the teeming fancies of the converts
to Christianity multitudes of wild"", extravagant and absurd
sectarian creeds sprung up in the rank soil of the human
heart, to obscure the divine light of the gospel and to choke
the seed of the sower. The time will allow me barely to
glance at the melancholy fertility of the successive growths
of thorns which choked the seeds of the truth as it is in
Jesus, for many centuries by the imposture of Mahomet
founded upon the principle of inextinguishable War, in

25
direct opposition to that of perpetual and universal Peace,
the pure and simple doctrine of Christianity — or by that
perversion of Cln-istian principle generated by the false
religion of the Koran, the Crusades for the recovery of
the Sepulchre of Christ from the infidels, and the short
lived establishment of a Christian kingdom in what was
termed the holy land.
Of all these obstructions to the establishment of the
peacetul kingdom of Christ upon earth, the most terrible
and the most fatal, was the dominion which the bishops
of Rome, in the name and as the pretended successors of
Saint Peter, had usurped over the minds of men. Instead
of teaching all nations the observance of the commands
of Christ, the bishops of Rome had in a long succession
of ages erected a Sovereignty for ruling all nations, and
teaching them only the commands of men — and they
ruled with a rod of iron. We all know that the reforma-
tion of this anti-Christian system was commenced by
Martin Luther, and that although for ages before, in-
eifectual struggles against it had been crushed by its
power, it was the monstrous pretension and practice of
selling indulgences for the commission of crimes, which
was first contested and then assailed by him as a teacher
of nations to the observance of the commands of Christ,
according to the commission given by the Saviour to his
disciples at the moment preceding his ascension.
Of the progress of the Protestant Reformation it is
impossible for me here to speak ; but in discoursing to you
upon the importance and the transcendent duties of edu-
cation, I pray you to remark that the direct issue between
the Protestant reformers and the papal usurpations was
educatioti. It was the freedom of thought against or-
ganized power. It had been established as one of the
fundamental articles of the Catholic faith, that the Roman
Pontiff — the head of the Church — was infallible — that
his will was law. That the keys of Heaven had been
4

26
transmitted to him in uninterrupted succession from Saint
Peter, and that aU other powers upon earth, were bound
to imphcit obedience to his decrees, issued with a fraudulent
semblance of humility in the professed capacity of a
servant of servants. To secure this implicit obedience
to his will, the word of God itself, the Scriptures of the
Old and New Testament, were withheld from the in-
spection of the People, and reserved to the exclusive
possession of the Priesthood — for many ages not only
the great mass of the People, but the Rulers of the earth,
kings and emperors, were not even taught to read, and
when in the revolutions of time, the languages in which
the Oracles of God had been composed became extinct,
no translation of them into any of the languages of modern
Europe had been published, until Luther with his own
hand, in defiance of the papal law, made the first trans-
lation of them into German,
Thus one of the first consequences of the Protestant
Reformation was to unlock the Holy Scriptures to the
understandings of the people — but that they might be
qualified to receive them, it became indispensably neces-
sary to teach the great mass of the people the art of read-
ing. It was also necessary that this art should be taught
in childhood ; not only because childhood is the period of
human life best adapted to the reception of all religious
impressions, but because the tenderness of affection for
children had been signally manifested throughout his life
by the Founder of Christianity, and because one of his
most peremptory and affecting commands to his disciples
had been, "" Suffer little children to come unto me, and
forbid them not.""
Education, then, the education of children, and the art
of reading, was the primary impulse to the Protestant
Reformation. The right of reading the Bible, was the
first privilege secured to every follower of Christ, by the
successful assault of Martin Luther upon the supremacy
of the Church of Rome.

27
But the Reformation was the work of ages — it is not
yet consummated. The Bible is the word of God, the
seed of righteousness upon earth, and of blessedness in
the world to come. But of this seed, much still falls by
the way side, much on stony places, much among thorns ;
and even of that which falls upon good ground, the returns
are unequal, according to the richness of the soil and the
variety of the seasons. Luther translated the Scriptures
into the German language, and made them thus accessible
to all his countrymen who could read. He was followed
by a host of pious and learned men, of the other European
nations, who translated the holy writings into the several
languages of their respective countries, and thus the study
of the Scriptures became the universal occupation of all
the Christian nations. The invention of printing, which
had preceded only by a few years the daring innovations
of Luther, multiplied as the sands of the sea, the readers
of the canonized books, and the splendid Polyglott Bible,
compiled with immense labor, and published with princely
magnificence by Cardinal Ximenes, furnished the learned
patriarchs of the Reformation the means of correcting and
improving their versions of the Old and New Testaments
in the modern languages, by collating and comparing with
each other not only the text of the Scriptures themselves,
but the commentaries upon them and expositions of their
contents, as well by the Doctors of the Jewish Sanhedrim,
as by the Fathers of the Christian Church.
The seals of divine revelation were thus broken, and
the Bible was opened to the inspection and examination
of the Protestant Christian throughout the world. But
two steps further became indispensably necessary to the
full enjoyment of the inestimable treasure thus dispensed
to all classes of the community. The first was education
— by dispensing to the whole people, the knowledge of
the art of reading — and the second Avas the right of private
judgment, or in other words the privilege of every reader,

28
to exercise the faculties of his own understanding in the
interpretation of what he reads.
And here we find the source of that inseparable connec-
tion between knowledge, and virtue and liberty, which
characterized your forefathers, the Puritan settlers of New
England, beyond every other people upon earth. Other
Colonies have been settled under the impulse of worldly
interests — of commercial enterprise — of romantic adventure
for the search of gold or silver mines, or from the baser
motive of ambition varnished over with zeal — the conquest
of unoffending nations under the hypocritical pretence of
converting them to the Christian faith.
The transcendent and overruling principle of the first
settlers of New England, was Conscience. All the mon-
archies of Christendom resisted the reformation of Luther.
A war of thirty years was the immediate consequence of
his secession from the Church of Rome, in his native land
— a war, the ravages and desolation of which still arrest
the traveller over those regions in his path, with the melan-
choly reflection that the ruin inflicted by the hand of man,
as it surpasses the destructive power, bids defiance even to
the repairing hand of time. The wars of the Reformation
extended over all Europe. They were modified by the
political agitations and convulsions of the age. The spirit
of reform was arrested in its progress by the apostacy of
Henry the 4th in France — it severed from the crown of
Spain the Provinces of the United Netherlands, and con-
verted them into a Republic. It overthrew the dynasty
of the Stuarts in Great Britain ; brought one of its monarchs
to the block ; and expelled another and his family for-
ever from the throne. In the process of these convulsions
a portion of the people of England, withdrew from the
field of persecution and of blood ; not from any motives
of worldly welfare, but to the total sacrifice of them all,
for the uninterrupted enjoyment of the rights of conscience ;
for the privilege of holding the Holy Scriptures as their

29
only rule of faith, and of interpreting them by the dictates
of their own understanding.
Now to a colony thus composed, the education of their
children was a necessary of life more indispensable than
food, or raiment, or shelter. Their bodies might perish
by famine, or by nakedness, or by exposure to the inclem-
ency of winter snows and barren rocks, in a region where
it has recently been said that granite and ice are the only
productions of nature — but animal life, the preservation of
their bodies, was to them but a secondary concern. The
food for which they hungered and thirsted was for the
nourishment of the spirit, and the preservation of the
never dying soul. This was the Faith that came by
hearing. The first of all their wants was teachers —
teachers for themselves — teachers for their children.
Was I not then justified in saying that Education was
the mother of New England ? — that the predominating
and controlling impulse which brought our forefathers
from a land where they were in the enjoyment of every
temporal blessing, and which they tenderly loved, as their
country, to a howling wilderness where they could enjoy
nothing but Conscience and Freedom, was Education 7
Such is the testimony of their History — what is the lan-
guage of their Laws ?
With the first settlers of the Massachusetts Colony,
there came over learned and pious men, educated at the
English Universities, and some of them among the most
eminent divines of the age. On board the Arabella, the
vessel in which Governor Winthrop came, religious
worship was regularly performed, every Lord's day, even
in the most tempestuous weather ; and immediately after
their departure from the coast of England, they appointed
two days in the week, upon which Mr. Phillips, their
minister, catechised the people.
On their arrival in this land, their first care was to keep
a day of thanksgiving in all their plantations, and no

30
sooner had they fixed upon the three hills as the spot for
their settlement, than they formed themselves into a
church, and chose Mr. Wilson their Teacher, Mr. Newell
an Elder, and Mr. Gager and Mr. Aspenwall, Deacons.
Nor is it to be forgotten that in our own town of Braintree,
the gathering of the church preceded the incorporation of
the town — that the primary cause of the formation of the
church, was the inconvenience and sometimes impossibility
for the inhabitants of Mount Wollaston to attend public
worship at Boston, and that small as their numbers were,
they chose two persons for the administration of their
spiritual concerns, one under the denomination of Pastor,
and the other of Teacher.
Within six years after their landing in the wilderness,
four hundred pounds were given by the General Court of
the Massachusetts Colony towards the establishment of
-a public school at Newtown, afterwards called Cambridge ;
.and two years later, a teadter of the word of God, John
Harvard, self-expatriated from England, as if by an ex-
press dispensation of divine Providence, came, for one
short year to break the bread of life to the Church at
Charlestown, and then to depart for the world of spirits,
leaving his whole fortune for the foundation of a College
-which will bear his name in reverence and honor on the
wings of Time to the end of the world.
In the same year in which that illustrious body sent forth
the first fruits of New England education to the world,
the General Court enacted a law declaring, that "" For as
much as the good education of children is of singular
behoof and benefit to any commonwealth — that the
.selectmen of every town, in the several precincts and
quarters where they dwell, shall have a vigilant eye over
their brethren and neighbors to see, first, that none of
them shall sufler so much barbarism in any of their
families as not to endeavor to teach, by themselves or
kOthers, their children and apprentices, so much learning,

31
as may enable them perfectly to read the English tongue,
and knowledge of the capital laws.""
Also that all masters of families do once a week (at the
least) catechise their children and servants in ilte grounds
and principles of religion.
There are other provisions in this law, all adapted to
the purpose of carrying it into full execution.
Four years later (in 1646) in the enactment of a code
of criminal law, it was provided, that if any child or
children, above sixteen years old, and of sufficient under-
standing, shall curse or smite their Jiatural father or
mother, he or they shall be put to death, unless it can be
sufficiently testified that the parents have been very
unchristianly negligent in the education of such children
— and a law in the same words was some years afterwards
enacted in the Plymouth Colony.
And in May, 1647, in addition to all these preceding en-
actments for the teaching of religion by the organization
of Churches, and for the instruction of children in their
families, a general law was passed, requiring of every
township within the jurisdiction, consisting of fifty house-
holders, to appoint forthwith, a teacher of all such chil-
dren who should resort to him, to write and read, to be
paid either by the parents or masters of such children or
by the inhabitants of the town. And further, that every
town consisting of one hundred families or householders-
should set up a grammar school, the master thereof being
able to instruct youth so far as they may be fitted for the
university.
And listen to the beautiful — may I not say sublime
preamble to this law, declaring the motive and purpose
of its enactment.
"" It being one chief project of Satan to keep man from
the knowledge of the Scripture, as in former times keep-
ing them in unknown tongues, so in these latter times by
persuading from the use of tongues, that so at least the

32
true sense and meaning of the original might be clouded
and corrupted with false glosses of deceivers ; to the end
that learning may not be buried in the graves of our fore-
fathers, in Church and Commonwealth, the Lord assisting
our endeavors. It is therefore ordered by this court and
authority thereof,"" &c.
Here then, in the Laws enacted by the first settlers of
New England, is a complete system of instruction, based
upon the principle that human life, from the cradle to the
grave, is a school — That at every period of his existence,
man wants a teacher, and that his pilgrimage upon earth
is but a term of childhood, in which he is to be educated
for the manhood of a brighter world. Let the scoffer at
the demure spirit and austere manners of the Puritans,
survey the history of mankind — let him ransack the
annals of every gathering of man into society from the
confusion of Babel to the settlement of Sierra Leone, New
South Wales or Liberia, and find a parallel to this primi-
tive code of New England Colonial Law !
This system continued in full force until, in the progress
and vicissitudes of the reformation in the parent coun-
try, the charter of the Colony was annulled by the despi-
cable tyrant Charles the Second. Immediately after the
revolution of 1688, a new Charter was obtained from
William and Mary, including the Colonies of Massachu-
setts and Plymouth as well as the District of Maine and
Nova Scotia. By the vacation of the Charter, all the
preceding Colonial Laws were understood to have been
superseded with it, and as the jurisdiction of the New
Province extended over several preceding Colonies, which
had been governed by different laws, an entire new
system of Legislation became necessary. Hence, among
the laws of the very first sessions of the General Court
mider the new Charter, was an Act for the Settlement
and Support of Ministers and Schoolmasters.
This Statute preserved and fortified the system of

33
education which sixty years before had been established
by the founders of the Colony — the system of universal
education, providing at once for the support of the Pastor
and the Schoolmaster, the teacher of adult age and the
teacher of children, by the common contributions of all.
In proportion as the population, and the worldly wealth of
the Province increased, this system was expanded and
enlarged by subsidiary legislation, till the revolution
which severed the North American Colonies from the
British Empire, At that time, when the People of the
Commonwealth were called upon in their sovereign
capacity to form a Constitution of Government for them-
selves, they declared by a special Article in their Declara-
tion of Rights, that as the happiness of a people, and the
good order and preservation of civil government, essentially
depend upon piety, religion and morality ; and as these can-
not be generally diffused through a community, but by the
institution of the public worship of God, and of public
instructions in piety, religion and morality, therefore the
Legislature were authorized to require the several towns,
parishes, precincts and other bodies politic or religious
societies, to make suitable provision, at their own expense,
for the institution of the public worship of God, and for
the support and maintenance of public Protestant teachers
of piety, religion and morality, in all cases where such pro-
vision shall not be made voluntarily.
Such was the opinion and such the ordinance of your
fathers in the days of their severest trials, and when their
afflictions taught them to place all their reliance upon
their Creator. The people of Massachusetts in their days
of prosperity and enjoyment have seen fit to repeal this
Article of their Bill of Rights, and to leave the support of
religion and morality, and of their teachers to the volun-
tary contributions of the People alone. Fondly would I
hope that this constitutional alteration has proceeded from
no growing indifference to the cause of piety, religion and
5

34
morality, but from a firm conviction that they will be as
liberally and effectively supported by voluntary contribu-
tion, as they ever have been by legislative enactment.
The Constitution of the Commonwealth had also a
special Chapter, for the preservation, protection, and pro-
motion of all the rights, privileges and immunities of
Harvard University ; and the general encouragement of
Literature — making it the special duty of Legislatures and
Magistrates in all future periods of the Commonwealth, to
cherish the interests of literature and the sciences, and all
seminaries of them : especially the University at Cam-
bridge, public schools, and grammar schools in the towns.
From these provisions in the Constitution of the State,
we have ample evidence, that at no period of our history
has the interest of the People in behalf of education been
more ardent and intense than it was at the time when in
the midst of a most calamitous and terrible civil war, they
were first summoned to exercise the rights and to wield
the powers of an Independent People.
I have already detained you too long to protract the
call upon your attention, by entering upon a detail of the
legislation of the Commonwealth on the subject of edu-
cation since that time. It is no pleasant recollection to
bring to your minds, and it is yet a duty with which I
cannot dispense, to remark that the very first act of legis-
lation under the government of the Commonwealth, for
the instruction of youth, and for the promotion of good
education, presents a painful relaxation if not an inex-
cusable dereliction of the spirit which until then had
animated all our forefathers. The act of 1693, merely
repeating the provisions of that of 1647, required that
every town having the number of fifty householders, or
upwards, should be consianily provided of a schoolmaster
to teach children to read and write, and that in every
town of one hundred families, there should be kept a
grammar school, by a person well instructed in the

35
tongues. In the act of 1789, the duty requh-ed of towns
of fifty householders is only to have schoolmasters to
teach reading and writing, for such term of time as shall
be equivalent to six months for one school in each year.
Towns of one hundred families only, were required to
keep a teacher of reading and writing the year round ; and
only towns of two hundred families to keep a grammar
school.
You will observe that by this alteration of the law,
one-half the time of all the children of the Common-
wealth, of teachable age for learning to read and write,
was taken away, and the same principle as might easily
be shown pervaded the whole law, diminishing the facili-
ties for acquiring education, provided by the law, at least
by one-half. What were the motives for this change I
presume not now to inquire ; but I cannot otherwise than
consider it as evidence of an unhappy decline of that
fervid spirit, for the education of children, which was so
signally characteristic of the Pilgrim fathers of the Colony
— of the native fathers of the Province — and of the
founders of the Constitutional Commonwealth, The
general spirit of your laws relative to education, since
that time, has been to multiply the objects of study upon
your children, and to diminish the time which you allow
them for making the acquisition of learning. This evil
has not yet been removed. You may be startled at
hearing that since the act of 1789, you yourselves have
enjoyed facilities of learning at most half equal to those
which your forefathers enjoyed from the first settlement
of the Colony — and that your children now enjoy no
more than you have possessed yourselves. I speak not now
of private schools and academies endowed by the benefi-
cence of individuals, or accessible to the children of
opulence ; but of schools provided by law, and accessible
to the children of all. In very recent years, the People
of the Commonwealth have kindled with a fresh ardor

^

36
in the cause of education, and their Legislature have
shared largely of their noble enthusiasm. The annual
returns of schools, from all the towns of the Common-
wealth ; the institution of a liberal and enlightened Board
of Education ; the annual reports and indefatigable labors
of their able and eloquent Secretary ; and the provision
made, by an affecting union of individual munificence
with public bounty, for normal schools, to elevate the
standard of instruction by the education of accomplished
teachers — all these are pledges of delightful promise for
the improvement of the rising and future generations.
But my friends and brethren of my native town, to
return to the radical thought upon which I invited you
to consider this subject, and which you may perhaps
think more appropriate to the religious exercises of the
Lord's day, and to the hallowed lips of your reverend
pastor, than to the amusement of a weekday, and the
discourse of a man of the world, let me close as I began
with intreating you to bear in mind that the invincible
spirit which brought your Puritan fathers to New Eng-
land, was Education. Let us impress it indelibly on our
own minds ; let us impress it to the extent of our ability
upon others, that Education is the business of human life
— that our religion is the religion of a book — and that the
meaning of that book is intrusted by divine Providence
to the deliberate judgment of our own understandings.
That as the child must be educated for manhood upon
earth, so the man must be educated upon earth, for
heaven ; and finally that where the foundation is not laid
in Time, the superstructure cannot rise for Eternity."

199,169900762,Kunwari,Sponge Cola,[20],['Alternative'],"Tayo na namang dalawa
Walang sali-salita, pinagtagpo ng tadhana
Magkasamang nag-iisa
Sa bawat sulyap lang ba tayo puedeng magkita?
Naghihintay may mauna sa ating dalawang madulas...
Oh oh oh...
Lagi-lagi namang walang pakialam
Oh, ako ba sa iyo'y walang pag-asa?
Puso ay laging nasasaktan
Hanggang kunwari na lang ba ako aasa?
Hanggang kunwari...
Hanggang kunwari...
Bilang ko ang bawat hakbang
Mula ating pagpunta patungong dulong sakayan
Maglilihis nang ating landas
Bukas kaya, muli kang masisilayan?
Oh, sana ay 'di lang anino ko'ng nakita
Hanggang sa muli...
Lagi-lagi namang walang pakialam
Oh, ako ba sa iyo'y walang pag-asa?
Puso ay laging nasasaktan
Hanggang kunwari na lang ba ako aasa?
Hanggang kunwari...
Hanggang kunwari...
Naghihintay may mauna sa ating dalawang madulas...
Oh oh...
Lagi-lagi namang walang pakialam
Oh, ako ba sa iyo'y walang pag-asa?
Puso ay laging nasasaktan
Hanggang kunwari na lang ba ako aasa?
Hanggang kunwari...
Hanggang kunwari..."
