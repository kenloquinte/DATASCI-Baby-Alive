Tinatanong ko sa sarili ko kung kailan kaya
Ako makakaramdam ng saya na tulad nila
Yung balintuna pag nakita ko ang kanyang mata
Yung kada magkasama kami parang pulot-gata
Kailan kaya ako?
Kailan kaya ako?
Kailan kaya ako?
Kailan kaya ako sasaya?

Hanggang pangarap na lang ba talaga? (oh yeah)
Yung mga bagay na gustong mangyari laging wala (no, no)
Yung may kasama na kumain at gumala-gala (yes sir)
Yung babaeng magpaparamdam na ako'y sapat na (ha)
Sanay naman ako na mag-isa (yuh)
Pero mas okay kung kasama ka (hm, haha)
Kasi alam ko na nandiyan ka lang (oh)
Hindi na kita hahanapin, 'lam kong darating ka (no, no, no, no)
Gusto ko kasing tagal ng ""Probinsyano"" (yeah)
Yung relasyon natin na lumalaban parang si Cardo
Tatalunin natin lahat kahit gaano katayog
Basta pangako hanggang sa huli nandiyan pa rin tayo
Tinatanong ko sa sarili ko kung kailan kaya
Ako makakaramdam ng saya na tulad nila
Yung balintuna pag nakita ko ang kanyang mata
Yung kada magkasama kami parang pulot-gata
Kailan kaya ako?
Kailan kaya ako?
Kailan kaya ako?
Kailan kaya ako sasaya?

Gabi-gabi napapaisip, ""kailan kaya?"" (ooh)
Magmamahal sa 'kin ng tunay, sino kaya? (ooh)
Am I not pretty, babe, am I not enough?
Can you please tell me baby, am I not good for you?
Wag naman masyadong sweet (yeah, yeah)
Pag magkatabi sa jeep (ooh)
Wag mo naman saktan ang puso ko kahit saglit (no, no)
Kailan kaya darating, sinta? (ooh)
Gusto ko nang makita ka (yeah)
Hihintayin, sisikapin
Kasi gusto ko nang makapiling ka
Sabay tayo kumain
Magkasama na gumala
'Di na ko mag-iisa kasi ngayon magkasama na tayo (yeah, yeah, yeah)
Kasama na kita, yeah
Pero kailan kaya?
Tinatanong ko sa sarili ko kung kailan kaya
Ako makakaramdam ng saya na tulad nila
Yung balintuna pag nakita ko ang kanyang mata
Yung kada magkasama kami parang pulot-gata
Kailan kaya ako?
Kailan kaya ako?
Kailan kaya ako?
Kailan kaya ako sasaya?

Matthaios: Hello
KIARA: Hello
Matthaios:Nasaan ka na?
KIARA: Nandito lang
Matthaios: So kailan na tayo?

Nasaan ka na ba?
Nandito na ako
Pumunta ka na dito at ibibigay sa 'yo
Wag magalala
'Di ako tulad nila
Kahit mag-away tayo ay sa 'yo pa rin ako
Tinatanong ko sa sarili ko kung kailan kaya (kailan kaya)
Ako makakaramdam ng saya na tulad nila
Yung balintuna pag nakita ko ang kanyang mata
Yung kada magkasama kami parang pulot-gata
Kailan kaya ako? (kailan kaya ako?)
Kailan kaya ako? (kailan kaya ako?)

4,177235378,Kahit Na,ALLMO$T feat. Roberto Bello,[18],['Hip Hop/Rap'],"Ayan na naman
Nakasimangot, tampo’y ‘di maiwasan
Pero kahit na, kahit na
Ilang ulit kang suyui’y ayos lang
At sinanay mong ganyan
Ang hirap mo na namang kausapin
Ayaw mong malapitan
Kanina pa ko nagsasalita
Ano bang gusto mong palabasin
Mas lalo mong sinusungitan
Kasi ako ayokong lumala
Parang ako na lang ang nag-aalala
Sa tuwing dumadating sa pagkakataon
Na para bang wala ng dahilan
Na ituloy pa tong tinawag mong pagmamahal
P***** ina nakakatanga na ‘di ko maramdaman kung pa’no pa
Natin malabasan kung nasanay ka ng ganyan
‘Di na ko masasabik pang muli sayong halik
Kung halaga ko ay ‘di mo na rin kayang maibalik
Ilang ulit na rin akong napagod, hindi ako sumuko
Sumugod pa rin kahit alam kong malulunod
Lang din naman ako sayong pag-ibig lang na ubod
Ng pait sa susunod ‘di na papayag mapaikot pang muli
Kung ayaw mo na ‘wag mo na sana pang patagalin
‘Di naman ako magtataka kung balak mo na rin namang gawin
Kung ayaw mo na ‘wag mo na sana pang patagalin dahil
Nasanay ka kasing ikaw na lang lagi ang tama
Nalimutan mo na kung pa’no ba ang magpakababa
Ayan na naman
Nakasimangot, tampo’y ‘di maiwasan
Pero kahit na, kahit na
Ilang ulit kang suyui’y ayos lang
At sinanay mong ganyan
Kahit ilang beses pa
Mag-away ‘di pa rin madadala
Sa galit mo ako’y nasanay na
‘Di pa rin makabitaw kahit nagsawa na
Eh kasi
‘Di mo na kailangan pang ipilit ako lang nahihirapan
Bakit nga ba ganito ang nararanasan
Kung kayang-kaya pa naman nating pag-usapan
Bakit ka nga ba nagkaganyan?
‘Di katulad noong nakaraan
Bawat trip ko sa iyo palagi mo na lang sinasakyan
Kaya kahit na
Kahit, kahit na
Kung gusto mo sumuko pwede mo na sya gawin ngayon hanggat maaga pa
Kung ayaw mo na
Kung ayaw mo na
Di kita pinipilit mapanatili pa
Manatili pa
Ayan na naman
Nakasimangot, tampo’y ‘di maiwasan
Pero kahit na, kahit na
Ilang ulit kang suyui’y ayos lang
At sinanay mong ganyan
Masaya naman na tayo
Wala na ‘kong hihilingin
‘Di ko man naisip lumayo sa tagal nating
Magkasama ni minsan hindi nabaling ang tingin
Gusto yung palaging sinusuyo ka sa bawat pagtatalo
Para lang tayo ay ‘di na ginawin
Habang tumatagal ay tila parang may nagbago
‘Di ko na kilala ang babaeng nasa salamin
Hindi na kita kilala
Sana ‘wag mo nang hayaan pa na lumala
Hindi porket kinukunsinti ka sa bawat
Pagkakamali ay hindi na binibigyan ng halaga
Ang masama pa yata dito ay naging ako
Masyadong hinayaan ang isang katulad mo
Na gawin ang lahat ng gusto hanggang
Hindi mo na makita kung ano ang halaga
At kung ano ako sa buhay mo
Bakit kailangan pa na mabalewala?
Ano ba ang nagawa kong masama?
Naging maayos naman ang pakikisama
Walang ibang hinangad para ganto ang magawa
Sabihin mo kung ‘di mo na ko kailangan
Para nga hindi ka na nahihirapan
Kusa na kong lalayo para pagdating sa huli
Ay ‘di ko na muli ito na pagsisihan
Ayan na naman
Nakasimangot, tampo’y ‘di maiwasan
Pero kahit na, kahit na
Ilang ulit kang suyui’y ayos lang
At sinanay mong ganyan
Ang gusto ko lang naman
Ay ang makita kang nakangiti
Pero bakit laging simangot ang iyong binabawi
Sa tuwing nilalambing ka
Kala ko ba ako ang nagmamay-ari
Ng puso mo pero bakit parang hindi
Nakakawalang gana
Parang ayoko ng umasa
Na matagal pa kitang makakasama kasi
Hindi naman magkakaganito kung hindi mo ako pinahirapan
Kaya mas pipiliin ko na lang din siguro na talikuran
Ang ipinangako natin sa isa’t isa
Kasi parang lahat din naman ay iyong binalewala
Kaya ‘wag kang magtataka
Kung wala na ko sa tabi mo sa susunod na magalit ka
Ayan na naman
Nakasimangot, tampo’y ‘di maiwasan
Pero kahit na, kahit na
Ilang ulit kang suyui’y ayos lang
Ayan na naman
Nakasimangot, tampo’y ‘di maiwasan
Pero kahit na, kahit na
Ilang ulit kang suyui’y ayos lang

Bakit ka ba naniniwala sa kanya?
Di ko alam, ganun lang talaga

Bakit? Bakit pumapayag ako?
Halina sa lugar na kung saan
Masaya ang lahat ng mga kawatan
At kahit di totoo ang kanyang sinasabi
Lagi siyang pinakikinggan
Walang pakialam sa salitang ilan
Kahit gaano kamahal ang pinagbilhan
At kahit na dinoktor ang lahat ng detalye
Lagi siyang napagbibigyan

Ba't di mo subukang buksan ang iyong mga mata?
Kung ayaw nilang tumalon, ba't di ka mauna?
Sige, subukan mo lang na walang kakaba-kaba
Kung ito ang simula ng wikas
Isa-isa mong burahin ang mga bakas
Bago pa matuyo ang lahat ng katas
At tuluyang mabaliko ang lahat ng batas sa Pinas (sa Pinas)
Ano ang iyong pananaw sa lahat ng mga nangyayari sa Mindanao?
Kapit lang, kapatid, 'wag kang bibitaw

Lasing sa kasalukuyan ngunit malaman ang ala-ala
Gising at kasulukuyang malala na
Nadala na sa nakaraang magdamag na baon sa pagtulog
Bukas ang bakas ay may babaon sa limot
Eto ang mga kwento ng makata
Basahin ang mga nasa gitna ng talata
Siksik na parang delata, seksi pang dalaga
Sorry di na ako binata
Ang mga kwento ng makata
Inumpisahan sa tulang pinamagatang Balak
Isinulat na walang alak
Laman lamang ng utak ang pinadaloy sa panulat
Laman ng puso ang pangmulat na walang panggulat
Simple lang, kabado, easy lang
Kung busy, ngisi lang
Kalmado, steady lang
Ngayon ang panahon ng pagbubuhat ng sariling bangko, keri lang
Di mo kailangan mag Ingles para malaman nilang matalino ka
Di rin naman kailangan managalog para malaman nilang Pilipino ka
Pilipino ka, kalabaw ka hindi ka baka
Hindi ka mansanas kundi mangga
At wag mo nang asahan datnan ang panahong tatangos ang iyong ilong
Tsong hindi ka puti, kayumanggi ang kulay mo
Mahalaga kung ano ang kaya mong gawin
Gawing magaling, tinitibok ng bawat damdamin ang gawang magaling
Sumigaw kung kailangan na mailabas ang nagbabagang galit sa dibdib
Ngunit sunog na ang daigdig sa mga sinasabing walang silbi
Kaya nakasalpak sa mga manhid ang panawid gutom, kumakalam ang tenga
Nakasalampak sa sahig ang mga patay-gutom, said walang kumakalinga
May mga pantas na di malaman ang tungo
Hindi puso kundi nguso ang panturo
Naging sinungaling ang mga labi ng mga bagong saling-lahi
Di pa huli ang lahat, hawiin ang ulam nakakabulag
Kini mao ang akong balak at ang balak namin ni Gloc

'Di ko naman inakala na ganyan ka
Kasi nung unang kita ko sa 'yo ay anghel ka
Pero nung tumagal ako'y nahulog na
Ika'y bigla ng umalis, ako'y nawasak na
Nung umaga na 'yon ay sobrang okay tayo
Pero bakit nung gabi ay bigla ka nagbago

Matapos makuha ang 'yong hinahanap bigla mo na lang akong kakalimutan (hey)

Bakit di nalang sayo

Bumitaw ng tuluyang manawa

Iniwan na kita di na tayo nagtagal pero kayang tiisin
Kahit di maintindihan di ko na pag-isipan na
Ikaw ay palitan at hindi ko nagawa na ikaw ay pag-isipan

Ngunit sa isang iglap nagmimistulang tigre
Hindi ko rin naiintindihan isa lang ang alam ko ito'y
Papanindigan ka'y dalas pagtawanan kapag tinatalakan
Pasalamat ka hindi ko kayang ikaw ay saktan
Nakakasira ka ng ulo oo nakakabaliw Pagtatalo natin ang naging libangan mo't aliw
Kailangan ka pang suyuin kahit ikaw ang mali
Nagkakasundo man tayo sobra na yung sandali
Minsan gusto kong isipin na wala ng paraan
Kapag gusto mong magalit wala kang pakialam
Ayos lang handa naman akong pagtiisan lahat yan ay
Napapawi ng isang ngiti mo lang

Si GF iiwanan ka din nyan, si dota Hindi
Si GF nagagalit kapag nagdodota ka, si dota hindi nagagalit kapag nag GF ka
Si Dota 20 pesos lang masaya na, si GF baka 200 pesos baka di pa masaya
Pagnakakita ka ng ibang hero, di nagagalit si dota
Pero pag nakakita ka ng ibang babae, nagagalit si GF
Si GF kapag iniwan mo mahirap kang balikan, si Dota kapag iniwan mohanda ka pa ring tanggapin
Ano mas gusto mo? Dota o GF?
Chorus:
Anong pipiliin mo dota o ako
Anong mas gusto mo pagkasama kay yun ang nasa isip
Anong pipiliin mo dota o ako
At ano ako sayo anong mahalaga mahal mo ba akong talaga
Defense of the Ancient tayo ng magdota umulan o bumagyo
Kahit naka bota tawagin na ang tropa
Lets start the count down everybody push get ready for gangbang
Pumatak na ang dugo within 3 minutes ang bilis makabuo
Parang basketball lang make me like mike
Sa dami kong kills ako’y naging god like
Yo! line stand paki push yan
Pagkatapos nyan tayo ng mag Roshan
Nice strategy para bang menisky
And skills are type para bang si Aikee
The sword the for the last hour
Panalo ang kuhain basagin na natin
Ang puno ng mulawin
Good game maybe next time sir imba sorry chiken na sir
Chorus:
Anong pipiliin mo dota o ako
Anong mas gusto mo pagkasama kay yun ang nasa isip
Anong pipiliin mo dota o ako
At ano ako sayo anong mahalaga mahal mo ba akong talaga
Kapag naglalaro anong ligaya ang nadarama
Nalilimutan ang problema at pag nadarapa
Di ako nagdadrama tingnan ang pagkakaiba
Kapag sinaktan ka ng girlfriend puso ay nagigiba
Kapag meron kang pera kapag meron kang tf
Ang dota 20 pesos the rest mapupunta kay GF
Di ka kayang mahalin ng dota kailanman
Yan ay nagbibigay libang kahit sa sinuman
Ano bang nakita mo sa dota na wala ako
Kaya ka bang mahalin ng dotang sinasabi mo
Ang dota ay laro na pwede mong paglaruan
Wag mong itulad sa akin na nasasaktan
Ano bang nakita mo sa dota na wala ako
Kaya ka bang mahalin ng dotang sinasabi mo
Ang dota ay laro na pwede mong paglaruan
Wag mong itulad sa akin na nasasaktan
Chorus:
Anong pipiliin mo dota o ako
Anong mas gusto mo pagkasama kay yun ang nasa isip
Anong mas gusto dota o ako
At ano ako sayo anong mahalaga mahal mo ba akong talaga
Chorus:
Anong pipiliin mo dota o ako
Anong mas gusto mo pagkasama kay yun ang nasa isip
Anong mas gusto dota o ako
At ano ako sayo anong mahalaga mahal mo ba akong talaga
Ang dota ay isang larong imbento
Ito ay libanga ng mga tao
Ngunit mag-aral muna ng mabuti para sa kinabukasan mo
Upang sa hinaharap maipagmalaki mo"

Sige bilisan mo pa ha hanggang sa madapa kasi ang kupad kupad mo
Takbo para di ka maabutan, kinikilabutan, kinatatakutan mo
Kapag nahuli ka patay kang bata ka na para bang nakunan sa sinapupunan uh
Isa dalawa tatlo kilala bilang mga sira ulo
Halatang inakala ng iba
Na di makapangyarihan ang mga ginayuma
Wasak ang mga talukap ng mga masangsang na alamang at talangkang walang alam at halatang nagtatakang naghahatakan ng pababa ng pababa lang hanggan sa hangganan ng walang hanggan
Puro mga inggitero na bagot, oo mga feelingerong nayamot
Pano niyo ko hihilahin sa balong malilim e hindi niyo nga ko maabot
Bratatatatatara chik chik bang! o di ba nakakatakot?
Pagkat di nyo matatakasan ang boses ng kabataan
Kapag sure hit na ang mga pasabog
Sino ba yan? sinubaybayan at sinabayan nanaman ng buong sambayanan
Kahit gago,makabago, makatao at makatarungan eto na si abra tantananan
Di man katangkaran pero nakayanang umakyat sa pedistal at gumawa ng himala
Binatang makatang matinik na kakaiba talaga mag-isip miski maliit
Ang dami paring mga tumitingala braaaa!

Sige pumasok ka sa loob ng aking utak
Pwede mo itong ihalintulad sa isang higanting pintuang di mo maitulak
Tignan mo itsura, di mo masikmura parang ginawa mo inumin ang suka
Wag kang umasa na mangyari magka-chansa ka sakin, kasi distansya natin
Bituwin at lupa
Libu-libong sinagupa binaon parang basura pinipicturan ko muna
Bago ilibing sa lupa primitimong lirisismo pipilitin kong pihitin
Kung tingin mong kiliti mong imposible kong makuha pilipinong sining
At literaturang hinaluan ng mga bara na parang hiroglipiko masulat
Mga titik na inipon at sinukat ay nagiging ipo-ipo pag hindi ko naisuka
Pag ako nagalit, papaupuin kita sa dala ko na karet
Ako si kamatayan bumaba mula sa langit
Alam mo ba kung bakit? para sindihan ka nang buhay
Hanggang sa malapnos ang balat at makalbo ang anit
Pag parang kambing na yung amoy papatayin ko yung apoy palakol ang gamit
Sige pumasok ka pa sa loob ng aking utak
Hinulma ng usok, puyat, Kuya Kiko at ni 2pac
Susubukan kong unatin at sukatin sa talampakan
Upang makita nila lampas bente ang taas
Maaring makapasok kaso nga lang pag pintua'y nagsarado siguradong
Di na pwedeng lumabas
Sige pumasok ka sa loob ng aking utak
Para kang umakyat ng banahaw at naligaw sa gitna ng gubat
Di mo maintindihan parang dikit dikit na sulat ng doktor
Mga kabit-kabit na letrang parang tren pinanakbo pa rin
Kahit akala ng iba'y kinakalawang ang motor
Hawak ko'y tinidor na mula kay Poseidon at Shiva
Pag tinamaan nang lintek siguradong may baong matataas na along
Kayang lumamon ng isla
Salamat ginising mo ang pinakamatangkad sa limang daliri ko
Uso ata ang utak at uso pa bato panahong paleolitiko
Masdan mo ang sugat sa likod ng larawang ng mga multong di na nagparamdam
Dati'y binabahayan ng pula ngayon nama'y binabawi na ng mga itim na langgam
Naramdaman ang nagbabagang lupa mula sa bala ng shaman
Nagpatangay sa hangin hanggang sa mapadpad sa patag
Na dapat lakaran pag daan ko mga aso kumahol
Yung iba ay naglabas ng pala, piko, asarol
Sinubukan nilang hukayin ang lalim ngunit natagpuan lang nila ay ang kanilang
Sariling ataol
Tanggalin niyo na muna ang mga muta sa mata na nakabara hala sige maghilamos
Nang makita niyo na mga patay na isda lang ang sumasabay sa agos"

Sa tuwing kasama kita
Aminin mo na tayong dalawa ay bagay talaga
Bagay tayo
Bagay tayo - bagay tayo
Bagay tayo
Bagay tayong dalawa
Hawakan mo ang aking kamay at lilipad na nang sabay
Alam mong sa tuwing ika'y aking nasisilayan
Agad ng mawawala ang pagod ko
Palaging hinahanap ang tamis ng yong ngiti
Sa tuwing ako ay binabalot na ng takot ko
Ikaw ang dahilan kung bakit na patuloy na
Ginagawa ang mga bagay kahit na magkamali
Tanging sayo lamang to maniniwala kahit na
Madami dyan na kung ano ano ang pinagsasabi
Susulitin mga oras na ikaw ang kausap
Kung makasama ka ay para bang nasa ulap
Hindi na nanaisin pang muling makahanap
Ng iba kasi ikaw ang sumagot sa pangarap
Di na mapagantay sa iyong pagdating
Basata't tatandaan mo lang kahit saan makarating
Merong nag sisilbing panata ang ikaw lang at ako
Pangako na kahit ano mangyare hindi lalayo
Di na ako mag dadalawang isip kung gusto kita
Kitang kita ko rin ang saya sa yong mga mata
Sa tuwing kasama mo ko
Sa tuwing kasama kita
Aminin mo na tayong dalawa ay bagay talaga
Bagay tayo
Bagay tayo - bagay tayo
Bagay tayo
Bagay tayong dalawa
Hawakan mo ang aking kamay at lilipad na nang sabay
Alam mo ba kapag andito ka
Bumibilis tibok ng puso at
Bakit ikaw ang laging nasa isip ko
Pagmulat ng mga mata
Ikaw ang hanap ko
Sa gabi ikaw ang nasa panaginip ko
Alam kong paulit ulit na lahat ng sinasabe ko kasi
Di ko mapaliwanag ang aking nadarama
Sana nga ay makasama na kita
Upang makita mo kung paano ako magpahalaga at magpakita na
Ikaw ako at walang iba ay bagay talaga
Kahit na ano mangyari basta't
Tayong dalawa ang magkasama
Yun lang ang mahalaga
Di na ako mag dadalawang isip kung gusto kita
Kitang kita ko rin ang saya sa yong mga mata
Sa tuwing kasama mo ko
Sa tuwing kasama kita
Aminin mo na tayong dalawa ay bagay talaga
Bagay tayo
Bagay tayo - bagay tayo

Absolute bedlam. 300 drunken STOCKBROKERS, most in their early 20s, chant wildly as JORDAN BELFORT, handsome, 30, stands beside a DWARF dressed in tights, cape & helmet.
JORDAN
Twenty five grand to the first cocksucker to nail a bullseye!
The “bullseye” is a large dollar sign in the middle of a giant velcro “dartboard”.

JORDAN (CONT’D) Watch and learn, people!
The Brokers go apeshit as Jordan grabs the Dwarf by his pants and collar. In the Crowd, cash flies as side bets are made. Jordan winds up, aims for the “dartboard”.
JORDAN (CONT’D) One. Two. Throw!!
The Brokers cheer, and as the screaming Dwarf takes flight, hurtling toward camera, we FREEZE FRAME:

JORDAN (V.O.) --which really pissed me off because it was three shy of a million a week.
The Ferrari weaves in and out of traffic.
JORDAN (V.O.) Hey, my Ferrari was white, like Don Johnson’s in Miami Vice.

The helicopter rises sharply, then levels out, hovering 30 feet above a huge mansion. Down below, through Jordan’s hazy, DOUBLE VISIONED POV, we see a sparkling pool, tennis court and waterfall.
JORDAN (V.O.) Check this out -- despite my completely fucked-up state, I could fly straight while still seeing two of everything.

Gadgets, computers, oxblood leather furniture. With the DIN of the brokerage firm bleeding in, Jordan uses a credit card to cut a line of coke on his desk. As he peels a crisp $100 DOLLAR BILL off a wad, rolls it up:
JORDAN
Enough of this shit’ll make you invincible, able to conquer the world and eviscerate your enemies.
He SNARFS up the line, gestures to the cocaine.
JORDAN (CONT’D) I’m not talking about this. I’m talking about this.

Money is the oxygen of capitalism and I wanna breathe more than any other human being alive.

Computers, telephones everywhere. At their desks, 45 shirt-sleeved BROKERS read their Wall St. Journals, readying for war. Like an eager puppy, Jordan follows broker JERRY FOGEL, 30, thick-lipped and bow-tied...
JERRY FOGEL You got a problem with that?
(reads name tag) Jordan?
JORDAN Nope. No problem at all.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	7.

JERRY FOGEL Your job is ‘connector’, which
means you'll be dialing the phone over 500 times a day, trying to ‘connect’ me with business owners. And till you pass your Series 7, that’s all you’ll be doing. Sit.
Jordan takes a seat at the desk next to Fogel’s.
JERRY FOGEL (CONT’D) Just so you know, last year I made over 300k and the other guy you'll be working for made a million.
JORDAN (V.O.)
A million dollars? I could only imagine what a douchebag that guy must be.
A manicured hand lands on Jordan’s shoulder. It’s MARK HANNA, 30s, charismatic, movie-star handsome.
MARK HANNA Jordan? Mark Hanna.
(re: Fogel)
Good, you’ve met Jerry. One of the smartest guys in the office. Who’s ever sucked a dog’s cock out of loneliness.
Fogel’s smile turns to a frown. He hands Jordan a stack of 3x5 index cards.
JERRY FOGEL Smile and dial. And don’t pick your fucking head up till one.
MARK HANNA
Don’t mind Jerry, his father raped him as a child. Besides, I'm senior broker here, he's a worthless piker. I heard you pitched stock at your job interview.
JORDAN
Had to do something to stand out.
MARK HANNA
I fuckin’ love that! Let’s grab lunch later. Windows good with you?
JORDAN Great. Yeah.

Hanna gives him a wink, looks at the clock on the giant electronic stock ticker encircling the room -- 9:30 a.m.
MARK HANNA Let’s fuck!!
RING!!! Absolute pandemonium at the BELL signalling the opening of the stock market. Feet fly off desks; Brokers and their Connectors dial phones like mad. The CAMERA PUSHES IN on JORDAN, mesmerized as he takes in the ROAR.
BROKER #1 (to Broker #2)
Miniscribe's a fuckin’ steal! Thirty eight bucks a share!
MARK HANNA (into headset)
Your broker in West Virginia? What are you buying, a coal mine? It's the 80s, the game is high-tech.
BROKER #2 (to Broker #3)
Fuckface! I got 50,000 July 50s!
JORDAN (V.O.)
You want to know what money sounds like? Visit a trading floor on Wall Street. Fuck this, shit that. Cock, cunt, asshole. I couldn’t believe how these guys talked to each other--
Fogel notices Jordan sitting there frozen. He covers his mouthpiece, kicks the desk violently.
JERRY FOGEL Dial the cocksucking phone!
Jordan snaps out of it, starts dialing.
JORDAN (V.O.) I was hooked within seconds.
Mark Hanna slams down his phone in victory, scrawls out a “buy” ticket. He places the ticket into a glass cylinder which he slips into a plastic pneumatic tube.
JORDAN (V.O.)
It was like mainlining adrenaline.
The tube is WHOOSHED into the ceiling and we’re suddenly--

CLOSE ON a COKE SPOON whose contents disappear up a nostril. PULL BACK TO REVEAL...
The lunchtime power spot with panoramic views of the city. At a corner table, a paranoid Jordan looks around as Hanna does another bump of coke. None of the other DINERS seem to notice or care.
MARK HANNA (offering the spoon)
Got enough for one more? Tootski?
JORDAN No. Thanks though.
Hanna slips the vial into his pocket as HECTOR, the tuxedoed Maitre’D, approaches.
HECTOR
Mr. Hanna, what can I bring for you on this glorious afternoon?
Hanna surreptitiously palms Hector a $100; Jordan notices.
MARK HANNA Here’s the game plan, Hector. Bring us two Absolut Martinis
straight up. Precisely seven and a half minutes after you deliver those you’ll bring two more, then two more every five minutes until one of us passes out.
HECTOR
An excellent strategy, sir.
JORDAN Actually, I’m good with 7-Up.
Jordan might as well have farted at the table.
MARK HANNA
First day on Wall Street, Hector. Give him time.
(Hector offers menus) No thanks, I’m not eating.
Hector heads off.
JORDAN
You can get high during the day and still function?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	10.

MARK HANNA
High is the only way to do this fucking job. Guy who coined the term “three-martini lunch” was a woman. Cocaine and hookers, my friend, the keys to success.
Jordan smiles, not sure if Hanna is kidding.
JORDAN
I gotta say, I’m really excited about being part of your team. I wanna do all I can for our clients and --
MARK HANNA (reciting an ad)
“Here at L.F. Rothschild, our clients aren’t just important, they’re family.” Just as long as we get our taste first. Remember something, Jordan, your top priority in this job: make us money. If the clients get rich along the way, bully for them. Got a girlfriend?
JORDAN Wife. She cuts hair.
Mark swallows a comment about that. Gets to business.
MARK HANNA
OK, first rule of Wall Street. Nobody -- and I don’t care if you’re Warren Buffet or Jimmy Buffet -- nobody knows if a stock’s going up, down or fucking sideways, least of all stock brokers. But we have to pretend we know. Make sure you stay relaxed. Nobody wants to buy something from someone who sounds like they haven’t gotten laid in a month. Take breaks when you feel stressed, jerk off if you can. You like jerking off, right?
JORDAN Well... sure.
MARK HANNA
Good, jerking off is key. And I highly recommend cocaine, which will make you dial faster, which is good for me. Churn ‘em and burn ‘em, baby.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	11.

A BUSBOY stops by with a fresh napkin for Mark who thanks him. Then, discreetly as possible, Mark removes a fresh vial of cocaine tucked within and takes a quick snort. Jordan realizes: that’s why he palmed the maitre d’ $100.
JORDAN (V.O.)
For the next six months I learned the ways of Wall Street.

22	INT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT (OCT ‘87)	22
As STRIPPERS grind in b.g, Jordan parties with Mark Hanna and dozens of BROKERS and TRAINEES. Jordan sips a martini and studies Mark Hanna, hitting on a STRIPPER.
JORDAN (V.O.) That fall I passed my Series 7. Finally it was here.

23	INT. ROTHSCHILD BUILDING - LOBBY - DAY (OCT ‘87)	23
Briefcase in hand, Jordan boards the elevator with a dozen other BROKERS.

24	INT. L.F. ROTHSCHILD - BULLPEN - DAY (OCT ‘87)	24
Total chaos. Jordan dials the phone as all around him Brokers panic, screaming into headsets.
JORDAN (V.O.) They called it Black Monday.
By four p.m. the market was down 508 points, the biggest one-day drop since the crash of ‘29.
4 p.m. The closing bell RINGS; the entire place goes silent. Brokers look at each other, stunned.
MARK HANNA Holy. Fucking. Shit.
And as the Brokers start commiserating with each other...
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	12.

JORDAN (V.O.) L.F. Rothschild, a company that had been in business since 1883, closed its doors within a month.

25	INT. JORDAN & TERESA’S APARTMENT - KITCHEN - DAY (DEC ‘87)	25
Jordan sits at the table perusing the Times classifieds. Teresa approaches with two coffees. Sits next to him.
TERESA
So I’ll take an extra shift, don’t worry about it.
JORDAN
You work too much as it is.
TERESA
We could pawn my engagement ring.
JORDAN
We’re not pawning anything. I’m gonna be a millionaire, Teresa.
TERESA
You know that doesn’t matter, right?
He smiles, kisses her. Together, they peruse the ads.
JORDAN (points to an ad)
“Nobody Beats the Wiz”. I could be a stock boy.
TERESA You’re a stock broker.
JORDAN
No one’s hiring brokers right now, sweetie.
They go back to the ads. After a few beats, she points--
TERESA This place is.

In a suit, Jordan emerges from an ‘85 Datsun. He looks around confused, heads toward an unmarked storefront.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	13.

27	INT. INVESTOR’S CENTER - DAY (DEC ‘87)	27
The antithesis of L.F. Rothschild, with cheap furniture and a dozen misfit “BROKERS” giving loud, obnoxious sales pitches. Jordan enters, a modern man among cave people. DWAYNE, slovenly, 35, with a walrus mustache, looks up.
JORDAN
I’m looking for Investor’s Center?
DWAYNE That’s us, hey. Dwayne.
JORDAN
(as they shake hands) Jordan Belfort, I called earlier. I was a broker with Rothschild.
Dwayne motions Jordan to a seat. Nearby, a Broker in ratty Keds, TOBY WELCH, is screaming into his phone.
TOBY WELCH
I’m tellin’ you, this stock is goin’ up!... Cause I know, okay?!... I have inside information!
Jordan looks at him, appalled at what he’s hearing.
JORDAN Where are your quotrons?
DWAYNE
No quotrons, we sell off the pink sheets -- penny stocks.
Dwayne slides Jordan a large thin book; its pages are literally pink. He explains as Jordan flips the pages:
DWAYNE (CONT’D) Company don’t have enough capital to be listed on NASDAQ, their shares trade here.
(points to the book)
Like these guys, Aerotyne? They make radar detectors out of a garage in Dubuque.
JORDAN
Six cents a share? Who buys this crap?
DWAYNE Schmucks mostly. Mailmen,
plumbers, people thinking they can get rich quick. They answer our ads, Popular Mechanics, Hustler.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	14.

JORDAN
The spread on these is huge.
DWAYNE
So’s your commission, that’s the point. Blue chips stocks you get what, one percent? Pink sheets are fifty.
JORDAN
Wait a second. You’re telling me if I sell two thousand dollars worth of stock, my commission is a thousand bucks?
DWAYNE Technically, yeah, but not even the biggest schmuck buys two thousand dollars of this shit.

28	INT. INVESTOR’S CENTER - (LATER THAT) DAY (DEC ’87)	28
As others Brokers bark into phones, Jordan sits, phone cradled in his shoulder, making notes. A few beats, then:
JORDAN (into phone)
Mr. Fleming, good morning, Jordan Belfort with Investor’s Center in New York City. You recently responded to one of our ads...
A few of the other Brokers glance over, eavesdropping.
JORDAN (CONT’D) The reason I’m calling is that an extremely exciting investment
opportunity crossed my desk today. Typically our firm recommends no more than five stocks per year: this is one of them...
A few more Brokers look over...
JORDAN (CONT'D) Aerotyne International is a cutting edge tech firm out of the Midwest, awaiting imminent patent approval on a new generation of radar equipment...
LATER. Now all the Brokers listen in rapt attention.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	15.

JORDAN (CONT’D) -- so if Aerotyne’s shares rise to only a dollar -- and our
research indicates they could go much, much higher -- your profit on a mere three thousand dollar investment would be upwards of fifty thousand... That’s right, you could pay off your mortgage.
Seconds tick by; an eternity, then he starts writing:
JORDAN (CONT’D) Four thousand dollars, will that be check or money order?... Thank you, sir.
Jordan hangs up, scrawls out a “buy” ticket.
JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) Just like that I made two grand.
The other guys looked at me like I’d just discovered fire.
Toby Welch and the other cave-Brokers stare at him.
TOBY WELCH How’d you fuckin’ do that?

29	INT. INVESTOR’S CENTER - (ANOTHER) DAY (FEB ‘88)	29
Jordan sits at his desk in mid-pitch, totally focused.
JORDAN
It’s a rock-solid company, sir, it’s the next Microsoft...
Six thousand. Terrific.
As Jordan continues talking, wrapping up the sale...
JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) Though I knew I was selling
garbage, within twelve weeks I was making a fortune.
And as he starts scrawling out a buy ticket...
JORDAN (V.O.) And as a wise man once told me, my only responsibility was to put meat on the table.
CLOSE ON a 1988 Jaguar, parked outside a diner...

30	INT. KACANDES DINER - BAYSIDE - DAY (JUN ‘88)	30
Wearing a suit, Jordan sits in a booth reading the Wall Street Journal as a WAITRESS serves the food. DONNIE AZOFF, preppy-looking, 25, with horn-rims and bright white teeth approaches from the takeout counter.
DONNIE That your Jag in the lot?

Yeah.

Nice ride.
JORDAN

DONNIE Donnie Azoff.
JORDAN Jordan Belfort.
DONNIE
I’ve seen it around. We live in the same building. Twelfth floor?
(Jordan nods) What do you do, bro?
JORDAN Stock broker.
DONNIE
Kids furniture, me and my brother-in-law. Making any money?
JORDAN Seventy grand last month.
DONNIE
Get the fuck out. You made seventy grand in one month.
JORDAN Seventy two actually.
Donnie studies him, isn’t sure if he’s full of shit.
DONNIE
Tell you what. You show me a pay stub with $72,000 on it, I’m quitting my job right now and coming to work with you.
As Jordan retrieves his briefcase to find a paystub --	*

DONNIE (CONT’D)	* Holy shit.
Jordan watches as Donnie crosses to a pay phone and dials.
JORDAN (V.O.) And he did quit his job, which I thought was a little weird. I mean I had just met this fucking guy.
A few beats, then into phone:
DONNIE
Yo Paulie, it’s Donnie... Yeah, listen, I quit.
Jordan studies Donnie as he continues his conversation...
JORDAN (V.O.) There were other things about him
too, like his phosphorescent white teeth and the fact that he wore horn rims with clear lenses to look more Waspy. He also married his first cousin --
31	SCENE 31 OMITTED	31

32	INT. BAR - DAY (JUN ‘88)	*32
Jordan sits in mid-conversation with Donnie over beers.
DONNIE
No problem, if we have a kid who’s a retard, we’ll just leave it on the steps of some institution.
And as they continue drinking...
JORDAN (V.O.)
He was also a closet drug fiend. I’d known him less than a week before he talked me into smoking crack.

33	EXT. BACK OF BAR - DAY (JUN ‘88)	*33
Jordan and Donnie get high. Donnie holds a flame under a crack pipe.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	18.

JORDAN (V.O.)
The weird thing was when he’d do crack, his face would contort into this bizarre, frozen mask like the Phantom of the Opera.
Donnie does a hit of crack; his jaw twitches, then his facial muscles contort, locking up like a stroke victim. After a few beats, he hands the pipe to Jordan.
DONNIE You now, take a hit!
Jordan takes a deep hit and holds it. A beat, then:
JORDAN Omigod, I fuckin’ love you!!
JORDAN (V.O.) I knew I had to make him my partner.

34	INT. INVESTOR’S CENTER - DAY (SEP ‘88)	34
Jordan looks on as Donnie works the phone like a madman.
JORDAN (V.O.) Which turned out to be a great move - Donnie was a fast learner who transitioned into the penny stock business quickly.

Jordan and Donnie pull up to a defunct auto body shop, which has a “For Lease” sign in the window.

Jordan sits with CHESTER MING, ROBBIE FEINBERG, ALDEN KUPFERBERG (”SEA OTTER”) and BRAD, muscular and bald, with a Fu Manchu mustache.
JORDAN (V.O.) In addition to Donnie, I also
recruited my friends Sea Otter,	* Chester and Robbie, who were at	* the time all middling pot dealers.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	19.

As a WAITRESS serves cheeseburgers:
JORDAN
--see everyone wants to get rich, so you’re already half way there by the time the call starts.
SEA OTTER
I sold weed once to this Amish dude, had one of those beards with no mustache?
ROBBIE FEINBERG So?
SEA OTTER
He only wanted to make furniture.
CHESTER MING What’s that got to do with anything?
SEA OTTER
He just said everyone wants to get rich.
ROBBIE FEINBERG (to Jordan)
That’s true, you did.
SEA OTTER Buddhists too, they don’t give a shit about money either.
CHESTER MING
Man I could sell weed to anybody, get a convent full of nuns fucking wasted.
And as Brad looks at Jordan and shakes his head:

37	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - BULLPEN	37 (OCT ‘88)
We see the above guys working the phones.
JORDAN (V.O.) Brad, the guy I really wanted,

JORDAN (V.O.) They were absolute morons, my
friends, but like I always said--

39	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO BODY SHOP - BULLPEN - DAY	39 (OCT ‘88)
Jordan emerges from his office into the garage area
(the bullpen), looking on as Donnie, Chester, Robbie, Sea Otter and four other BROKERS (now including RUGRAT and Toby) make sales calls from the cheap desks.
JORDAN (V.O.) Give me them young, hungry and stupid and in no time I’ll make them rich.

40	EXT. MARINA - LONG ISLAND - SUNSET (MAY ‘89)	40
On lounge chairs at the edge of a dock, bottle of wine nearby, Jordan sits with Teresa. He smiles as she opens a jewelry case -- inside is a diamond tennis bracelet.
TERESA Omigod. Jordan.
JORDAN You like it?
TERESA It’s beautiful.
Jordan helps her try it on. She smiles, but he detects a wave of... something.
JORDAN
They’re small, I know, but the stones are really high quality.
TERESA No, no. I love it.

Then what?
They sit in silence.
JORDAN

Finally:
TERESA
I don’t know, it’s just -- these stocks, these crappy companies.
JORDAN
In five years the Corleone family will be completely legitimate.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	21.

TERESA
Why can’t you be legitimate now?
JORDAN It’s not illegal, Teresa,
technically. I mean they’re real stocks, they’re just...
TERESA
Never gonna make anybody money. (a few beats; then)
Wouldn’t you feel better selling this junk to rich people, who can afford to lose the money at least?
JORDAN
Rich people don’t buy penny stocks.
TERESA Why not?
And on Jordan’s look:
JORDAN (V.O.) Because they’re too smart, that’s why not.

The camera PUSHES IN on Jordan as he stands before a large dry erase board.
JORDAN (V.O.)
But what if they didn’t sound like jerk-offs? What if I took this bunch of nincompoops and molded them in my own image? I reinvented the company, gave it a new image, a new name. Something patrician, blue-blooded, something that reeked of tradition and anti-semitism.
And as his Brokers settle in to folding chairs--
JORDAN Gentlemen, welcome to Stratton
Oakmont. The clients we’ve gone after in the past -- they’re done. We will now target exclusively the wealthiest one percent of Americans. The methods we’ve used -- over. Loud, obnoxious sales hype is worthless with these people.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	23.
JORDAN (CONT'D)
In military terms it’s like carpet-bombing -- noisy, menacing and only marginally effective. As Stratton brokers you will be laser-guided smart-bombs aimed at high-priority targets. You will establish an initial relationship with your clients selling only blue chip stocks -- then and only then will you attempt to sell the pink sheets, where the real money is. Now the key to every sale is this:
Jordan writes the word “URGENCY” on the board.
JORDAN (CONT’D)
No one buys stock unless he thinks it’s going up and going up now. You must convince your client to buy before the takeover happens, before the lawsuit is settled, before the patent is granted.
If he says I’ll think about it and call you back, it’s over, you’re dead! No one calls back! So you have to create urgency --

48	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT I - AUTO SHOP BULLPEN - DAY	48
Another day. With Stratton Oakmont signage visible in the b.g., Jordan is on speakerphone with a potential CLIENT, the other Brokers listening in.
JORDAN
--and once Kodak settles the lawsuit, institutions will be permitted to buy their shares in large blocks again. And when that happens, which is any day now, what do you think will happen to the price of Kodak stock?
CLIENT (O.S.) It’ll go up?
JORDAN
Exactly. Which is why you should pick up 5000 shares today, a $200,000 investment.

CHESTER MING About to close?
JORDAN
No, you sweet and sour douchebag! We’re at the beginning of the beginning! This is where the sale starts. You as a salesman are almost hoping he says no so you can finally do your fucking job!

JORDAN
He doesn’t know, he needs to think, he’s gotta ask his wife! The fact is it doesn’t matter what the fuck he says! If he’s already agreed that the stock’s going up, then the only real objection he has at this point is he doesn’t trust you! And he shouldn’t trust you, you’re a fucking salesman! So what do you say?

Donnie talks on the phone to a Client.
DONNIE
Let me ask you this, sir -- had I been your broker for the past three to four years and made you money on a consistent basis, you probably wouldn’t say you need to think about it, you’d probably say pick me up three or four thousand shares, am I right?
CLIENT #2 (O.S.) Maybe.

shave her thick brown mane. The place goes nuts.
JORDAN (CONT’D) FYI, Danielle tells me she’s using the money for breast implants! Is this a great company or what?!!
More wild applause as Jordan signals across the bullpen to Donnie. We hear the opening strains of “Stars & Stripes Forever” as he opens the door to a
COLLEGE MARCHING BAND
dressed in underwear and hats. The music continues as somersaulting GYMNASTS and BATON-TWIRLERS bring up the rear. As they march through the bullpen to cheers--
FROM THE KITCHEN -- two dozen TUXEDO-CLAD WAITERS emerge carrying trays of champagne and hors d’oeuvres. The music continues as two dozen STRIPPERS bolt in, gyrating among the BROKERS. As Jordan surveys the insanity:

Bustling with activity. Jordan enters, crosses toward his office. Off to the side of the bullpen, he notices three dozen YOUNG MEN in business suits. He approaches his assistant JANET, 20s, dressed all in black.
JORDAN The hell’s all this?

The Forbes article. They’re applying for jobs.
They spot Jordan, start clamoring, waving their resumes.
JOB APPLICANTS Mr. Belfort! Over here! Sir!

JORDAN (V.O.) Forbes had made me a superstar. Every day dozens of money-crazed kids beat a path to my door with resumes they hadn’t even bothered to spellcheck.
Jordan crosses through the packed bullpen, where 150 BROKERS, no older than 22, are crammed elbow to elbow talking into phones. Some have pets, which they tend to while they work -- iguanas, snakes, turtles, even a chimp. Others are getting shoulder rubs by Masseuses or being fitted for suits by a TAILOR. Over the above:
JORDAN (V.O.)
If we hired ‘em, they dropped out of college overnight and blew whatever allowance they had on a new suit from our in-house tailor. The median age of our brokerage couldn’t get served in the bar down the street.

DONNIE	* If you want a cracker or something	* - I’m gonna have some treats in my	* pocket. I want to be in a strip	* club with you guys. Literally pull	* out a brief case and have a little	* fuckin' guy pop out of there. You	* know how much fuckin' pussy you	* get?	*
JORDAN	* The point is get it out.	*
DONNIE	* Get the jokes out now. Get the	* fuckin’ jokes out now.	*
JORDAN	* You’re gonna fuck it up. Purge all	* this shit right now.	*
DONNIE	* That’s what I’m saying -	*
JORDAN	* When he comes in the room, I want	* him to feel like a human being -	*
DONNIE	* Business. Business. It’s fuckin’	* business, bro.	*
JORDAN	* I want him to feel just like a	* normal human being. Cause you know	* - like one of us. One of us.	*
DONNIE	* Like he’s an actual human being.	* One of us.	*
JORDAN	* Gobble, gobble we accept you, one	* of us! One of us!	*
ALL	* One of us.	*
Janet pokes her head in.	*
JANET
Your dad’s coming. With the American Express bill.
JORDAN Can you stop him?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	36.

JANET Fuck you, you stop him.
The guys straighten up and head to desk, settle in. Max	* blows in past her, waving a 3-inch-thick bill:
MAX
$430,000 dollars in one month!! Four-hundred-and-thirty-thousand dollars in one month!!
JORDAN
Hello, Father.	* (Max’s expression
doesn’t budge)
They’re business expenses. Just	* relax.	*
The guys titter at “business expenses.”
MAX
If you bastards don't wipe those smug fucking looks off your faces, I swear to God I'm gonna wipe ‘em off for you!
(back to Jordan) Are you insane?
ROBBIE	* Actually, Max, my portion of the
bill is hardly anything, so I’m on the same page as you --
MAX
Shut the fuck up, Feinberg, you only have a portion because of my son, you worthless twerp!
DONNIE (chuckles)
Twerp.
MAX
You zip it, too, Azoff, those boiling teeth of yours are hurting my fucking eyes!
(turning to Jordan)
My own son! From my very loins!
What do you think this is?	*
JORDAN Will you calm down --
MAX
You don't think there's any end in sight, do you? It's all one giant party to you schmendricks!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	37.
MAX (CONT'D) (holds up AMEX bill)
$26,000 for one dinner!!
JORDAN Donnie ordered sides.
DONNIE Yeah, that was... Sorry.
MAX (glowering)
What is EJ Entertainment? What is EJ Entertainment?!
JORDAN (restraining a grin)
You tell me, Dad.
MAX
It’s a goddamn prostitution ring is what it is!!
Jordan feigns shock, turns to Donnie: did you know it was a prostitution ring?!
DONNIE
Doesn’t the IRS allow for T&A?
MAX
It’s T&E and stop fucking with me! What kind of hookers take credit cards, anyway?!
Jordan takes the bill, starts flipping through it.
JORDAN (V.O.)
In Stratton parlance, there were three kinds of hookers. There were blue chips, the top of the line. Model material. They were priced between $300 and $500 and made you wear a condom unless you gave them a hefty tip, which I always did.

77A	A “BLUE CHIP” HOOKER FLOATS THROUGH, SURROUNDED BY	*77A STRATTON BROKERS.	*
JORDAN (V.O.) Then came NASDAQs, who were pretty, but not great, usually in the two to three hundred dollar range.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	38.

77B	A “NASDAQ” HOOKER DANCES THROUGH BULLPEN. STRATTON	*77B BROKERS WATCH.	*
JORDAN (V.O.) Finally there were pink sheets, skanks, the bottom of the barrel.

77C	A “PINK SHEET” HOOKER, COVERED IN TATTOOS, IS ON ALL	*77C FOURS AS SEA OTTER RIDES HER LIKE A PONY.	*
JORDAN (V.O.) They usually cost a hundred or less, and if you didn't wear a condom, you'd get a penicillin shot the next day and pray your dick didn't fall off.

77D	THE ABOVE-MENTIONED “PINK SHEET” HOOKER SITS ON A STOOL,	*77D AS SEA OTTER FUCKS HER.	*
JORDAN (V.O.)
Not that we didn’t fuck them, too. Believe me, we did.
Behind him, the other guys wait their turns.	*
77E	BACK TO SCENE	77E
Max continues to steam so Jordan ushers Robbie, Rugrat and Donnie out the door.
JORDAN
Give us a minute, will you, guys?
He closes the door, then stretches a bit, exaggeratedly, letting out a little moan.
MAX What’s the matter?
JORDAN
Nothing, just... My back’s been killing me. Pain shooting down my leg. Not to worry, it’ll pass.
MAX
What do the doctors say?
JORDAN
Doctors, what do they know? I’m on like twenty different medications.
(re: the Amex bill)
Look, I know it's hard for you to make sense of these expenses, but
there's a method here, okay?	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	39.

Max waits to hear it; Jordan gestures to the bullpen	*
MAX
And you have to lead by example, is that it?
(Jordan nods)
I’m tellin’ ya, kid, one of these days... one of these days the
chickens are gonna come home to	* roost.
JORDAN	* In order to keep these guys	* working, I gotta keep ‘em	* spending. I need to keep them	* chasing the dream. You flash some	* cash, they do the same. It keeps	* them motivated.	*
MAX	* Pissing away money? That’s what	* motivates you kids?	*
JORDAN	* I could afford to pay them more,	* but then they wouldn't need me as	* much. And as long as they need me	* they'll always fear me. I know it	* sounds crazy.	*
MAX	* Crazy? This... is obscene.	*
He turns and exits. Jordan watches him go, thinking.
JORDAN (V.O.)
It was obscene -- in the normal world. But who wanted to live there?

78	EXT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - DAY (JUN ‘92)	78
Massive, with an Olympic-size pool overlooking the beach. Dozens of luxury cars parked outside. On a balcony, Jordan is mid-speech, in a bathing suit, addressing the Strattonites below, Teresa at his side.
JORDAN (O.C.)
-- so enjoy yourselves, you all deserve a celebration. ‘Cept for
Kimmie, she’s lazy and she steals.	* (off laughter, Kimmie	*
flips him the bird; he blows her a kiss)
But, everybody, keep this in mind.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	40.
JORDAN (O.C.) (CONT'D) As my friend Donnie Azoff says,
“If you wanna party with the boys, you gotta wake up with the men.” Monday morning I want you all looking razor-sharp. Cuz Stratton’s got a few things on the horizon, things that’re gonna take it right up into the fucking stratosphere!
The Crowd goes nuts. One Broker lets loose a wolf-howl, and the crowd toasts Jordan, chanting his name.
CROWD
Jor-dan! Jor-dan! Jor-dan!
As Jordan looks down smiling like a benevolent dictator --
JORDAN (PRE-LAP) Fuck Merrill Lynch, this way we become the underwriters.
ROBBIE (PRE-LAP)	* Like an investment bank.

79	INT. BEACH HOUSE - SOUTH HAMPTON - (LATER THAT) DAY	79
GORGEOUS PEOPLE dance/drink/snort coke. Upstairs, Jordan plays pool with Sea Otter, Donnie, Robbie, Toby and Rugrat, assigning ludes with every pocketed ball.
JORDAN
Exactly. We do our own IPO’s and we will print money.
SEA OTTER
Eat like a bird, shit like an elephant, baby!
JORDAN
They can take their Harvard asses under our desks and suck our cocks.
(to Rugrat)
How soon can you get the paperwork filed?
RUGRAT (super-stoned)
Can’t we talk about this Monday?
JORDAN
It’s a simple fucking question.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	41.

RUGRAT
Except I’m looking at three of you right now.
ROBBIE	* We’ve got Arncliffe National,
they’re looking to go public, we’ve got --
DONNIE (very luded)
Oh, oh, Steve... Steve...
JORDAN What?
DONNIE ...Steve... M-m-madden...
Donnie gesticulates wildly. The guys crack up. WE PUSH IN ON Donnie, practically drooling, as Jordan gives us a quick tutorial on ludes...
79A	QUAALUDE TUTORIAL	*79A
CUT TO: Extreme close up of guys doing drugs.	*
JORDAN (V.O.)
The quaalude was first synthesized in 1951 by an Indian doctor --that’s dot Indian, not feathers --as a sedative, and was prescribed to stressed housewives with sleep disorders. Pretty soon someone figured out that if you resisted the urge to sleep for fifteen minutes, you got a pretty kick-ass high from it. Didn’t take long for people to start abusing ludes, ‘course, and in 1982 the U.S. Government Schedule One’d them, along with the rest of the world. Which meant there was only a finite amount of these things left. No shit, you can’t even find ‘em anymore today. You people’re all shit outta luck.

79B	BACK TO SCENE	*79B
JORDAN (to Donnie)
What’re you saying, buddy? (to the others)
Shhhh... listen to him...
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	42.

DONNIE Ssshhhhoes... shhhoooess...
Jordan suspects Donnie may actually be onto something. But just then...
SEA OTTER Holy fuck.
Jordan peers over the balcony where Sea Otter’s looking.
NAOMI LAPAGLIA. 22, the hottest blonde ever, has entered the party with her date BLAIR. She smiles, full lips parting over perfect white teeth, a ridiculously short dress barely covering her long tan legs and full breasts.
RUGRAT
My nutsack’s about to explode.
ROBBIE	* Someone’s gotta take that down.
There’s no debate who that someone should be. Eyes locked on Naomi, Jordan makes his way downstairs.
WITH NAOMI taking in the party, her eyes flitting to things: art, chandeliers, crystal, etc.
NAOMI (V.O.)
A lotta people would look at me and think: “golddigger, she’s out to land the richest husband she can.” But you see, I came from nothing. Like, below the poverty line. And when you come from nothing, being rich means never having to go back to that.
Jordan approaches CRISTY, 20s, one of his guests.
CRISTY Jordan, hey.
(he smiles; Cristy picks up his intent)
Have you met my friend Naomi?
Jordan takes Naomi’s hand, doesn’t let go.
JORDAN Naomi.
NAOMI
You have an awesome house. I don’t think I’ve ever been in a house like this.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	43.

JORDAN
You like it? I just got it. I guess it’s okay. Six bedrooms, two hot-tubs, one off the master suite overlooking the water. You like to jet-ski?
Naomi’s date Blair offers his hand to break them apart. Toby Welch lurks behind him, giving him the evil-eye.
BLAIR
Hi. Blair Hollingsworth.
Jordan barely acknowledges him, focused on Naomi.
Outside, HILDY AZOFF chats with Teresa. Her eyes stray to Jordan chatting up Naomi. Teresa’s eyes follow hers and sees them. Ouch. Hildy goes.
JORDAN
You’re telling me you’ve never jet-ski’ed in your life?!
NAOMI Never.
BLAIR
Y’know, we really should hit it, there’s two other parties we’re s’posed to get to --
JORDAN
What? You just got here. Stay.
Naomi looks like she’d like to. Hildy approaches, introduces herself, then:
HILDY
Jordan, Teresa needs your help.
JORDAN With what?
HILDY
I dunno, you’ll have to ask your wife what she wants.
Jordan sees: Teresa is watching from afar.
DONNIE(O.S.) Oh sweet Jesus!
Jordan turns to see a drunk Donnie, cock in hand, jerking off to Naomi. Hildy comes running over.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	44.

Donnie! doing?!
HILDY
What the fuck are you
During the melee that follows -- Hildy admonishing Donnie, Blair removing Naomi from the party --
JORDAN (V.O.)
The day I met Naomi was the day I truly became the Wolf. Every guy wanted her -- so I had to have her.
-- Jordan watches her go. Naomi shoots a glance back to him and, like that, he’s hooked.

80	SCENES 80 - 81 OMITTED	80

82	INT. SIGN OF THE DOVE - MANHATTAN - NIGHT (JUN ‘92)	82
Romantic; elegant. Over a bottle of ‘53 Lafite, Jordan sits in mid conversation with Naomi, who is stunning in a low-cut black cocktail dress.

Bay Ridge. Island?
JORDAN
That’s near Staten
NAOMI
Brooklyn, across the Verrazano Bridge. Guinea gulch. Ever been?
JORDAN You’re Italian?
NAOMI
My dad’s side. Also Dutch, German, English -- I’m a mutt. Actually I have family over there, in London. My Aunt Emma.
JORDAN That explains it then.
NAOMI What?
JORDAN (smiles)
You’re a Duchess. The Duchess of Bay Ridge.
Naomi smiles, flags a passing WAITER.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	45.

NAOMI
Could I have a straw please?
The Waiter nods, heads off. A few beats, then:
NAOMI (CONT’D) So I was a little surprised you asked Cristy for my number.
JORDAN How come?
NAOMI Aren’t you married?
JORDAN
Married people can’t have friends?
Naomi smiles. The Waiter brings the straw. She opens it, slips it in her red wine glass. Off Jordan’s look:
NAOMI
So I don’t stain my teeth.
And as she sips the wine seductively through the straw...

83	EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - NIGHT	83
Jordan’s Ferrari makes its way over the bridge, heading back toward Brooklyn.
NAOMI (O.S.)
--then at night I do my designs.

84	INT. JORDAN’S FERRARI - CONTINUOUS	84
Jordan drives, Naomi next to him.
NAOMI
An entire line of lingerie --camisoles, bustiers, panties.
Jordan glances over -- her dress is riding up her thigh.
JORDAN (V.O.) She designs panties?! Jesus fucking Christ!
Naomi smiles.
JORDAN
Sounds like something I might invest in. Venture capital.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	46.

NAOMI
Well we should definitely keep in touch, then.
JORDAN Absolutely.
He pulls over outside her brownstone.
NAOMI That’s me.
JORDAN (V.O.) Think, Jordan, think! How can you get up to her apartment?!
They look at each other. We can almost hear Jordan’s heart pounding.
NAOMI
You wanna come up for some tea?

85	INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - NIGHT	85
A small, cozy apartment. Naomi enters, Jordan close behind. She picks up Rocky, her yapping Maltese.
NAOMI Say hi, Rocky.
Naomi waves Rocky’s paw. Jordan smiles.
NAOMI (CONT’D)
Why don’t you light a fire? I’ll be right out.
Jordan nods, takes in her scent as she walks away.
JORDAN (V.O.) God, please help me. How can I fuck this girl?
As he crouches by the fireplace, his skypager vibrates. He checks the readout: “Teresa”. His face falls as he hits the “silent” button, mind racing with guilt.
JORDAN (V.O.) That’s it, you’re leaving. You’re going home to your wife.
Jordan stands, turns around -- NAOMI is in the doorway, naked except for high heels.
JORDAN (V.O.) As you can probably guess, I fucked her goddamn brains out.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	47.

86	INT. NAOMI’S BEDROOM - NIGHT	86
Rocky yaps incessantly as Jordan pounds away atop Naomi.
JORDAN (V.O.) For eleven seconds.
Jordan cums loudly, convulsively.
JORDAN I’m sorry, I--
NAOMI Did you cum?
JORDAN (nods; gasping)
Yeah, but I’m still hard.
Jordan looks down at her.
JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) Being inside her... was like your cock went to heaven and God
himself was cupping your balls.
And as they start fucking again...

87	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY	87 (JUN ‘92)
Jordan sits at his desk, telephone to his ear.
JORDAN (V.O.) I couldn’t get enough.

88	INT. NAOMI’S APARTMENT - DAY (JUN ‘92)	88
CLOSE ON Naomi, who talks on the phone, smiling. We PULL BACK to see the apartment is packed with flowers.
JORDAN (V.O.) Every chance we got, we’d sneak off together...

89	INT. LIMOSINE - NIGHT (AUG ‘92)	89
Giggling like a child, Jordan pours coke from a vial, creating a little mound atop one of Naomi’s breasts.
JORDAN Hold still, don’t move.
(to the Driver) Watch the potholes!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	48.

More giggling, then he snorts the coke off her breast, burying his face in it as he climbs on top of her. Naomi laughs uncontrollably as the limo glides to a stop. The door opens from outside -- the Doorman?
TERESA (O.S.) Get out of the fucking car.
Jordan looks up, locks eyes with Teresa. He jumps off Naomi, stumbles out, closing the door behind himself.

90	EXT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS	90
JORDAN
What are you doing home?
TERESA
That whore from the party? How could you do this to me?!
The limo takes off. Teresa starts crying...
JORDAN
I thought you were at the beach house, I--
TERESA
I married you when you had nothing--
JORDAN Teresa... I don’t know what to say.
TERESA
You’re like a totally different person.
JORDAN
I’m not. I’m sorry. I made a mistake, okay?
TERESA
Tell me you don’t love her.
JORDAN I...
TERESA (off his silence)
Jordan?
Jordan says nothing. Finally, Teresa starts sobbing.
JORDAN (V.O.) I felt horrible.
Jordan holds her, letting her cry.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	49.

JORDAN (V.O.) Three days later I filed for divorce and moved Naomi into the apartment.

91	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - DINING ROOM - DUSK	91 (SEP ‘92)
Completely remodelled, all new furniture. Jordan and Naomi sit at the table, set for a candle-light dinner.
JORDAN (V.O.)
Say what you will, but the Duchess did have style. She brought in a decorator, feng shui’d the place--she even hired a gay butler.
NICHOLAS THE BUTLER, 40s, enters with hot towels on a silver tray.
JORDAN Thank you, Nicholas.
Jordan takes a towel, wipes his face. Naomi smiles.
JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) He was smart, sophisticated,
really great. Except for that one time...

92	SCENES 92 - 94 OMITTED	*92

95	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT	*95
A GAY ORGY is in progress, a dozen naked MEN, including Nicholas, in various sexual positions about the room.
NAOMI Omigod!

96	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT	96
Jordan sits across from a very shaken Naomi.
NAOMI
He must have thought I was at my mother’s.
JORDAN
Where were they? In the bedroom?
NAOMI They were right here!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	50.

A beat, then Jordan realizes. He jumps off the couch like it’s on fire.
NAOMI (CONT’D) It gets worse. After I chased
them out, I checked the apartment.
JORDAN (V.O.)
The motherfucker stole fifty grand in cash and jewelry.

97	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - LIBRARY - DAY	97 (OCT ‘92)
With Nicholas seated in a chair, Jordan sits across from him. Pacing behind him is Donnie, coked-up, face contorted, frothing with rage. Nearby, giant Chester Ming sits quietly, saying nothing.
JORDAN
I just want my stuff back, okay?
NICHOLAS THE BUTLER I didn’t take anything.
DONNIE (in his face)
I should kill you, cocksucker! You do not fuck with this man!
Jordan holds Donnie off. Turns back to Nicholas.
JORDAN
You were high, things got out of control, I get it. Believe me I do, I have a Phd in debauchery.
NICHOLAS THE BUTLER I didn’t do it.
DONNIE
I’ll knock your fuckin’ teeth out, motherfucker!
JORDAN
Just give me the money, give me the jewelry, and we’ll forget the whole thing.
NICHOLAS THE BUTLER It’s because I’m gay, isn’t it?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	51.

JORDAN
Nicholas. You could fuck a baby sheep as far as I care, on my brand new fucking sofa. What I won’t stand for is being robbed.
NICHOLAS THE BUTLER I’m telling you the truth.
JORDAN
I’ll ask you one last time.
DONNIE
You’re dead, you piece of shit!
NICHOLAS THE BUTLER Jordan, please.
JORDAN Fine.
Jordan nods to Chester. Without a word, he crosses to Nicholas and BAMMM!! Nicholas’s nose splits open like a ripe plum, blood spurting everywhere. Tough-guy Donnie takes one look, then SPEWS vomit into a garbage pail. And as Chester pummels Nicholas’s face into chopped meat...
JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) It’s amazing the kind of loyalty money will buy. I mean Chester almost killed this prick.
Chester starts to hang Nicholas over the balcony by his legs. Jordan stops him.
JORDAN (V.O.)
I finally called the cops, mainly to save Nicholas’s life.

98	INT. JORDAN’S MANHATTAN APARTMENT - FOYER - DAY	98
With the bloodied Nicholas in the background, Jordan talks to two NYPD COPS, handing them each a wad of cash.
JORDAN (V.O.)
I gave them each a thousand bucks and told them what Nicholas had done. Then they kicked his ass.
As the Cops swat Nicholas with their nightsticks:

COP #1 Fuckin’ thief, huh?
COP #2 Piece of shit.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	52.

And as they hustle Nicholas out...
JORDAN (V.O.) Loyalty, like I said. Which was the key component to my incredible fucking success.

98A	EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY (OCT ‘92)	98A
As Jordan golfs with Donnie, Chester, Robbie, Toby and	* some hookers, Brad pulls up in a golf cart with a cash-	* filled gym bag.
JORDAN (V.O.) Besides Brad, I had eight other ‘ratholes’, close friends who’d own stock on paper, but kick the profits back to me after I drove the price through the roof.
They hug, then Jordan adds the gym bag to several others on the back of his golf cart. Donnie tries to befriend Brad; Brad isn’t interested.
JORDAN (V.O.)
The SEC knew I was doing something shady, but they couldn’t figure out what the fuck it was.

99	SCENES 99 - 100 OMITTED	99

101	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - (ANOTHER) DAY	101
Jordan, Max and securities lawyer MANNY RISKIN exit the kitchen with coffees.
MANNY RISKIN I’m telling you -- piss on the
SEC’s leg, you’ll end up with your tits in a ringer.
FREEZE FRAME - Manny stuffs a cruller into his mouth.
JORDAN (V.O.) My securities attorney, Manny
Riskin. Seven hundred an hour to	* be the voice of doom.
BACK TO SCENE
JORDAN
It’s under control. Will you relax already?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	53.

Just then, Max spots a BROKER break-dancing as three other Brokers look on...
MAX
What the fuck is this imbecile doing?!
Max crosses off, starts screaming at the break-dancing Broker. Jordan keeps walking with Manny.
JORDAN (V.O.)
The SEC sent two lawyers down to review our files, so I set them up in our conference room.
Jordan passes the conference room, looks in the window--two SEC ATTORNEYS wear coats as they review documents.
JORDAN (V.O.) Then I had it bugged and the air conditioning locked till it felt like Antarctica in there.
One of the SEC Attorneys blows into his hands for warmth. Manny follows Jordan toward the bullpen, his frenzied Brokers working the phones.
JORDAN (V.O.)
So here they were, looking for a smoking gun while I was firing a bazooka right under their noses. It was our first IPO, and we were driving the stock price to the fucking moon.
BROKER #1 Arncliffe National, it’s on fire!
BROKER #2 (voice lowered)
Believe me, your grandkids will thank you.
BROKER #3 (to Sales Assistant)
Arncliffe National, ten thousand shares!
Jordan speaks directly to camera as he continues walking through the bullpen.
JORDAN
See an IPO is an initial public offering, the first time a stock is offered for sale to the general population.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	54.
JORDAN (CONT'D) As the firm taking the company public, we set the initial price,
then sold those shares back to --	* (stops; then)
You know what, you’re probably not	* following what I’m saying. The	* question is, “was it legal?”	* Absolutely not. But we were making	* more money that we knew what to do	* with.	*

NAOMI (O.C.) Omigod!!

104	INT. FOUR SEASONS RESTAURANT - NIGHT (OCT ‘92)	104
Jordan is down on one knee, proposing; Naomi hyperventilates as he puts the ring on her finger -- a seven carat, yellow canary diamond in a platinum setting.

The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	55.

Various images -- Stratton Brokers drink, do coke, a half-dozen in mid-orgy with Hookers, naked in the aisle as others pour champagne on them.
JORDAN (V.O.) All told, the weekend cost me almost two million dollars--

The Tangiers Presidential Suite is a shambles on the	* level of Hiroshima. A giant crystal chandelier lays shattered on the floor; Jordan asleep in the massive bed,

JORDAN (V.O.)
But the wedding was like something out of a fairy tale--

109	EXT. OCEAN CLUB - BAHAMAS - SUNSET (DEC ‘92)	109
Gorgeous; tropical. Hundreds of FAMILY and FRIENDS (Janet, Toby Welch, Peter DeBlasio and Kimmie Belzer) look on as Jordan and Naomi walk up the aisle.

As Jordan and Naomi mingle with a few Strattonites, videographer BARRY KLEINMAN, 40s, approaches Rugrat and his DATE, ABBY with a video camera:
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	56.

BARRY KLEINMAN I’m Barry Kleinman, filming the wedding -- would you like to say something to Jordan and Naomi?
RUGRAT / ABBY Good luck! We love you!
Across the way, Naomi spots someone through the crowd--
NAOMI Omigod! Aunt Emma!
Naomi rushes over, hugs her AUNT EMMA, 50s, demure, British. Naomi turns, calls out to Jordan, who is now in a huddle with the guys, his back to her.
NAOMI (CONT’D) Jordan! Look!
Jordan turns, then crosses to them, smiling.
AUNT EMMA Jordan dear, how lovely.
JORDAN
It’s so nice to see you again.
As he leans in to hug her, Aunt Emma spots some white powder on the edge of Jordan’s nostril. Deftly, she wipes it off, smiling.
AUNT EMMA Into the donuts, I see.
JORDAN Oh, I’m--- uh...
Aunt Emma leans in to his ear.
AUNT EMMA
I lived through the 60s, my dear. Enjoy the day.
And with that, she turns back to Naomi.

112	EXT. BAHAMAS - MARINA - DAY (DEC ‘92)	112
With Naomi wearing a blindfold, Jordan leads her to the end of a long dock, expensive yachts moored everywhere.
JORDAN Careful now. You ready?
Jordan removes her blindfold -- there, towering above the others, is a stunning, 120 foot yacht.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	57.

NAOMI What is this?
JORDAN
Your wedding present. Check out the name.
She does; it’s called “Naomi”. As she squeals, hugs him-
JORDAN (V.O.) For three weeks we sailed the Naomi through the Caribbean--

113	INT. YACHT NAOMI - DAY (DEC ‘92)	113
The camera PUSHES IN past a white-jacketed STEWARD,
who opens the door to the yacht’s main salon; next we see the living room, with its full bar and leather couches; then the bedroom, with a king bed and monogrammed sheets.
JORDAN (V.O.)
--eventually taking her home to Long Island, where we’d bought a house.

114	EXT. CARIBBEAN - OPEN OCEAN - DAY (DEC ‘92 - JAN ‘93)	114
The Naomi sails the calm waters, Jordan and Naomi popping ludes, sunbathing blissfully on the deck.
JORDAN (V.O.) Seven acres on the Gold Coast of Long Island--

115-115K EXT./INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - DAY (APR ‘93)	115-115K
Various shots -- the massive house; the glistening pool; waterfall; fountains; tennis court; driving range; gazebo; gym; sauna; library; media room.
JORDAN (V.O.)
--the most expensive real estate in the world, with maids, cooks, landscapers, you name it.
115L	WE SEE the household STAFF lined up outside the house.	115L
JORDAN (V.O.)
We even had two guards who worked in shifts, both named Rocco.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	58.

116	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	116
Amid billowing piles of white Chinese silk, Jordan sleeps on his back, snoring blissfully.
JORDAN (V.O.) It was heaven on earth.
On screen WE SEE:
18 MONTHS LATER
Splash! A glass of water hits him in the face.
NAOMI
Wake up, you bag of shit!
Soaking wet, Jordan sits upright to see Naomi standing over him in a tiny pink chemise, holding an empty glass.
JORDAN The fuck are you doing?!
NAOMI Who’s Venice?
JORDAN What?!
NAOMI
Who is she?! Some little hooker you fucked last night?
JORDAN What? No! Naomi!
And as Naomi storms off for a re-fill...

117	INT. HOTEL ROOM - THE NIGHT BEFORE (FEB ‘95)	117
Jordan lies on the ground, hands tied with a lit candle	* up his ass.	*
JORDAN	* Venice, where are you?	*
VENICE, A Blue Chip Hooker, enters, pulls out a candle	* and straddles him. She drips wax on his back and pulls	* his hair.	*

118	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	118
Back to scene. Naomi holds another full glass, rocking back and forth on the balls of her feet like a fighter.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	59.

NAOMI
You were calling her name in your sleep!
JORDAN
I can explain everything.
NAOMI
Go ahead. More lies from the man who lies for a living!
JORDAN
No, really. Donnie and me, we’re investing in a condo development in Venice.
NAOMI Italy?!
JORDAN California, baby.
NAOMI Yeah, right.
JORDAN Duchess, come on.
NAOMI
Don’t ‘Duchess’ me, you scumbag. You think I don’t know what you’re up to? You’re a father now and you act like an infant!
Splash! She nails him again, crosses for more water.
JORDAN
Fuck. Naomi! Why are you so mad?
NAOMI
Where do you want me to start? How about you flying in here on your stupid helicopter at three in the morning waking up Skylar?!

119	EXT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - YARD - NIGHT (FEB ‘95)	119
Jordan crash-lands the helicopter on the driving range.	* He exits, gives Captain Dave a salute, fights his way	* through the bushes, then stumbles toward the house and	* falls into the pool, stoned out of his skull. Security	* floodlights come on and the alarm sounds.	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	60.

NAOMI (O.S.)
Does it even matter to you that I just had that driving range sodded with Bermuda grass?

120	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	120
Back to scene. Naomi holds another glass of water.
NAOMI
But why should you give a shit? You're not the one who researched the fucking thing and dealt with the fucking golf course people!
JORDAN
You’re an aspiring landscape architect?! But what happened to wine connoisseur? Oh wait, that was last month!
NAOMI Fuck you!
Naomi winds up with the water glass. Jordan stands tall, puffs himself up, arms flexed at his sides.
NAOMI (CONT’D) Stop flexing your arms, you look like a fucking imbecile.
(re: his crotch)
And don’t think that impresses me much.
Jordan looks down: he has a morning erection.
JORDAN
I wasn't flexing my arms. You're just lucky to have a husband who's in such great shape. Now get over here and kiss me!
NAOMI Kiss you?!
Splash! She nails him one last time, then storms out. He stands there dripping wet. To his erection:
JORDAN
Where the fuck were you last night?
JORDAN (V.O.)
My morning ritual. First I’d get up and fight with Naomi about whatever I did the night before.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	61.

120A	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - STEAM SHOWER - DAY	120A
Jordan stands in the steaming shower.
JORDAN (V.O.) Next it was a steam so I could sweat out whatever drugs were still in my system.

120B	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - MASTER BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS	120B
Jordan looks at himself in the mirror. His eyes are bloodshot - he looks like shit.
JORDAN (V.O.) After that I’d assess the damage.
Jordan looks at a Visine bottle - “Recommended Dosage -Two Drops”. He squirts six drops in each eye.
JORDAN (V.O.) What kind of maniac abuses eye drops?

121	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - DRESSING ROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	121
Fully dressed and standing amid hundreds of suits, Jordan pops two white pills, swigs some juice.
JORDAN (V.O.) Then I’d get dressed, take my “back pills” to get me started,
then attempt to make up with her.

122	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - SKYLAR’S ROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	122
Jordan enters the tiny pink wonderland. On the fluffy pink carpet is Naomi, now in a minidress hiked above her hips, Manolo Blahniks showing polished red toes. Between her legs sits SKYLAR, their 5-month-old daughter.
JORDAN Hey, Skylar.
NAOMI (little girl voice)
Good morning Daddy. Where’s my kiss?
Jordan kisses the baby, picks her up.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	62.

JORDAN (playing along)
Does Daddy get to kiss both his girls?
NAOMI
Ohhh, no! Daddy doesn't even get to touch Mommy for a very, very long time.
Naomi lays back on her elbows, thighs parted - she’s wearing no panties. The wind goes out of Jordan.
JORDAN
C’mon, Nay, please. You know how sorry I am. I swear I--
NAOMI (cutting him off)
Daddy shouldn’t waste his time. And from now on it's going to be nothing but short, short skirts around the house! And Mommy’s so sick and tired of wearing panties, uhhh. In fact she’s decided to throw them all away.
(parting her thighs)
So take a good look. You’ll be seeing an awful lot of it around the house, but no touching.
She licks her lips seductively. Jordan sets Skylar aside, starts grovelling.
NAOMI (CONT’D) What’s wrong, Daddy?
Naomi slips her index finger in her mouth, starts sucking it. Jordan can barely speak.
JORDAN
C’mon, why are you doing this? I said I’m sorry.
NAOMI (pouting)
Ohhhh poor, poor Dada. He loves to say how wrong he is when he’s ready to come in his own pants. Isn’t that right Dada? Mommy loves Daddy so, so much and there’s nothing she wants to do more right now than to make love to Daddy all day long. Well, I guess it’s time for Daddy to be taught his first lesson.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	63.

Naomi runs her fingers over her stomach and on to her inner thigh, then up toward her vagina. Jordan watches transfixed, then a change comes over him...
JORDAN
I wouldn’t do that if I were you Mommy. I think Mommy should hear a story before she decides to please herself like that.
Can Daddy tell Mommy a story? (off her nod)
And does mommy promise to keep her legs spread wide, wide open the whole time?
(she nods dreamily)
Good. Once upon a time there was a great big mansion in Long Island and the people who lived there had lots and lots of money. But of all the possessions they had, there was one thing that was much more valuable than all the rest combined, and that was their little baby daughter.
Naomi listens, legs still spread, hand on her crotch.
JORDAN (CONT’D) Now because he was very security-conscious, the Daddy hired two full-time guards, big hairy men both named Rocco, and they installed security cameras all around the house. And one of those cameras is right over Daddy's shoulder.
Naomi’s eyes widen -- she look toward a Teddy Bear on a shelf. WE SEE that one of the eyes is a pinhole camera.
JORDAN (CONT’D)
So smile, Mommy! You're on Candid Camera!

123	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - GUARD HOUSE - DAY (FEB ‘95)	123
Mesmerized, ROCCO DAY watches a video screen, on which we see a grainy image of Naomi, hand between her legs.

124	INT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - SKYLAR’S BEDROOM - DAY (FEB ‘95)	124
Naomi jumps up as if she’s been electrocuted.
NAOMI You asshole!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	64.

As she bolts from the room, Jordan plays with Skylar...
JORDAN (V.O.)
The good thing about living with a world-class ballbreaker is they make all the other ballbreakers in your life a little easier to take.

125	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - OUTSIDE JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY	125 (FEB ‘95)
Donnie stands talking with Jordan’s assistant, Janet. Jordan approaches under a head of steam.
DONNIE There he is.
JORDAN
(a quick hug; then) Steve here yet?
DONNIE
On his way. Very excited.
JORDAN
Good. Cuz we have a problem.
He indicates out to the Bullpen. Donnie and Janet look.
JANET (incredulous)
Is he wearing a bow tie?
In the Bullpen WE SEE a young Stratton Broker in a bowtie cleaning a small goldfish bowl on his desk.
JORDAN
He’s got nothing better to do on the day of the biggest IPO in this firm’s history?!
Jordan watches as Donnie marches toward the Broker in a bowtie...

126	INT. BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS	126
DONNIE The fuck you doing?
BROKER IN A BOWTIE (bewildered)
Cleaning my fishbowl.
DONNIE Oh.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	65.

Donnie nods, turns to go, but suddenly he turns back and thrusts his arm in the bowl, grabbing for the squirming goldfish. The Broker in a bowtie looks on, horrified.
DONNIE(CONT’D) On new issue day?! On cocksucking, motherfucking new issue day?!
Dozen of Brokers and Sales Assistants look over as Donnie snatches up the fish. Holding it by its tail, he jumps	* up on the desk of the Broker in a bowtie. Now the entire Bullpen looks over.
DONNIE(CONT’D)
This is what happens when you fuck with your pets on new issue day!
With the flair of a showman, Donnie pops the fish in his mouth, swallowing it whole. The Brokers cheer wildly. Donnie jumps down, gets in the face of the Broker in a bowtie:
DONNIE(CONT’D) Now take your bowtie, get your shit and get the fuck out!
Bowtie is stunned. And as Donnie storms off, we PUSH IN on Jordan, watching from across the room.

127	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY	127 (FEB ‘95)
Jordan finishes a phone call as Donnie enters with STEVE MADDEN, 30s, dressed in wrinkled navy blazer, cargo pants and T-shirt, a baseball cap over his scraggly, thinning hair. Jordan smiles, crosses to greet him.

The Cobbler.

Hey buddy.
JORDAN
Ready to get rich?
STEVE MADDEN
And as they ad lib greetings, settle in at the couch:
JORDAN (V.O.) Steve Madden, the shoe designer, was a childhood friend of Donnie’s, but I didn’t hold that against him. Remember those ads, those giant-headed girls with bug eyes wearing those big clunky shoes?
127A	INSERT - a quick series of Steve Madden ads.	127A
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	66.

JORDAN (V.O.)
He came to me a few years earlier when he was just starting out, so I became a silent partner in his company, buying an 85% stake for only a million bucks.

128	INT. STEVE MADDEN SHOES - DAY	128
WE SEE various stores, all packed with teenage GIRLS buying shoes and boots.
JORDAN (V.O.) The company blew up and we were
now taking it public. It was the biggest deal we’d ever done and the hottest IPO on Wall Street.

129	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY	129 (FEB ‘95)
Jordan and Donnie sit with Steve Madden in mid-conversation.
DONNIE
--which is why they need to meet you.
JORDAN
You gotta get ‘em fired up so they’ll push the shit out of this stock.
DONNIE
Let them feel your passion.

130	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY (FEB ‘95)	130
Bustling with activity. With Jordan and Donnie looking on from nearby, Steve Madden approaches a microphone on the raised platform, in his hands several shoe boxes.
STEVE MADDEN (into mic)
Uhhh... excuse me...
The place slowly comes to order.
STEVE MADDEN (CONT’D) For those of you who don't know
me, my name is Steve Madden. I'm --
ONE BROKER We know who you are!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	67.

Steve clears his throat, looks over at Jordan -- he’s terrified. Jordan motions for him to calm down.
STEVE MADDEN
I uh, I'd like to start by telling you about my background in the shoe industry.
ANOTHER BROKER Nice fucking hat!
STEVE MADDEN
I uh... first started working in the shoe industry, in a shoe store. When I was sixteen, my friends were out chasing girls, but I was learning about women's shoes.
KALIL Move the mike closer.
PETER DEBLASIO
We can’t fucking hear you!	*
He moves the mic; feedback SCREECHES through the bullpen.
STEVE MADDEN (CONT’D) Sorry... Anyway, my first job
was at a shoe store like I said where I worked in the stockroom. You know, I can honestly say I’ve been a lover of women's shoes since I was twelve--
BROKER #4 Freak!
STEVE MADDEN No. Heh-heh. Not like that.
I mean somehow I became fascinated with the endless design possibilities for women's shoes--

BROKER #5 Queer!
BROKER #6 Get a fucking life!
Boos, hisses. Steve looks at Jordan, who motions for him to speed up. He grabs a shoe from one of the boxes.
STEVE MADDEN (CONT’D) This shoe -- the Mary Lou -- is
the one that really put me on the map. It’s a black patent leather variation of the Mary Jane, but--
SPLAT! A half-eaten grapefruit lands at Steve’s feet. In a flash, Jordan rushes over, grabs the mic--
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	68.

JORDAN
All right, let's hear it for Steve Madden and the wonderful Mary Lou!
Huge applause, with stomping feet; howling, etc.
JORDAN (CONT’D) Okay, now that you got that out of your system, I want you to know why Steve is so completely off the fucking wall... It’s because this man is a creative genius. Steve's power, his gift -- is that he creates trends. Artists like Steve come along once a century! Elvis! Andy Warhol! Giorgio Armani! Who knows how high this stock could go? The 20s? The 50s? The 80s?
Applause; war whoops. Jordan motions for quiet.
JORDAN (CONT’D) I want everybody to look down.
See that little black box in front of you? It's called a telephone. Now I'm gonna let you in on a little secret about this telephone -- it won't dial itself! That’s right -- until you take some action, it's nothing more than a worthless hunk of plastic, like a loaded M16 without a trained Marine to pull the trigger. And in the case of the telephone, it's the action of you, a highly trained Strattonite, a killer who will not take no for an answer! A person who will not hang up the phone until his client either buys or fucking dies!
The Brokers go crazy. Jordan looks around.
JORDAN (CONT’D)
I don't care if you graduated from Harvard or Bumfuck University or never got past fourth fucking grade! That phone is the great equalizer!
(pause; looks around) There is no nobility in poverty.
I've been rich, and I've been poor and I choose rich every time.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	69.
JORDAN (CONT’D) At least as a rich man, when I have to face my problems, I show
up in the back of a limo wearing a $2000 suit and $40,000 gold watch!
Jordan takes off his GOLD WATCH, flings it to the Crowd. Brokers go nuts, fighting over it like a home-run ball.
JORDAN (CONT’D) And if anyone here thinks I'm crazy, get the fuck out and get a job at McDonald’s, because that's where you fucking belong! But before you depart this room full of winners, I want you to take a good look at the person next to
you, because one day in the not-so-distant future, you'll be sitting at a red light in your beat-up old Pinto, and that person’s gonna pull up in a brand new Porsche, with their gorgeous young wife at their side. And who will you be next to? Some ugly beast with three days of razor-stubble in a sleeveless moo-moo, crammed in next to you with a carload of groceries from the fucking Price Club!
He scans the Brokers; they’re on the edge of their seats.
JORDAN (CONT’D) So you listen to me and listen
carefully. Are you behind on your credit card bills? Good. Pick up the phone and start dialing. Is your landlord threatening to evict you? Good. Pick up the phone and start dialing. Does your girlfriend think you're a fucking loser? Pick up the phone and start fucking dialing! I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich! I want you to go out and spend money! Leverage yourself, back yourself into a corner, let the consequences of failure become so fucking unthinkable that you'll have no choice but to do whatever it takes to win!
The Brokers go absolutely APESHIT.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	70.

JORDAN (CONT’D) You have an obligation here,
people! To your clients! To this firm! An obligation to yourself, godammit! You ram Steve Madden stock down your clients’ throats and make them choke on it till they buy 20,000 shares! Be aggressive! Be ferocious! Be telephone fucking terrorists!!
Before Jordan is even finished, the Brokers GO BERSERK, some already dialing their phones.
JORDAN (V.O.) (CONT’D) At 1 p.m. we opened the stock for sale at $4.50 a share. By 1:03
it was over eighteen dollars.

130A	INT. FBI OFFICES - MANHATTAN - DAY	130A
Agent Denham exits the elevator, arriving for work. He strides between cubicles, briefcase in hand. He enters --

130B	INT. AGENT DENHAM’S OFFICE - DAY	130B
-- where pinned up on one wall is a massive chart on Stratton’s operations: pictures of Jordan, Donnie and others, a hierarchy, a history, an investigation...

131	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - LATER (FEB ‘95)	131
Total sales frenzy. The CAMERA PANS the 300 Brokers, who work the phones like mad.
SEA OTTER
--the hottest new issue on Wall Street!
YOUNG BROKER
--up two dollars while I’m talking to you!
And as we continue PANNING the room...
JORDAN (V.O.) Of course I couldn’t have done
this without help. I’d leaked the word on Wall Street that Stratton was a buyer up until twenty. So not only were we pushing Madden, all the big firms were too.
We continue PANNING the frenzied Brokers...
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	71.

JORDAN (V.O.)
As long as they knew I’d buy the shares back at the top of the market, they’d drive the price up as high as I fucking wanted.

132	SCENES 132 - 133 OMITTED	132

134	INT. JORDAN’S OFFICE - DAY (FEB ‘95)	134
Donnie pours champagne nearby, oblivious to Jordan, who sits at his desk, speaking directly to camera:
JORDAN
Of the two million shares being offered for sale, a million belonged to me, held in phony accounts by my ratholes. Once the price hit the high teens, I--
Jordan abruptly stops. A beat, then:
JORDAN (CONT’D) Like I said before, who gives a shit? As always, the point is this--
BACK TO SCENE -- Donnie hands Jordan a glass of Dom.
DONNIE
22 million in three fucking hours!
They toast, then each pop ludes, which they wash down with champagne. A quick knock; Janet pops her head in.
JORDAN Janet, baby. Drink.

Call for you. Future Video?

Who?
JANET
Barry Kleinman from

JORDAN
JANET
He filmed your wedding. He says it’s urgent.
Curious, Jordan leans over, hits the speaker phone:
JORDAN Barry?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	72.

135	INT. FUTURE VIDEO - DAY (FEB ‘95)	135
Barry Kleinman sits at his desk, talking on the phone.
BARRY KLEINMAN Jordan, hey. Listen, I got a subpoena. The FBI wants a copy of your wedding video.
On Jordan. Uh-oh.
JORDAN (V.O.) The F-B-fucking-I?

135A	INT. FIRING RANGE - DAY	135A
Wearing goggles and protective headphones, square-jawed FBI Agent Patrick Denham takes target practice.
BO DIETL (V.O.) Name’s Denham, he’s an agent in the New York office.
JORDAN (V.O.) What’s his problem?
BO DIETL (V.O.) He’s a boy scout, thinks you’re Gordon Gekko.

The East Harlem institution. Jordan sits across a table over pasta with private investigator BO DIETL, 40s.
JORDAN
But my goddamn wedding video?
BO DIETL
Got your whole inner circle in one place, faces and names. He’s hoping it rattles you, or maybe your wife, so that she starts nagging you to turn witness.
JORDAN (that’s laughable)
What? He wants me to rat on myself?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	73.

BO DIETL (shrugs)
Good news is I made some calls, DEA, Justice? No one but him even knows who you are.
JORDAN
Can you bug him or something, tap his phone?
BO DIETL Jordan, relax. First off, you
don’t fuck with these guys, not that way. Secondly, I got a P.I. license, you know?
JORDAN
Maybe I should call him, see what he wants.
BO DIETL
No! Anybody does that should be your lawyer. What you do is eat your dinner, drink your drink, and forget about it. Cuz as far as I hear he doesn’t have shit.
Jordan nods, wheels turning, pretending to do as told.

137	EXT. BATTERY PARK MARINA - DAY (LATE SPRING ‘95)	137
As Agent Denham steps into frame, another FED, AGENT	* HUGHES, beside him, both G-man stoic in impenetrably dark * glasses --
JORDAN (O.S.) Patrick? Hey! C’mon aboard!
They look up. On the yacht Naomi, Jordan stands waving, drinking wine with two Blue Chip HOOKERS in bikinis.
JORDAN (CONT’D) Plank’s right down there.
Denham shares a look with his cohort: it’s almost a joke, this display of wealth before a federal agent. Moments later, they step aboard.
AGENT DENHAM Mr. Belfort, I’m Agent Denham. This is Agent Hughes.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	74.

JORDAN Heya! This is Nicole and,
um...Heidi. Girls, Patrick and...?
AGENT DENHAM Agents Denham and Hughes. Your message said you wanted to speak privately.
JORDAN It did. I do.
(off Denham’s stare) Oh, they’re just friends.
(to the girls) Give us a minute, okay?
The Hookers head below deck. Jordan shoots Denham a wink--check out that ass!
JORDAN (CONT’D) Can I get a glass? Got wine open or any kinda booze. Shrimp and lobster’re over there if you’re hungry.
AGENT DENHAM
Bureau forbids us from drinking at sea.
Jordan surprised: the guy has a sense of humor.
JORDAN
I have something for you, I just gotta find it. Have a seat, will ya? Ever been on one of these before?
As Jordan rifles through some papers, Denham’s eyes scan the deck, casually cataloguing everything.
AGENT DENHAM
A boat? Learned to sail when I was six.
JORDAN
I mean, one like this. Just had her extended to put a chopper on the back.
Jordan points out the Bell-Jet helicopter.
AGENT DENHAM
Never been on a boat with a second mode of transportation on top of it.
Jordan finds the file he’s been looking for, offers it.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	75.

AGENT DENHAM (CONT’D) (before he’ll accept)
What is this?
JORDAN
Names and addresses of every guest at my wedding. Friends, clients. I even threw in the seating chart. Heard that’s why you wanted the video, figured this’d expedite whatever it is you’re doing.
(Denham looks: it’s indeed a guest list from the wedding)
I wanted to show you I’ve got nothing to hide. I know you’re investigating Stratton but for the life of me I can’t figure out why. Sure, my company is unorthodox; what brokerage isn’t? Maybe we’re a little louder than most but we don’t do anything illegal. Talk to the SEC, they’ll tell you, they checked us out up and down.
AGENT DENHAM The SEC’s actually a civil regulatory agency. We pursue criminal activity.
JORDAN
That’s what I’m saying. You guys take on real crime. Which is why I’m so curious: what do you think we did?
The reason Jordan asked him here, Denham realizes.
AGENT DENHAM I can’t discuss ongoing investigations.
JORDAN I understand.
AGENT DENHAM Though, to be frank, this case kinda got dumped on my desk. Some higher-up felt your shop needed looking into after all that press, fell on me to do the looking.
JORDAN
You know who you should be looking at? Goldman, Lehman Brothers, Merrill.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	76.
JORDAN (CONT'D) What those guys’re up to with collateralized debt obligations? This internet stock bullshit? C’mon. If you want, I’ll walk you through exactly --
AGENT DENHAM
-- that’d be great. And if there’s anything you can give me just to close out your file, get it off my desk--
JORDAN
-- sure, get you back to the real criminals --
AGENT DENHAM
-- then we could both profit from this little sit-down.
Jordan sizes him up: what did Denham mean by “profit”?
JORDAN
You sure you don’t want anything to drink? Water for your pal?
(Denham demurs)
Rumor is your started out in finance. Even got your broker’s license before you joined the bureau.
AGENT DENHAM Who told you that?
JORDAN (searches his memory)
Jeez, who was it...? (comes up short)
Ever regret it? Giving up the money-crazed, pin-striped life? Ever think where you’d be if you’d stuck with it?
AGENT DENHAM
When I’m riding the subway home, sweating my balls off, in a suit I’ve worn three days, sure.
JORDAN
Whattaya pull in working at the bureau, if you don’t mind me asking. 50-60K a year?
AGENT DENHAM
Just about. We get a free handgun out of it, though, that doesn’t suck.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	77.

JORDAN
S’crazy, the world we live in, the jobs with real value, the ones we should appreciate -- firefighters, teachers, FBI agents -- those are the ones we pay the least.
AGENT DENHAM Way of the world.
JORDAN
That’s one thing I like about what I do, the opportunity to make that right. Take this kid we had interning last year. Didn’t want to be a broker, wanted to be an environmental scientist or something, he had a student loan debts up to his eyeballs. Anyway, his mom gets sick, all they can afford is third-rate care. Some of us got together, made an investment on his behalf and --boom -- overnight everything changes, she’s seeing the best doctors in the country. Sadly, didn’t work out, she passed but still: having the power to do that makes all the other bullshit worth while.
(as Denham considers that)
See, it’s all about proper guidance, Pat. Knowing someone with the right relationships, who’s discreet. I can change a life almost every day.
They measure each other.
AGENT DENHAM
How much that intern make off your deal?
JORDAN North of half a million.
Denham summons Agent Hughes over. To Jordan:
AGENT DENHAM
Can you say that again, what you told me?
(Jordan declines with a smile; to Agent Hughes)
I believe Mr. Belfort just tried to bribe a federal officer.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	78.

JORDAN
What? I was making conversation.
AGENT DENHAM Sounds like that to me, Jordan.
JORDAN ...no, no, no...
AGENT DENHAM ...sounded like that...
JORDAN
...no, to constitute a bribe, don’t I have to make an explicit offer of money for services? With an exact dollar figure attached? All I said was “north” of half a million. According to the U.S. Criminal Code, that dog won’t hunt, Pat.
(then)
Heard you were a straight arrow. That you wouldn’t bend the rules other agents might. He was right.
AGENT DENHAM
You did a background check on me?
JORDAN
Figured you were looking into me, was only fair. Plus you sail on a yacht fit for a Bond villain, sometimes you gotta act the part.
AGENT DENHAM
This is why you invited me down to your yacht? With a couple hookers on it --
JORDAN
-- those are friends --
AGENT DENHAM
-- to get a sense of the guy who was coming after you?
Jordan puts his hands up: “you got me.”
JORDAN
Thanks for coming down. Now get off my boat.
AGENT DENHAM
You know, most of the Wall Street jackasses I bust, they were born to the life.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	79.
AGENT DENHAM (CONT'D) Their father was a douchebag
before them, and his father before that. But you, you got this way all on your own. Good for you, Jordan.
(as he starts to go) Thank you for having us. I’m
absolutely certain we’ll see each other again.
(before he does)
You know, this is about the nicest boat I’ve ever been on. Just think what a hero I’ll be in the office when the bureau seizes it.
Jordan watches him go, temper flaring: he can’t let Denham get the final word. He calls after them:
JORDAN
Hey, Denham! I’m gonna eat a claw of lobster now as I get my cock sucked by Heidi down below. You have a super ride home on the
subway thinking about that!	*
As he watches them pull away, seething --
JORDAN (V.O.)
He was a numbers guy, a follow-the-fucking-money’er. He wasn’t gonna come at me through my guys, looking for a weak link and a quick kill. He was gonna come at me like an accountant would, the way Ness got Capone, through my books. Which meant? It was ass-covering time.

JORDAN (V.O.) Rugrat set up a meeting with a Swiss Banker he knew from law school who could launder our money, but it wasn’t till noon the next day.
Jordan glances at his watch, washes down a few ludes.
JORDAN (V.O.)
I knew if I timed my lude intake right, I’d sleep through the entire overnight flight.

Jordan stands before the Bullpen talking to his Brokers.
JORDAN (V.O.)
At four p.m. I popped a few ludes, which started kicking in by the time I finished our sales meeting. This was the tingle phase.

141	INT. CANASTEL’S - NIGHT (SUMMER ‘95)	141
Over dinner, a visibly high Jordan ravenously digs into his food as Donnie and four Blue Chip Hookers look on.
JORDAN (V.O.) By dinner I popped a few more on top of some cocktails and an valium or two. The slur phase.

145	INT. ZURICH AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - DAY (SUMMER ‘95)	*145
Quiet; morning sunlight bleeds through the window. Jordan’s eyes flicker open. He yawns, looks around, tries to get up; he can’t move. He looks down, sees six seat belts restraining his arms and legs. Jordan looks over at Donnie, mouth agape, asleep next to him.

Donnie.

Nuuhh?
JORDAN Donnie, wake up.
DONNIE
JORDAN
Untie me, shitbag. You think this is funny?
DONNIE
I didn’t tie you, the captain did. He almost tasered you.
JORDAN Why?

146	FLASHBACK --	146
As PASSENGERS scream, Jordan wildly humps a STEWARDESS, the CAPTAIN struggling to restrain him.
JORDAN (V.O.) This was fucking great. I hadn’t laundered a dime yet and already I was under arrest.

JEAN-JACQUES SAUREL greets them. 30s, suave. The lobby is ultra-modernist.
SAUREL Jordan Belfort! At last!
Nicholas has told me so much.
RUGRAT Jordan, Jean-Jacques Saurel.
JORDAN
Nice to make your acquaintance. This is some lobby you got.
SAUREL
Ah, yes. We gave our designer an unlimited budget and he exceeded it. Come! You must tell me all about your adventure with the stewardess over coffee!
They disappear upstairs.

151	INT. BANQUE REAL DE GENEVE - SAUREL’S OFFICE - DAY	151
Jordan, Rugrat and Donnie drink coffee with Saurel and
one other SWISS BANKER. It’s an impressive office, with	* an enormous fish tank.
DONNIE
We have a joke in America. “Heaven is a place where the police are Brits, the chefs are Italian, the car mechanics are German, the prostitutes are French and the bankers are Swiss.” I never got it ‘til now -- look at those fucking fish! Come here, little guy...
SAUREL
Yes, we have the same joke here. Only sometimes the English are chauffeurs and the chefs are French. The Germans, alas, are always mechanics; no one wants to grant them more authority than that.
Polite laughter. Jordan, not as impressed by the fish, cuts straight to the point:

JORDAN
I'm curious about your bank secrecy laws.
SAUREL
Excusez-moi, Jordan, Swiss custom requires ten minutes of idle chit-chat before business can be discussed.
(a smile)
Of course, let’s get “down to it.” What would you like to know?
JORDAN
Under what circumstances would you be obligated to cooperate with an FBI or U.S. Justice Department investigation?

Ca depend.

Ca depend?
SAUREL

JORDAN
Ca depend on what?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	84.

SAUREL
Whether America plans to invade Switzerland in the coming months.
RUGRAT
Want me to see if tanks are rolling down the Rue de la Croix?
More chuckles. Through Jordan’s forced smile:
JORDAN (V.O.) What I’m asking, you Swiss dick, is are you going to fuck me over.
SAUREL (V.O.) I understand perfectly, you American shitheel.
Saurel smiles.
SAUREL
The only way the Banque Real de Geneve would cooperate with a foreign legal body is if the crime being pursued also happened to be a crime in Switzerland. But there are very few Swiss laws pertaining to your “rumored” improprieties. Which is why Mr. Azoff’s joke is most appropriate: from a financial standpoint you are now in heaven, and we welcome you. If the U.S. Justice Department or FBI or SEC or IRS sent us a subpoena, it would become papier-toillette. We would wipe our ass with it.
Everyone’s impressed. Except Jordan.
JORDAN
Unless it was an investigation into stock fraud -- which is a crime in Switzerland. Then you’d have to cooperate.
SAUREL
(now he’s impressed) Yes, we would. Assuming the account is under your name.
However, if it were in the name of a nominee of yours...
They take each other in.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	85.

JORDAN (V.O.)
Was that yodeling I just heard or did you just say what I thought you said?
SAUREL (V.O.) Yes! Yes!
As the meeting wraps up with handshakes, Jordan’s V.O. overwhelms Saurel’s V.O..
JORDAN (V.O.) He was telling me to use a
rathole. Problem was: sneaking a U.S. rathole into Switzerland was a chance I couldn’t take. What I needed was somebody with a European passport.

Amid towering trees and horse trails, a noticeably twitchy Jordan walks arm-in-arm with Aunt Emma.
AUNT EMMA
So tell me about this plan of yours.
JORDAN
I’d like us to go to Switzerland tomorrow so you can open an account. I’ll fund it, and I’ll pay you really well for your trouble.
AUNT EMMA Oh my.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	86.

JORDAN
Next month maybe you can fly to New York and we can start moving the cash.
AUNT EMMA Moving the cash.
(smiles)
I feel like a character in an
Ian Fleming novel. It’s all quite racy, isn’t it?
JORDAN
It is, and it’s illegal too. Of course if you ever got in trouble, I’d come forward in two seconds, say I duped you, but even still.
AUNT EMMA
Risk is what keeps us young, isn’t it darling?
JORDAN
I like that attitude. Promise me	* you’ll spend at least ten thousand
pounds per month out of the account, okay?
AUNT EMMA (chuckles)
I wouldn't even know how. I really do have everything I need.
JORDAN But I bet you don't have
everything you want. How about a bigger apartment so your grandkids can sleep over?
Aunt Emma notices that Jordan is sweating, fidgety. He’s jonesing.
AUNT EMMA Shall we sit?
JORDAN Sure, that’d be great.
They sit on a nearby bench. After a while:
AUNT EMMA Sometimes I wonder if you let money get the best of you, dear.
(beat)
Among other substances.

JORDAN It’s that obvious, huh?
AUNT EMMA
It’s the height of summer and	* you’ve got the chills.	*

AUNT EMMA (laughs)
Well there are worse things to be addicted to than sex.
JORDAN (chuckles; then)
Why did I just tell you that?	*
AUNT EMMA (playful)
Because I’m very easy to talk to.
Jordan looks at her. A few beats, then:
JORDAN
As a matter of fact you are. My	* job, you know, it’s tough. I mean	* I’m not complaining, it’s just the
stress. All these people depending	* on me. Millions of dollars at	* stake every day. I sometimes feel	* I’ve bitten off more than I can	* chew.	*
AUNT EMMA
You’re a man with large appetites.
Jordan looks at her and smiles:
JORDAN (V.O.) Is she fucking hitting on me?
JORDAN
I agree. I put it on myself. It’s	* hard to control the anxiety, you	* know? It’s hard to learn to relax.	*
AUNT EMMA To release the tension.
JORDAN (V.O.)
She is hitting on me! Holy shit!
Jordan leans in closer, casually slips an arm around her.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	88.

JORDAN
Exactly, to release the tension.	* Sometimes you gotta learn to do	* what comes natural in life, huh?	*
Aunt Emma pulls back slightly.
AUNT EMMA (V.O.) Is he fucking hitting on me?
He leans in even closer, kisses her, then:	*

Jordan fucks Naomi. There’s a curious thunk-thunk-thunk.
JORDAN (V.O.)
When I got home, I realized there was no way Aunt Emma could smuggle that much cash by herself. I racked my brain for another person with a foreign passport.
The bed’s covered with bundles of cash. Every thrust of Jordan’s, another bundle plummets to the floor -- thunk.

CHANTALLE
Bra-had, theese tape eez focking steeky!
As Brad keeps taping her up:
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	89.

JORDAN (V.O.)
As a successful drug dealer, Brad spent his winters in the South of France, which is where he met his wife Chantalle, a stripper of Slovenian origin but born in, of all places, Switzerland.
CHANTALLE
Take eet off, Bra-had! Eet erts!
BRAD Shut up, bitch.
CHANTALLE
You beetch, you focking douche-a-bag-a!

Chantalle is completely taped up, a cash-covered mummy. Jordan looks on with Brad, Donnie and now Naomi. 90% of the cash is still on the bed.
JORDAN Well, this is fucked.
NAOMI
It’s gonna take her like fifty trips.
BRAD
We’ll get her parents to tape up too. They got Swiss passports. Plus her brother and his wife. Five people, six-seven trips?
JORDAN
How much’ll they want for it?
BRAD
I dunno, not much. Fuck, they’d probably do it just for the miles.
DONNIE What about my money?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	90.

BRAD What?
DONNIE
My money. I got a few mil of my own I wanna move. I’ll call you, you can come pick it up.
BRAD (takes offense to
Donnie’s presumption)
You’ll “call” me.
DONNIE (what part don’t you
understand?)
And you can come “pick it up.”
Brad asks Jordan if they can speak in private.
MOMENTS LATER, IN PRIVATE: Jordan joins Brad.
JORDAN What’s wrong?
BRAD
Don’t make me deal with this fucknut, okay?
JORDAN
Donnie? He’s just high is all.
BRAD
I dunno if he’s stupid or a junkie but he’s a loose fuckin’ cannon. I don’t trust him and I don’t want him around me.
JORDAN
Jesus. I thought he was your best customer.
BRAD
I only sell to him cuz he’s your friend.
JORDAN
Can you just do one trip for him?
Brad stews. It’s asking a lot.
BRAD
I’ll meet him but I won’t pick up. I have a limit of how much of that douchebag I can take.

Donnie emerges from where he’s been eavesdropping.
DONNIE (CONT’D) I’m a douchebag?!! Well, whose fucking idea was it made us all this money?!! Who fucking knew Steve Madden?!! This douchebag!! So go fuck yourself a little!
Brad slaps Donnie so hard across the face he goes down.

DONNIE (CONT’D) I’m just fucking with you, man. Jesus, the look on your face.

Hey, sorry if I got outta line the other day, I was just, that was the drugs talking...
BRAD
S’cool, just... gimme the case.
DONNIE (he doesn’t)
You know, I always kinda regretted you didn’t come to work with us at Stratton. It’d be so cool having you around, man.
BRAD (growing impatient)
Yeah, well...
DONNIE
You’d be one of us, we’d go out-partying together, you wouldn’t have to dress like a mall rat guinea prison bitch all the time.
Donnie grins, obviously still smarting from Brad’s slap. Brad just wants to take the money and be done.
BRAD Give me the money.
A DISTANCE AWAY, a COP in a patrol car notices Brad gesturing to Donnie for his briefcase. He nudges his partner: check this out.
DONNIE
Can I come over and help tape this to your wife? “Eez so focking steeky! Take eet off, Bra-hod!”

That does it. Brad attacks. Donnie throws the case at him, which opens on impact, money spilling out. Brad instinctively tries to contain it... and that’s when the POLICE SIRENS start. Here comes the patrol car.
BRAD Shit!
Donnie bolts. With no time to get to his car, Brad takes off on foot, bleeding briefcase in hand, toward a video store where he stashes his .38 in the return box.

NAOMI (O.S.) Omigod! Jordan, where are you?!
JORDAN Whazz a marra?
NAOMI (O.S.)
It’s Donnie, he’s totally out of control! He’s on the other line with some Swiss guy!
Jordan’s face reads horror.
JORDAN Whaa?!! No!!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	100.

NAOMI (O.S.)
I can’t understand you! Just get home, hurry!
Naomi clicks off. And as Jordan puts the car in gear...
JORDAN (V.O.) They say God protects drunks and babies. I was praying the same held true for drug addicts.

JORDAN (V.O.)
I was less than a mile from home and drove slower than shit.

Jordan pulls up in the Lamborghini, shuts the ignition.
JORDAN (V.O.) Somehow I made it alive, not a scratch on me or the car.

With all the strength he can muster, Jordan RIPS the phone from the wall, throwing it skittering across the floor with a CLANG.
NAOMI

DONNIE
Wazza fuh is wrong wizzz oooo?!! I wuzz awwing to!!

Wazza mazzer?! Wazza yoo razy?!!
Skylar looks on from the next room, crying as Jordan
tries to shake some sense into Donnie. Naomi crosses to	* Skylar and rushes her out of the room.	*

JORDAN WUZZ ZOD IN ZAW?!
DONNIE WUZZ?!
Fuck it. Jordan releases Donnie. Donnie crawls into the	* dining room and starts shoving ham into his mouth in an	* effort to sober up. Just then, we HEAR a horrible	* GAGGING sound. Donnie holds his throat as he falls	* backward choking, taking out the entire glass kitchen
table with a tremendous CRASH! Naomi rushes back in.	*
NAOMI
Omigod, he’s choking! Jordan, do something!!
Just then, WE HEAR the triumphant Popeye FANFARE --Jordan looks to the TV, where POPEYE pours a can of spinach down his gullet. Instantly, his chest and arm muscles swell to five times their size.
Jordan goes to get his coke. He snarfs up two fat spoonfuls and -- like that -- his chest swells and he takes a deep breath and he dashes back to the rescue...
Jordan rushes back to Donnie, who is now blue.
NAOMI (CONT’D) He’s not breathing!
Jordan places his fingers over Donnie’s artery. Nothing.
NAOMI (CONT’D) Save him!
Jordan kneels, starts furiously pumping Donnie’s chest, breathing air into his lungs in rhythmic bursts.
JORDAN (V.O.) This stupid sonovabitch! All
Donnie ever did was fuck me up and now I had to save his life ‘cause I took a CPR class when the baby was learning to swim. Just for the record, I want it noted: not for a second did I even think about letting him choke to death, even though it would’ve saved me an awful lot of headaches.
Donnie still isn’t breathing. Jordan flips him over, tries the Heimlich -- we hear a CRUNCH as he breaks Donnie’s ribs. He flips him back over, but he’s almost completely blue.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	103.

JORDAN He won’t come back!
NAOMI
Don’t let him die! He has children!
One last try. Jordan takes a massive breath, blowing as hard as he can into Donnie’s lungs. Donnie’s stomach distends like a balloon, then suddenly a chunk of ham projects from his mouth and into Jordan’s face. Donnie coughs, vomiting. And as he starts breathing again,
Jordan exits and passes out on the living room couch.	*
FADE TO BLACK.
BROOKVILLE POLICE #1 (V.O.) Jordan Belfort?

Wow. Maybe I hadn’t made it home okay.

201	EXT. HEGEMAN’S ROAD - NIGHT (LATE SUMMER ‘95)	201
FLASHBACK. Nodding out, Jordan drives the Lamborghini like a maniac, careening off parked cars and trees.
JORDAN (V.O.) It was an absolute miracle I

A MAN steps up to get his mug shot taken, but it’s Brad, not Jordan. FLASH. Turn to the side. FLASH.
JORDAN (V.O.)
But they couldn’t arrest me, the cops had no proof I’d been behind
the wheel. Meanwhile, Brad did a	* few months in jail for contempt	* because he wouldn’t rat Donnie
out. They never found his gun, though, so they finally had to let him go.

Jordan watches an INSTRUCTOR lead Skylar on a pony. Nearby Naomi holds newborn PARKER. Manny Riskin and Max stand beside Jordan.
MANNY RISKIN You’re a lucky guy, Jordan. Legally I’ve never seen anyone slip a noose the way you do. Christ, you’re lucky to be alive much less not in jail.
JORDAN
I don’t believe in luck.
MANNY RISKIN That’s what all lucky people say. It’s time, Jordan. Let me make a deal with SEC. Before your luck runs out.
Skylar waves from the pony and Jordan waves back.
JORDAN What kind of terms?
MANNY RISKIN
You plead guilty to a handful of securities violations -- stock manipulation, high pressure sales tactics, ticky-tack shit like that. You pay a few million dollars in fines and in exchange the SEC fucks off for all time.
JORDAN
And Stratton? What happens there?
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	105.

MANNY RISKIN You’d have to walk away. Let Donnie take over.
(that one hurts)
Now the FBI’s a different animal. They can still pursue you for criminal wrongdoing. But with you on the sidelines, my guess is your best friend Agent Denham’ll be left standing around with his dick in his hand.
Jordan digests that.
MAX
You beat them, Jordan. You won. Sail into the sunset with your wife and kids while you can.
MANNY RISKIN God knows you’ll never have to work again.
As Jordan looks at his picture-perfect family, WE HEAR THE ROAR OF A CROWD...
202C	SCENES 202C - 202D OMITTED	202C

202E	INT. STRATTON OAKMONT III - BULLPEN - DAY	202E (SPRING ‘96)
The troops ROAR as Jordan takes center stage.
JORDAN
I’m sure many of you have been hearing rumors lately, about me, about the future of this firm, and that’s what I’d like to talk to you about today.
(a few beats, then) Five years ago when I started
Stratton with Donnie Azoff, I knew the day would eventually come when I’d be moving on. It’s truly with a heavy heart that I tell you that day is here.
The place erupts in a chorus of “No!”, “Don’t go!”, etc. Jordan raises his hand for quiet.
JORDAN (CONT’D) Thank you for that and for your years of incredible loyalty and admiration.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	106.
JORDAN (CONT’D) The point is though, that under Donnie’s leadership, along with Robbie Feinberg and Nicky Koskoff moving into key management positions, this place is gonna be better than ever!
A smattering of applause. Jordan notices a few Brokers gravely shaking their heads.
JORDAN (CONT’D) And the fact that I'm gone won’t
stop me from giving Donnie advice, not that he needs any--
DONNIE (jumping in)
Why would anyone in their right mind not follow JB's advice?
Donnie looks petrified; he’s used to being an offensive tackle, not the quarterback.
JORDAN
Before I go, there’s something I want to remind you all, and that’s this -- Stratton Oakmont is bigger than any one person, even me. Especially me. You guys are Stratton, each and every one of you, and that is why it’s sure to remain the best brokerage firm in the fucking world!
Thunderous applause spreads through the boardroom, all 300 Brokers on their feet. WE PUSH IN on Jordan.
JORDAN (CONT’D) See, the very idea of Stratton is that when you come here and step into this bullpen for the first time, you start your life anew. You have a place here and no one can take that away from you! Stratton Oakmont is America! Give me your tired and poor! The very moment you walk through that door and pledge your loyalty to this firm, you become part of a family, you become a Strattonite! It doesn’t matter who you are, it doesn’t matter where you’re from! Whether your family came over on the Mayflower or on a fucking inner tube from Haiti!
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	107.

More applause. Jordan scans the young faces -- they worship him. In the crowd he finds KIMMIE BELZER, 30s.
JORDAN (CONT’D) Everybody here knows Kimmie Belzer, right?
Hoots and hollers... He raises his hand for quiet.
JORDAN (CONT’D) In case any of you weren't aware of it, Kimmie was one of Stratton's first brokers, one of the original twenty. Now when most of you met Kimmie, you met her the way she is today -- a
beautiful woman who drives a brand new Mercedes, a woman who lives in the finest condo complex on Long Island. A woman who wears $3000 Armani suits, who spends her winters in the Bahamas and her summers in the Hamptons!
Wild applause.
JORDAN (CONT’D) But that’s not the Kimmie I met. The Kimmie I met was broke, a single mom on the balls of her ass. Three months behind on her rent with an eight year old son! She came to me for a job and when I hired her she asked for a $5000 dollar advance so she could pay his tuition. And what did I do, Kimmie?
KIMMIE
You wrote me a check for $25,000!
JORDAN
Because I believed in you, like I believe in each and every one of you!
KIMMIE I love you, Jordan!
As the Brokers go berserk, Jordan stands basking in the adoration. He looks at Donnie, turns back to the Crowd, looks out at the faces. A change has come over him.
He stands there, thinking. An eternity, then:
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	108.

JORDAN
You know for years I’ve been telling you guys not to take no for an answer, to keep pushing, to not hang up the phone till you get what you want. This deal I’m about to sign, barring me from the securities industry, barring me from Stratton, my home... What the fuck is that? I’ll tell you what it is, it’s me being a hypocrite. It’s me taking no for an answer, it’s them selling me, not the other way around! Fuck it, I’m not leaving!
Jordan smiles, thrusts his hands in the air --

The place goes absolutely INSANE. And as Donnie and Max trade looks, TECHNO MUSIC BLASTS taking us to...

I have a rare condition that requires me to drink one of these every fifteen minutes. If you could set your egg timer, I’d appreciate it.

SAUREL (a sly grin)
Well. Not as of yet.

JORDAN (V.O.) The nice thing about getting rescued by Italians is that the first thing they do is feed you and make you drink red wine. Then they make you dance.
Jordan watches as the dancing continues, then casually glances out a porthole, where WE SEE the distant lights of a PLANE making its way across the night sky. After a few beats, the plane EXPLODES, a tiny flash of light.
JORDAN (V.O.) Did you see that? That was the
plane I sent for to come get us. I shit you not, it exploded when a seagull flew into the engine, three people killed. You want a sign from God, well after all this I finally got the message. I had to make some fucking changes.

218	INT. CENTRAL BOOKING - QUEENS - NIGHT (SEP ‘98)	218
CLOSE ON JORDAN’S HANDS, at last in cuffs. PAN UP TO HIM, looking none-too-pleased.
JORDAN (V.O.) This one takes the cake. It was Rugrat, he’d been busted down in Miami, and guess who the fuck with?

219	EXT. MIAMI RESTAURANT - NIGHT (SEP ‘98)	219
Jean-Jacques Saurel is handcuffed by Feds as Rugrat looks on crying, handcuffed nearby.
JORDAN (V.O.)
What were the odds? There had to be ten thousand Swiss bankers in Geneva and I choose the one dumb enough to get himself arrested on U.S. soil.

220	INT. MIAMI FBI OFFICE - NIGHT (SEP ‘98)	220
CLICK! Saurel gets his mug shot taken.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	121.

JORDAN (V.O.) Even more ironic was he'd gotten himself indicted on charges that
had nothing to fucking do with me.

221	EXT. MIAMI MANSION - NIGHT (SEP ‘98)	221
ROCKY AOKI, Japanese, 50s, is led out in handcuffs by a MAN in an FBI windbreaker.
JORDAN (V.O.) Something about laundering drug money through offshore boat racing and a guy named Rocky Aoki, the founder of Benihana.
221A	INSERT BENI HANA COMMERCIAL --	221A
A smiling Rocky Aoki looks on as a HIBACHI CHEF expertly dices shrimp on a sizzling grill.
JORDAN (V.O.)
Beni-fucking-hana! Why would God be so cruel as to choose a chain of fucking Hibachi Restaurants to bring me down?

222	INT. SAUREL’S BEDROOM - DAY (OCT ‘95)	222
Saurel lays on the bed, smoking.
JORDAN (V.O.)
Long story short was Saurel ratted me out, but not before he ratted out Chantalle, who it turns out he’d been fucking every time she went to Switzerland!
Chantalle emerges from the bathroom naked. Laughing, she runs and jumps in bed with Saurel.

223	INT. FEDERAL COURT - QUEENS - DAY (SEP ‘98)	223
With his criminal attorney NOLAN DRAGER, 40s, next to him, Jordan stands before a JUDGE, being arraigned.

NOLAN DRAGER	* This is...well, it’s not good.	* It’s pretty bad actually. How	* much money do you have, Jordan?	*
JORDAN	* I can make bail.	*
NOLAN DRAGER	* I don’t mean the ten million, I	* mean for legal fees. Cuz if you	* want to fight this thing, it’s	* gonna be expensive. Like, sell-	* everything-you-own-expensive.	*

224	EXT. U.S. ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - DAY (SEP ‘98)	*224
Jordan exits the building. He’s fucked and he knows it. He sees beautiful Naomi waiting for him beside a limosine; life isn’t totally hopeless. He approaches.
JORDAN
Nay, thank God. I’m so glad you’re here.
They embrace. He can’t see her expression: she’d rather be anywhere else.

226	EXT. JORDAN’S ESTATE - POOL AREA - DAY (SEP ‘98)	226
ON SKYLAR AND PARKER, playing with a NANNY and Rocky the dog. Jordan watches them, sitting by his pool, drinking an O’Douls, weighing his options.
Donnie pops into the yard, in “Uncle Donnie” mode.
DONNIE
Hey, everybody! How’re the happiest people in Long Island? Hi, Rocky!!
(joining Jordan) Hate that fucking dog.
JORDAN
Tell me about it. It’s getting old, starting to shit inside the house again.
Jordan offers Donnie an O’Douls; Donnie declines.
DONNIE How you doing, brother? the food in jail?
JORDAN Lobster Newburg sucked. me some jewelry though.
How was

They gave
He shows off the electronic bracelet around his ankle.
DONNIE
Wonder if they got one in my size. Fuckin’ Rugrat, that wig-wearin’ hump. Tell you one thing: I’m never eating at Benihana’s again. Where’s Naomi?
JORDAN Inside. Pissed.
Donnie sees Naomi in a window. He waves but she barely registers him.
DONNIE What’s up her ass?
JORDAN
Had to mortgage the home to make bail. Probably gonna hafta sell it to pay my lawyers. If we fight this thing.
Donnie weighs that.
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	124.

DONNIE
The Feds say anything about coming after the rest of us?
Jordan thinks, then shakes his head no.
DONNIE (CONT’D) You know, we’re all behind you. Everyone at the office.
(he removes an envelope, hands it to Jordan)
We bought back your mortgage. All the founding partners threw in a million apiece. Figured none of us would have it if it weren’t for you.
Jordan’s profoundly touched. Donnie squeezes his shoulder. A real moment of friendship.
DONNIE (CONT’D) You gotta fight this thing, baby.
Jordan nods.
JORDAN (V.O.) Like I said, loyalty meant a lot to me. Without your friends and
family standing behind you, you’re fucked.

Jordan sits with Nolan Drager across from FBI Agent	* Denham, U.S. Attorney LUCAS SOLOMON, 50s, and Assistant	* U.S. Attorney ROCHELLE APPLEBAUM, 30s, humorless.	*
LUCAS SOLOMON	* There’s a term we have around	* here, we don’t like to use it	* often, only when circumstances	* dictate. It’s called a “Grenada.”	* Inspired by our government’s	* invasion in 1983 of the island	* nation of only 90,000 people,	* basically it stands for any case	* we get which is pretty much unlose-	* able. We could show up late and	* drunk to court, fuck up left-right-	* and-center and still we’d win.	* Mr. Belfort, you, sir, are a	* “Grenada.”	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	125.

ROCHELLE APPLEBAUM	* You’re looking at real prison	* time. Money laundering gets you	* as much as 20 years. Case	* couldn’t be stronger if we’d have	* caught you with your cash in your	* mattress.	*
Solomon pushes a box full of evidence across the table.	* Jordan eyeballs Denham.	*
LUCAS SOLOMON	* Read the discovery.	*
JORDAN	* That your life’s work in the box?	*
AGENT DENHAM	* Jordan, you rotting in jail til	* your kids’re outta college isn’t	* our ambition here. You weren’t	* the only one involved in all this.	* We think those folks deserve their	* day in court too.	*
NOLAN DRAGER	* Why do I get the sense there’s an
offer in the air? If so, let’s	* put it on the table.	*
LUCAS SOLOMON
Full cooperation. A comprehensive list of all coconspirators spanning the last seven years and he agrees to wear a wire.
JORDAN You want me to rat?
LUCAS SOLOMON	* We want your cooperation in --	*
AGENT DENHAM	* Yes. We want you to rat.	*

NAOMI	* It was fine.	*
The Wolf of Wall Street Buff Revised Pages	3/5/13	126.

JORDAN	* Baby, I talked to the lawyers	* again today. I have some really	* great news. As it turns out you’re	* totally off the hook.	*
NAOMI	* I know that already.	*
JORDAN	* You never did anything wrong	* anyway, right? At the end of the	* day all they really want is for me	* to cooperate - that’s it.	* See, apparently, I know so much	* about what’s going on in the stock	* market that I could save the	* government years of heartache. But	* it get’s even better... You see,	* if I cooperate I’ll only have to	* serve four short years and any	* fine I’d have to pay wouldn’t be	* due til after I serve my sentence.	* We’ll still have plenty of money	* left over.

NAOMI	* Like you said, “There’s no friends	* on Wall Street”.	*
JORDAN	* But there’s a silver lining to	* that too... It turns out that all	* of ‘em are probably gonna	* cooperate too. So in the end, that	* won’t really be a factor.	*
NAOMI	* Well, that’s really good news,	* honey. I’m really happy for you.	*
JORDAN	* No, it’s good for both of us, Nay.	*
NAOMI	* Yeah, yeah.	*

TIME CUT: Jordan is fucking Naomi. It’s the best he’s	* felt in days. While he’s lost in it, she’s lost interest, * going through the motions perfunctorily.	*
JORDAN	* I love you, Nay. I love you so	* much. I’ve loved you from the	* first time I saw you.	*
NAOMI	* Fuck you.	*
That stops him.	*
JORDAN	* What?	*
NAOMI	* I fucking hate you.	*
JORDAN	* What are you talking about?	*

JORDAN	* That’s not true. What do you mean?	*
NAOMI	* You wanna fuck me? Fine. Fuck me	* hard like it’s the last time.	*
JORDAN	* Hold still. Why are you moving	* like that?	*

Naomi gets up.	*

NAOMI	* Yes, that’s right.	*
JORDAN	* What kind of a person are you?	*
NAOMI	* You married me. This is how it’s	* gonna be. Listen Jordan. I’m	* taking custody of the kids. If you	* agree to the divorce right now, I	* will allow you visitation. Don’t	* try to fight it. It will save us	* both a lot of money and I have a	* feeling you’re gonna need it.	*

And as Jordan heaves a huge sigh, we’re suddenly...

Whatever you need, bro. You know that.
Jordan reaches in his jacket for a yellow slip of PAPER.
JORDAN
And you know how much that means to me. Hey, you know what I wanted to ask you?
Jordan catches Donnie’s eye, pushes the PAPER over in front of him.
JORDAN (CONT’D) The Steve Madden deal, did he ever come through on that?
Donnie looks down at the paper, reads Jordan’s writing:
“DON’T INCRIMINATE YOURSELF. I’M WEARING A WIRE.”
JORDAN (CONT’D) Remember he was supposed to kick back like four mil from that one account?
DONNIE
Uh... tell you the truth I was so fucked up, I don’t really remember anything about that.
Donnie slips the paper in his jacket, gives Jordan a look -- “Thank you.” Jordan nods.
JORDAN
Well if you talk to him, let me know. You want the last yellowtail?
DONNIE Why not?

Hihi, good job

Begon met F, gooi die twintig kop en ik was verkocht
Kijk, ze rennen met dertig man
Als ik terugkijk ja, dan ben ik trots
Bro je liet je mattie alleen
Rende voor die wap werd getrokken
Die shit zit niet in je systeem
Speel het niet, want je bent een gay
Chat de hele dag op die snapchat
Zie die libie niet als een game
Chat de helе dag op die snapchat
Zie die libiе niet als een game
En iedereen die mag komen
Extra waps, draco's en Glocks
Ik doop mezelf bij de duivel, maar ik heb me ziel niet verkocht
Sta op!, bun up de place en ga los
Maak die hele kankerstraat chaos
Bun up de place en ga los
Maak die hele kankerstraat chaos
Twee-vier dashy, Blacka die was d'r echt niet
Heel Icy was aan het rennen
Een sukkel als Chuloo, het boeit 'm echt niet
En eigenlijk had ik gehoopt dat (..) dood was, maar dat was niet zo
En eigenlijk had ik gehoopt dat (..) dood was, maar dat was niet zo
Je wordt ge-Johnwicked, ik blaas niet op D, gezicht
Don't get smoked voor je lijkt op mist
Cause bank and be like us
Kijk uit voor ik bullets spuug
Bro kijk uit voor ik bullets boss!
Ja, die muziek dat euhh
Ik weet niet precies hoe het heet ook, drill?
Het is allemaal heel donker en dubieus
En daarmee trek je dus allerlei donkere krachten aan
Dus dat schiet niet op, dus je moet echte muziek gaan maken
Dit niveau is gewoon... - nee, sorry
Ja, daar zit de hele wereld vol...

Zijn on the road en zoeken naar bills
Jongens gaan dood hier, de straten zijn kil
De punt die we pakte maakt other side stil
Ze rijden niet echt, maar toch maken ze drill
Gas neem ik terug, als het real wordt in field
Krijg les in de velden met wap, ik heb skills
Daden geen fictie, ik speel geen toneel
Ze stellen niks, voor al je punten; nihil
Je face op een shirt als ik mik op je huid
Vol magazijn leeg ik uit als een puist
Die opp loopt gevaar als hij hier loopt in Zuid
Een killersysteem en ik schakel hem uit
Die wap is m'n vrouw, ben getrouwd als een bruid
Gadgets zijn handig, ga niet op de vuist
M'n Glocks die zijn clean voor ik tooly gebruik
M'n Glocks die zijn clean voor ik tooly gebruik
Stackz heeft het al gezegd
War is war, zelfs Q moet dead
En Blacka heeft grote bek
Maar ziet hij m'n members dan rent hij weg
Yo, Zim, Zim, Zimma who got the keys to the bimma
Shh zet kankerherres op Skiffa
Shh zet kankerherres op Skiffa
Yo en dat is een feit
Chuloo wou beef ik wil dat hij rijd
Glock op mij we blazen gelijk
Heb tien in die clip alles hier gaat kwijt
Yo twee-vier is safe, don't believe the fucking hype
Voel me net Choppa, ik John net Whick
Wacht op plek met een grote stick"

Alam mo bang hinahanap kita araw araw
Gabi gabi ako'y hindi mapakali
Inaalala ko ang mga bawat sandali
Ano ang dahilan bakit ka nag ka ganyan
Ang sabi sakin may nakakita sayo sa daan
May kasama kang iba't kayo ay masaya
Ako'y nagtataka at ako ay nabigla

Bakit kailangan mo pang pahabain
Kung tayo ay mag tatapos na rin
Bakit kailangan mo pang magtago
Kung tayo ay andito na sa dulo
Di naman kita pipigilan
Hindi na rin kita kailangan

Kasalanan mo eto
Kung Bakit nagkaganito
Lahat ay ginawa para makasama ka
Ano bang nangyare sa iyo
Hangga’t nandyadyan ka pa
Palibasa mahal pa kita
Bakit di mo maranasan kung gano talaga kasakit ng puso kong eto
Makinig ka na saakin
Hanap ko’y bakit
Aminin mo saakin kung anong naplano mo para masira yung relasyon natin
Bakit ba ako?
Bakit di nalang sayo
Sawa na talaga ako sa mga sinasabi mo
Ano bang nangyare saatin dalawa
Kahapon ay kasama lang kita
Bakit ngayon ay meron ka na agad iba
Ang sakit na talaga puta lumayo kana

Bakit kailangan mo pang pahabain

Bakit kailangan mo pang magtago
Kung tayo ay andito na sa dulo

Hindi na rin kita kailangan

Ayoko na muling
Kulitin ka pa na mahalin
Alam ko naman na hindi mo na din
Kailangan pa ang mga yakap ko sayo't lambing
Palaging binabalewala
Mo nalang kala mo ba ay nakakatuwa
Umabot na sa punto na ako ay sagarin
Bumitaw ng tuluyang manawa
Hindi ka siguro natuto
Kaya ako ay inabuso
Sagad na sa labis na pagmamahal ko sayo'y
Na punta na sa dulo

Bakit kailangan mo pang pahabain

Bakit kailangan mo pang magtago

Na di kayang tumbasan ng kahit na ano mang materyal

Dati nasa panaginip lang ang binibini na
Naging rason ng kada gising ko sa umaga
Kung magmahal kakalangita'y nagiging kama
Parang gabi-gabi kung makasiping ko si darna
Pag ika'y kayakap mas lalo kong nalalaman
Ang ibig sabihin ng kayamanan
Kahit na halaga man ng pambayad upa sa aming tahanan
Ay presyo lang ng nasa mesa nila tuwing agahan
Bagong telepono, magara na sapatusan
Ayun ay ‘di ko maibibigay ang iyong layaw
Pagkat ang kaya ko lang ay ipadama sayo
Na laging ikalabing apat ng Pebrero kada araw

Na dalawin kaso baka kumot mo'y nasa labahan pa
Wag kang mag-alala sa aking kalagayan
Sa ngayon ay kaya ko ng ibigay sa'yo ang kalawakan
Habang nakahiga't magkahawak ang kamay
Labi mo'y tanging sa pisngi ko lang nakalagay
Tawanan hanggang sa mag-umaga
Mapa kahirapan ay kasama mo akong umaray
Katabi ka hanggang sa kayamanan malulong
Mga bagay na sana nagawa pa natin noon
Kung ‘di ako makatulog na nagmamaneho't gisingin

Magdalena, ano'ng problema
Alam naman natin na dati kang nena
At sa iyong ama ikaw ay prinsesa
Ano'ng nangyari sa'yo?
Ito'y kwento ng isang babaeng
Tulog sa umaga, gising sa gabi
Ang kanyang mukha'y puno ng kolorete
Sa lugar na ang ilaw ay patay sindi
Simulan na natin ang istorya

Ako'y kanyang matalik na kaibigan, Ernesto ang aking pangalan
Kwentong dapat ‘nyong malaman, ‘wag nang magbulag bulagan
Bakit ang nais natin ay malaman ang baho ng iba?
Pagbibigyan kita, kilala mo ba si Magda?
Na aking kababata mula pa ng pagkabata
Kami lagi magkasama mga bangkang papel sa sapa
Kanyang ngiti lumiliwanag ang paligid
At pag siya'y dumadaan mga leeg ay pumipilipit
Ubod ng ganda noong siya ay nagdalaga
Tuwing kausap ko na malimit akong tulala
Kahit may nararamdaman pinilit kong isara
Ang bibig at pintig ng puso sa kanya
At sa sayawan matapos kaming makapagtapos
Dahil pinawis ang mukha ako'y nagpunas ng pulbos
Kahit parang hindi pantay ay nagmamadaling hinila

Maraming taon ako'y nalipasan, pinilit ko mang takasan
Bagkus ay aking nalaman ang tunay kong kailangan
‘Di ko maibaling ang pagtingin ko sa iba
Minamahal ko s'ya, hahanapin ko si Magda
Lumuwas habang nagdarasal na maabutan
Sa lugar na ang sabi'y kanyang pinagtatrabahuhan
Nakita ko'ng larawan niya na nakadikit sa pintuan
Iba man ang kulay ng buhok ‘di ko malilimutan
Ang kanyang mata at tamis ng kanyang ngiti
At dahil ubod ng saya hindi na nag atubili
Agad pumasok sa silid pero bakit ang dilim
Madaming lamesa't mga nag-iinumang lasing
Nang biglang nagpalakpakan may mabagal na kanta
Sa maliit na entablado ay nakita ko na
Ako ay nagtaka, nagtanong, nagkamot:
Bakit s'ya sumasayaw na sapatos lang ang suot?

Ito'y kwento ng isang babaeng
Tulog sa umaga, gising sa gabi
Ang kanyang mukha'y puno ng kolorete
Sa lugar na ang ilaw ay patay sindi
Ituloy natin ang istorya

Agad siyang sumama sa'kin walang kakabakaba
Ang trato niya sa'kin ay nobyo tila katakataka
Bumaba sa taxi-ng pinara sa Sta. Mesa
Parang ako'y bida sa mga sumunod na eksena
Kung ito ay panaginip ayoko nang magising
Ngunit ako'y nanaginip umaga na nang magising
Ang naabutan ko lamang ay may sobre sa lapag
Liham para sa'kin na isinulat niya magdamag
Kahit gulong gulo ang isip pinilit kong basahin
‘Di malilimutan ang mga sinabi niya sa akin

Mahal kong Ernesto, alam kong tulog mo'y malalim
‘Di na ‘ko nagpaalam ‘di na kita ginising
Salamat nga pala sa pasalubong mong kalamay
At sa pinakamasayang gabi ng aking buhay
Nung iniwan ko ang baryo natin ang akala ko
Isang tunay na pag-ibig ang matatagpuan ko
Hinanap kung saan-saan at kung kani-kanino
‘Di ko inakalang ito ang kahahantungan ko
Imbis na ako'y sagipin itinulak sa bangin
Ito pala'ng ibig sabihin ng kapit sa patalim
Kung mabaho sabunin, kung makati gamutin
Kung hindi na masikmura ay ibaling ang tingin
Kahit ako ay bayaran at kaladkaring babaeng
Alam ang amoy ng laway ng iba't-ibang lalaki
Isa lang ang kaya kong sayo'y maipagmalaki:
Ikaw lang ang bukod tanging hinalikan ko sa labi
Gusto ko mang manatili sa'yong mga yakap
Ako may natutuwa dahil ako'y iyong nahanap
Wala na yatang walis ang makakalinis ng kalat
At ang katulad ko sa'yo ay ‘di karapat-dapat
Pinangarap kong sa altar ako'y iyong ihatid
Ngunit sa dami ng pait, ang puso ko'y namanhid
‘Di ko makakalimutan ang pabaon mong halik
Pero pakiusap huwag ka na sana pang babalik
Regalo ng Maykapal ang ikaw ay makilala
Salamat sa ala-ala

April 6, 2016
To the equity partners of Philadelphia 76ers, L.P.:
I hope this letter finds you well. I have been serving the Sixers at your pleasure for the past 34 months. Atul Gawande, a Surgeon at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, remains (from afar) one of my favorite reads. He laughs that reading scientific studies has long been a guilty pleasure. Reading investor letters has long been one of mine.
What I hope to accomplish here is to give you insight into what has transpired behind the scenes in ways you might not have otherwise heard about. Many of you attended our most recent board meeting in New York, where many of these topics were addressed. But for all twelve of you, I hope that this provides a deeper look into what you have at your organization. Accordingly, you should anticipate some mild cheerleading (of others) sprinkled with a healthy dose of self-flagellation about things I’ve done wrong.
There has been much criticism of our approach. There will be more. A competitive league like the NBA necessitates a zig while our competitors comfortably zag. We often chose not to defend ourselves against much of the criticism, largely in an effort to stay true to the ideal of having the longest view in the room. To attempt to convince others that our actions are just will serve to paint us in a different light among some of our competitors as progressives worth emulating, versus adversaries worthy of their disdain. Call me old-fashioned, but sometimes the optimal place for your light is hiding directly under a bushel.
Lastly, this letter will only speak to the part of the business that I’m today’s steward of: the basketball team and its attendant operations. With Scott O’Neil running our business operations, you are in good hands. I can assure you that when your team is eventually able to compete deep into May, Scott will ably and efficiently separate the good people of the Delaware Valley from their wallets on your behalf.
Worry not.
A league with 30 intense competitors requires a culture of finding new, better ways to solve repeating problems. In the short term, investing in that sort of innovation often doesn’t look like much progress, if any. Abraham Lincoln said “give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.”
In May of 1969, a 38-year-old Warren Buffett sat down at a typewriter to inform his investors that he was closing his fund (then Buffett Partnership). His reason: market conditions were such that he no longer had the requisite confidence that he could make good decisions on behalf of the investors and deliver on his commitments to them. So he would stop investing on their behalf.
For me, that’s today. Given all the changes to our organization, I no longer have the confidence that I can make good decisions on behalf of investors in the Sixers—you. So I should step down. And I have.
In one sense, it pains me that it has come to this and that I would go at the end of a particularly down year in the standings, one that has been painful for all of us. But the fact is—and a young Buffett said it much better than I ever could—“I am not attuned to this environment, and I don’t want to spoil a decent record by trying to play a game I don’t understand just so I can go out a hero.”
Yup.
Thinking about thinking
I admire Seth Klarman a great deal. I am consistently impressed by his conviction and humility, a rare combination. About their approach at Baupost, he says, “it isn’t the only way of thinking, but it’s how we approach it.” Below is some insight into a few things we value and how we’ve approached decision making at the Sixers.
First, this list is anything but exhaustive, and hardly mine alone. Whenever possible, I think crosspollinating ideas from other contexts is far, far better than attempting to solve our problems in basketball as if no one has ever faced anything similar. Accordingly, this approach comes from a frequent search into behavioral economics, cognitive science, and a lot of observation and trial and error over my 11 years in the NBA. And mistakes. Lots and lots of mistakes.
To begin, let’s stand on the shoulders of Charlie Munger, a giant to me. He is a man that’s been thinking about thinking longer than I’ve been alive. Let’s start with him and his approach. His two-part technique is:
1. First, what are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered?
2. Second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically doing these things—which by and large are useful, but which often malfunctions?
To do this requires you to divorce process from outcome. You can be right for the wrong reasons. In our business, you’re often lionized for it. You can be wrong for the right reasons. This may well prove to be Joel Embiid. There is signal everywhere that Joel is unique, from the practice gyms in Lawrence, Kansas to Bala Cynwyd, Pennsylvania to Doha, Qatar where he does something awe inspiring far too regularly. We remain hopeful (and optimistic) about his long-term playing career, but we don’t yet know exactly how it will turn out. The decision to draft Joel third, though, still looks to me to be the correct one in hindsight given the underlying reasoning. But to call something that could be wrong (“failed draft pick”) right (“good decision”) makes all of our heads hurt, mine included.
So we have to look deeper at process. Here’s a go at it:
(I would be dismayed if you don’t see pockets of this kind of thinking throughout the organization. In fact, I will feel like I’ve let you down.)
The importance of intellectual humility
Lifelong learning is where it’s at. To walk down that path requires a deep-seated humility about a) what’s knowable, and b) what each of us know. We hire for this aggressively. We celebrate this internally. And we’ve been known to punish when we find it woefully lacking.
We talk a great deal about being curious, not critical. About asking the question until you understand something truly. About not being afraid to ask the obvious question that everyone else seems to know the answer to. And about the willingness to say three simple words, “I don’t know.”
Tesla’s Elon Musk describes his everyday stance as, “You should take the approach that you’re wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.” The physicist James Clerk Maxwell described it as a “thoroughly conscious ignorance—the prelude to every real advance in science.” Bill James of the Boston Red Sox (and, I might add, a Kansas basketball expert) added a little flair when asked whether the learnings available via examining evidence were exhausted: “we’ve only taken a bucket of knowledge from a sea of ignorance.”
A way to prop up this kind of humility is to keep score. Use a decision journal. Write in your own words what you think will happen and why before a decision. Refer back to it later. See if you were right, and for the right reasons (think Bill Belichick’s famous 4th down decision against Indianapolis in 2009 which summarizes to: good decision, didn’t work). Reading your own past reasoning in your own words in your own handwriting time after time causes the tides of humility to gather at your feet. I’m often in waist-deep water here.
The other reason to keep track yourself is you’re often the only one to see the most insidious type of errors, the ones the narrative generating parts of our lizard brains storytell their way around—errors of omission. You don’t have a wobbly understanding of just the things you got wrong, but the things you got right but not right enough. Listen to Charlie Munger talk about how he and Berkshire Hathaway should be measured not by their success, but by how much more successful they would have been if they bought more of something: “We should have bought more Coke.”
The necessity of innovation
Investing in disruptive innovation doesn’t ferment misunderstanding, it necessitates it. Jeff Bezos says it this way: “There are a few prerequisites to inventing…You have to be willing to fail. You have to be willing to think long-term. You have to be willing to be misunderstood for long periods of time.”
A yearning for innovation requires real exploration. It requires a persistent search to try (and fail) to move your understanding forward with a new tool, a new technique, a new insight. Sadly, the first innovation often isn’t even all that helpful, but may well provide a path to ones that are. This is an idea that Steven Johnson of Where Good Ideas Come From popularized called the “adjacent possible.” Where finding your way through a labyrinth of ignorance requires you to first open a door into a room of understanding, one that by its very existence has new doors to new rooms with deeper insights lurking behind them.
In most endeavors, it’s fine to be content to woodshed until you get something near perfect. You want that to be you. Grit matters. But it won’t be long until some innovation makes all that effort newly obsolete. You want that to be you, too.The longest view in the room
It is critical to be cycle aware in a talent-driven league. In a situation like yours at the Sixers, where a variety of circumstances left you near a trough in the cycle (and falling), amplifying this cycle became crucial. Today’s outcomes for every team are heavily impacted by decisions past (who to draft, sign, trade, hire, etc.). Jeff Bezos says that if Amazon has a good quarter it’s because of work they did 3, 4, 5 years ago—not because they did a good job that quarter. Today’s league-leading Golden State Warriors acquired Draymond Green, Andrew Bogut, and Klay Thompson almost 4 years ago, nearly 4 years ago exactly, and almost 5 years ago. In this league, the long view picks at the lock of mediocrity.
While some organizations (like ours) have this as part of their ethos, for others it is the ethos. Check out the 10,000 Year Clock. It is no mere thought experiment, but an actual clock being designed to be placed inside a mountain in West Texas, wound, and left to tick and chime for ten thousand years. Why? Because to design something that lasts that long makes us all consider what the world will look like between now and then. In return, we might be inspired to do something about it.
More practically, to take the long view has an unintuitive advantage built in—fewer competitors.
Here’s Warren Buffett in the late 80s on this topic: “In any sort of a contest—financial, mental, or physical—it’s an enormous advantage to have opponents who have been taught that it's useless to even try.”
Ask who wants to trade for an in-his-prime Kevin Garnett and 30 hands will go up. Ask who planned for it three or four years in advance and Danny Ainge is nearly alone. Same for Daryl Morey in Houston trading for James Harden. San Antonio’s Peter Holt said after signing LaMarcus Aldridge this summer, “R.C.  came to us with this plan three years ago, four years ago—seriously. And we’ve worked at it ever since.”A contrarian mindset
This one is tricky, and getting more so in a league as healthy and popular as the NBA that is covered by beat writers, columnists, bloggers, commentators, and fans minute-to-minute. If you want to have real success you have to very often be willing to do something different from the herd.
A few examples might help. Step away from basketball and imagine for a moment this is investment management, and your job is to take your client’s money and make it grow. It’s January 1, 2015 and the S&P 500 is $171.60, exactly the same price it has been since January 1, 1985. No fluctuation up or down. Flat every single day. And your job for every day of the past 30 years is to make money for your clients by investing. What would you do?
In the NBA, that’s wins. The same 82 games are up for grabs every year for every team. Just like in 1985 (or before). To get more wins, you’re going to have to take them from someone else. Wins are a zero-growth industry (how many of you regularly choose to invest in those?), and the only way up is to steal share from your competitors. You will have to do something different. You will have to be contrarian.
Howard Marks describes this as a necessary condition of great performance: you have to be nonconsensus and right. Both. That means you have to find some way to have a differentiated viewpoint from the masses. And it needs to be right. Anything less won’t work.
But this is difficult, emotionally and intellectually. Seth Klarman talks about the comfort of consensus. It’s much more comfortable to have people generally agreeing with you. By definition, those opportunities in a constrained environment winnow away with each person that agrees with you, though. It reminds me of when we first moved to Palo Alto. Within about a week of living there a voice kept telling me, “This is great. Great weather, 30 minutes to the ocean, 3 hours to ski, a vibrant city 30 miles away, and one of the world’s best research universities within walking distance. People should really move here.” Then I looked at real estate prices. I was right, yes, but this view was decidedly not a non-consensus view. My viewpoint as a Silicon Valley real estate dilettante, which took a whole week to form, had been priced in. Shocker.
To develop truly contrarian views will require a never-ending thirst for better, more diverse inputs.
What player do you think is most undervalued? Get him for your team. What basketball axiom is most likely to be untrue? Take it on and do the opposite. What is the biggest, least valuable time sink for the organization? Stop doing it. Otherwise, it’s a big game of pitty pat, and you’re stuck just hoping for good things to happen, rather than developing a strategy for how to make them happen.
There has to be a willingness to tolerate counterarguments, hopefully in such a way that you can truly understand and summarize the other side’s arguments at least as well as they can. And then, after all that, still have the conviction to separate yourself from the herd.A tolerance of uncertainty
This one can be really difficult, especially when the stakes are high. But it’s critical to making rational decisions over the long term. We are all so tempted to simplify when something is hard to think about, simply to get it out of our mind by treating it as impossible.
This goes from academic sounding to life altering in basketball team building, though. Looking at a player with an estimated 10% or 20% chance of being a star over the next three or four years can’t be written to zero—that’s about as high as those odds ever get. That’s surely a very, very high number for any player that is ever available to you to be added to your team. Once you accept that, it becomes clear that shrinking the confidence interval around that estimate (and the estimates of the downside risk at the other end of the spectrum) becomes pretty darn important.
But our well worn thinking patterns often let us down here. Phil Tetlock, from just down the street at Penn, addresses this well in his most recent remarkable book Superforecasting where he quotes the great Amos Tversky saying, “In dealing with probabilities…most people only have three settings: “gonna happen,” “not gonna happen,” and “maybe”.” Jeff Van Gundy sums it up succinctly on our telecasts, “it’s a make or miss league.” He’s right.
In some decisions, the uncertainties are savage. You have to find a way to get comfortable with that range of outcomes. If you can’t, you’re forced to live with many fewer options to choose amongst which leads over the long term to lesser and lesser outcomes.
The illusion of control is an opiate, though. Nonetheless, it is annoyingly necessary to get comfortable with many grades of maybe. Sixers fans come up to me to say hello and many of them say the same thing (almost instinctively) as we part, “Good luck.” My standard reply: “Thanks. We’ll need it.”Be long science
Science is about predictions. Understanding the world until you can make a prediction about what will happen next. If you’re not sure, test it. Measure it. Do it again. See if it repeats.
“So if we want to think like a scientist more often in life, those are the three key objectives—to be humbler about what we know, more confident about what’s possible, and less afraid of things that don’t matter.” That’s from Tim Urban, who will soon be recognized as one of tomorrow’s polymaths (like many of you, he lives in New York—I’d recommend meeting him for coffee sometime).
For the Sixers, this has meant efforts like tracking every shot in every gym where we shoot, making predictions in writing about what we think will happen with a player or a team, and generally asking more questions about the game than some are comfortable to have said aloud.A healthy respect for tradition
While contrarian views are absolutely necessary to truly deliver, conventional wisdom is still wise. It is generally accepted as the conventional view because it is considered the best we have. Get back on defense. Share the ball. Box out. Run the lanes. Contest a shot. These things are real and have been measured, precisely or not, by thousands of men over decades of trial and error. Hank Iba. Dean Smith. Red Auerbach. Gregg Popovich. The single best place to start is often wherever they left off.
There are plenty of caricatures of our approach on your behalf, the most common of which is that folks here don’t even watch the games. That instead there is some mystical way by which we make decisions that doesn’t have anything to do with building a basketball team. That’s simply untrue.
Maybe someday the information teams have at their disposal won’t require scouring the globe watching talented players and teams. That day has not arrived, and my Marriott Rewards points prove it from all the Courtyards I sleep in from November to March. There is so much about projecting players that we still capture best by seeing it in person and sharing (and debating) those observations with our colleagues.
What kind of teammate is he? How does he play under pressure? How broken is his shot? Can he fight over a screen? Does he respond to coaching? How hard will he work to improve? And maybe the key one: will he sacrifice—his minutes, his touches, his shots, his energy, his body—for the ultimate team game that rewards sacrifice? That information, as imperfect and subjective as it may be, comes to light most readily in gyms and by watching an absolute torrent of video.
Some tradition awaits us everyday at the office. I inherited Marlene Barnes as my executive assistant, a widowed lifelong Philadelphian that joined the Sixers in the fall of 1977. I was born in the winter of 1977.
Marlene has worked for 11 different GMs and 5 head coaches at the Sixers. The names evoke many memories for you lifelong Sixers fans and students of history like me: Pat Williams, John Nash, Gene Shue, Jim Lynam, John Lucas, Brad Greenberg, Larry Brown, Billy King, Ed Stefanski, Rod Thorn. With us, she was immediately thrown into a new, more entrepreneurial work environment with a boss full of quirks different than any she had ever encountered. She adapted wonderfully, and now is a regular Slack wizard along with much of our staff, has seamlessly plugged into one productivity hack after another, and has ordered more books from Amazon than she ever thought possible. Her presence served as an everyday reminder to me of the impermanence of my leadership. I told her within a few weeks of working together that when I see her in the mornings I’m reminded that I am a steward—today’s steward—of her Sixers.A reverence for disruption
So often a new management regime looks at an organization and decides that the primary goal is to professionalize the operation. For you, I hope that doesn’t happen next. As I described to you in our first ever board meeting, we were fundamentally aiming for something different—disruption. We should concentrate our efforts in a few key areas in ways others had proven unwilling. We should attempt to gain a competitive advantage that had a chance to be lasting, hopefully one unforeseen enough by our competition to leapfrog them from a seemingly disadvantaged position. A goal that lofty is anything but certain. And it sure doesn’t come from those that are content to color within the lines.
This is true everywhere, as the balance in any market or any ecosystem ebbs and flows until something mostly unexpected lurches ahead. We see it in spades—past, present, and future.
• New Zealand’s flightless bird the moa (measuring in at 10 ft, 400 lbs.) had the life tramping around the South Island for a great long run; then the first Māori explorers washed ashore in canoes, and that was that.
• I still miss Blackberry’s keyboard, but the 2007 iPhone debut rendered it nearly obsolete to all but a few of us curmudgeons.
• Watch what’s happening with the collaboration between IBM’s Watson and M.D. Anderson or Google DeepMind’s AlphaGo. It won’t be just an ancient board game that’s disrupted. It’s also anything but a game to Lee Sedol.
Nobel Prize winning physicist Max Planck got right to it: “A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die.”
That sounds harsh, more harsh than anything I would ever say. But think about it in your context as an equity partner in the Sixers. Every April you will watch 16 of the 30 teams—the last time that exact configuration of players and coaches will ever be together—“die” as their season ends. Within a few weeks, another seven go fishing. By early June, 29 of the 30 opponents are forced to see the light of the competition’s greatness as only one raises the Larry O’Brien trophy.I can imagine that some of these sound contradictory: contrarian thinking, but respect for tradition, while looking to disrupt. That yin and yang is part of it—keep looking. Questioning.
Investment objectives
Starting position
In May of 2013 when I spoke with several of you—and even when we first met in the summer of 2012—the situation was clear. Your crops had been eaten. A team that clawed its way to a disappointing 34 wins in 2012-13 had a few handfuls of those wins walking out the door (Dorell Wright, Nick Young, Damien Wilkins, Royal Ivey) and a player that drove a bit more who had just undergone a surgery and was expected to be out for the season (Jason Richardson). That left the club with expected wins in the low 20s before replacing anyone. The young players on rookie-scale deals numbered two: Evan Turner & Arnett Moultrie. Two future first round picks were gone as was the recent youth pipeline of Nik Vučević & Moe Harkless. Gulp.
Outsiders agreed. ESPN regularly ranks the forward-looking three years for each team in their Future Power Rankings. They take into account the team’s current roster and future potential of those players as about half the rating, then include future draft picks, cap position, coaching, management, etc.
The Sixers near-term future ranked 24th in a 30-team league.
In the press conference announcing my arrival at the Sixers, I said:
• Our challenge was not for the faint of heart. It wasn’t.
• Our challenge was big enough to humble me to think about the enormity of it. It did.
We would have to get so very much right.
Goals
The strategy we settled on was straightforward, even if arduous. Replenish the talent pipeline, improve the quality and quantity of players on the roster, shift the style of play towards tomorrow’s champions, and become a culture focused on innovation.
You heard me speak of these goals at each of our quarterly board meetings; always the same since June of 2013. Variety is overrated.
This continuity of focus has served to frustrate many. I’ve found those most frustrated are those that either underestimate the enormity of the challenge or fundamentally want something else.
Specifically, we set out to maximize the odds of acquiring star players using all three available methods of acquiring players (draft, free agency, and trade).
1. Draft: invest in the deepest pool of star players—young players via the NBA Draft.
2. Free Agency: maintain financial flexibility to assume contract liabilities of other teams to acquire picks and prospects and move quickly toward special opportunities in signings/trade.
3. Trade: gather attractive, improving players to (best case) develop to win games for the Sixers, or (worst case) trade for better players or players likely to improve at a faster rate.
We determined to play a faster style that recognizes the importance of speed in tomorrow’s NBA and one that quickly integrates young players. We set out to improve our shot selection toward high efficiency basketball. We also wanted to build a defensive identity that—in time—could thwart tomorrow’s high-efficiency offenses. Lastly, we needed to build a world-class training center, develop an ever-evolving player development program, and change the organization’s culture to one of innovation and a constant search for competitive edge.
These goals were not to fit some preferred style of play, but instead were aiming for where future champions would be crowned. That original document I gave to Josh and David in 2012 said:
History’s lessons are clear, but tomorrow’s championship caliber teams may break from historical trends:
• Example: A 3PA-happy champion like Orlando under Stan Van Gundy
• Example: A fast-paced champion like Phoenix under Mike D’Antoni
Fast forward three years and Golden State made the 3rd most 3s in NBA history to win the Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers, who made the 8th most 3s in NBA history. Coach Van Gundy’s most 3PA-happy team from Orlando proudly sits smack dab between them in 5th place all time (for now). The Warriors did this in part by playing at the fastest pace of any NBA team last season, considerably faster than Coach D’Antoni’s fastest Suns team.
Results
The dozen of you know much about our team, our players, and how we’re positioned. I won’t waste your time by going through each person in detail, as you have had many opportunities to meet our coaches and players, hear about our talented staff, and see their performance dissected and analyzed in our meetings.
Instead, I will try to make the best use of your time by sharing some insight into the inner workings behind the scenes and a few details that aren’t appropriate for wider consumption.
Players
It is worth noting that over the long term, basketball teambuilding is about one primary thing—the players. Those players the team has on the roster at the time and those they hold the rights to. Plus those that are to follow. All of the operations, from management to coaches to support staff to systems only exist for one reason—the players.
We have had the good fortune of drafting relatively early, giving us access to some especially talented players, including Jahlil Okafor (#3), Joel Embiid (#3), and Nerlens Noel (#6). Many in our office tried to set a line of when Jahlil would see his first double team in this league. Those with the under looked smart by the end of opening night, where he went for 26 points and 7 rebounds.
We also put ourselves into position to draft in the second round, where we found two 22-year-old gems to date, including Jerami Grant (#39) and Richaun Holmes (#37). Outside of the top 60 selections delivered two more players with real NBA futures in 24-year-old T.J. McConnell and 25-year-old Robert Covington.
Robert is a mistake I rubbed my own nose in for over a year.
The 2013 Draft was a flurry of activity for us—a handful of trades and selections in both the first and second rounds. We had more action following the draft as we tried to finalize our summer league team and get the myriad trade calls set up with the NBA. I could see this coming a few days before and we informed the media that this kind of approach might lead to an unusually late start for the post-draft press conference. Several of you were still there late that night. At about 1:00 a.m. I went downstairs to address an equally exhausted media on deadline from their editors.
When I returned upstairs, the undrafted Robert Covington was gone, having agreed to play for another club’s summer league team, eventually making their regular season roster. He torched the D-League that year, haunting me all the while. When he became available 17 months later, we pounced. But I shudder, even now, at that (nearly) missed opportunity.
Even our efforts to support our players serve as a reminder of the enormity of our challenge.
Something important to us is to find ways to be supportive to our players' larger extended families and loved ones that take this journey with them. One group, too casually referred to as ""the wives club"" at many NBA teams, helps support players' families in getting acclimated to the city by handling tickets for loved ones, volunteering in community events, hosting baby showers, and the like. In 2013 my wife and I arrived at the arena one night to host a few from this group. While I was prepared to highlight for the group the team’s family room, child care at the arena, etc., it turned out that our attendance at this event totaled two. Two mothers. It was a pointed reminder of just how young our team was.
This story underscores what our players, particularly our best players, are in greatest need of—time.
The gap between driving wins today and driving wins tomorrow will be heavily influenced by a bunch of factors, but the biggest one is time. For players like Jahlil, Nerlens, and Jerami, getting much nearer the middle of their new NBA cohort will go a long way toward letting their talents shine through, just as it has their whole basketball lives when they were nearer the middle of those cohorts. Get down the experience curve, the faster the better. They are 20, 21, and 22 years old.A larger quiver
We need to identify high potential prospects and find ways to add them to our program. Then we need to work with them on their game in a targeted way to maximize their performance, their impact on the floor, and their value. One way is to draft them and put them on our 15-man roster. We do that.
Another is to draft them and hold their exclusive NBA rights while they play professionally in a league that doesn’t start with N and end with A. Now we do that.
These players can develop under our guidance while not counting against our roster, giving us not just 15 opportunities at one time, but several more. When appropriate for our team—but subject to buyout clauses in their professional contracts abroad—we can sign them to our club as one of our 15. This can happen within a season, at season’s end, or whenever their contract is available for buyout.
These sets of players are viable players for the Sixers and viable options to trade in the interim. The goal is simple—a larger quiver. This quiver will give us more options immediately and more options over time. Several players have been affiliated with us during the past several years while playing for teams in Australia, Asia, several clubs in Europe, and our minor-league affiliate the Delaware 87ers. As of now, we hold three players on this list, highlighted by the 21-year-old Dario Šarić. Dario is a 6-10 forward with a guard’s skills and a big’s toughness. Twice voted as FIBA European Young Player of the Year, we were in position to draft him in part because he required something you’ve had in ample supply: one part courage, two parts patience. He will look great in Sixers blue.
This approach, like many that create value, isn’t popular, particularly locally. But it’s also nothing new, just the same typeface bolded. It requires deep player evaluations around the globe, is helped by a network of international relationships, and most of all, patience. The venerable San Antonio Spurs don’t have three rights-held players playing internationally like we now do, they have thirteen. Most of their names are hard for many fans to pronounce. Ginobili used to be, too.
The NBA began this season with 100 international players from 37 countries on opening night rosters, comprising over 20% of the league. This is no set of wallflowers either, with four of the last thirteen Finals MVPs in this group. I pine for the days of the Long Beach Summer League at the Pyramid—I now spend as much time in China as Los Angeles.Draft picks
While the young players on our team and rights-held players internationally continue to show promise, our ability to add to that group by layering in additional high quality talent via the draft, free agency, and trade is at an all-time high.
In the first 26 months on the job we added more than one draft pick (or pick swap) per month to our coffers. That’s more than 26 new picks or options to swap picks over and above the two per year the NBA allots each club. That’s not any official record, because no one keeps track of such records. But it is the most ever. And it’s not close. And we kick ourselves for not adding another handful.
Many of us remember exactly where we were when tragedy strikes and we think of what could have been. For me—and this is sad for my own mental well being—that list includes the January day in 2014 when Miami traded Joel Anthony and two second round picks to our formidable competitors the Celtics. I can still picture the child’s play table I paced around at Lankenau Medical Center on my cell phone while negotiating with Miami’s front office. This was in between feedings for our newborn twins, when my wife and I were still sleeping in the hospital. Danny Ainge finalized that deal (and several other better ones) and received one first-place vote for Executive of the Year that season: mine.
We have used several of those picks to move around in the draft, to facilitate other deals, in trade for players to add to our team, and to select players for our team. Players like Jerami Grant (part of the haul from the Spencer Hawes trade), Nerlens Noel & Dario Saric (via the Jrue Holiday trade and its derivative), Ish Smith (used one of the two picks we acquired in the Eric Maynor trade, plus another), Richaun Holmes (part of the proceeds via the K.J. McDaniels trade), and others. Yet we still retain the rights to more future 2nd round picks at our disposal going forward than 27 other NBA teams.
In the upcoming May draft lottery, we have what will likely be the best ever odds to get the #1 overall pick (nearly 30%), a roughly 50/50 chance at a top-2 pick (the highest ever), and a roughly 50/50 chance at two top-5 picks, which would be the best lottery night haul ever. That same bounce of a ping pong ball (almost a flip of a coin) will determine if we have three first round picks this year (unusual) or four (unprecedented). That's this year. Or this quarter, if you will.
If you were to estimate the value of those firsts and the ones to follow, from this point forward we have essentially two NBA teams’ worth of first round pick value plus the third most second round picks in the league.Salary cap position
Our salary cap position going forward is easily the NBA's best. The most room, the most flexibility, providing the widest available set of options in free agency or trade of any club. This stockpile can be used all at once or strategically over the ensuing years to acquire players that fit your team, improve in your development program, and help you move up the standings. During this phase of acquiring players and picks to really invest in our future and climb higher than we have in over 30 years, we spent a bit over $135M on payroll across the three seasons, while the NBA median spend was over $200M. That won’t last, as over time a climb up the standings will see spend rise precipitously as well.
These advantages over our competitors are material, but well short of deterministic. From here a whole host of solid decisions are necessary to play our hand out of this stacked deck.Other
Building a talent pipeline into our program, while important, is of course not the only goal we had.
Even with young players and expected roster turnover, we needed to move the club toward a style that was conducive to winning in tomorrow’s NBA. We improved our pace from below average to 1st immediately, then settled into about 6th for the next two seasons. We moved our shot selection from consistently bottom two in the league to consistently 2nd in the league. And our defensive principles are increasingly top-notch, showing that we can play above average defense (13th) when we had solid veteran defenders like Luc Mbah a Moute on the roster, but also struggle with some of the NBA’s youngest talent defending every night (bottom 5).
Outlook
Your club is on solid footing now, with much hard work yet to be done. As we continued to invest in young players, acquire more draft selections, and maintain cap flexibility the forward-looking markets took notice. Our Future Franchise Rankings (ESPN’s) that began at 24th in a 30-team league in May of 2013 climbed to 19th in 2014, 17th in 2015, and most recently via RealGM’s rankings in December of 2015, 12th. I think that is imminently reasonable, as is a couple of spots higher.
Lottery night will be nerve-wracking for most and exciting for all. I said to Josh & David last year during the NBA’s Draft Lottery that it is rare for the importance of luck in our lives to be laid bare for the whole world to see. Walking out with a top-5 pick in each hand would be exciting, but it’s not necessary. The rights to those picks don’t extinguish, but instead move forward to a future year, one filled with new possibilities and challenges both.
Regardless of the haul that comes out of a May night in New York, the team is likely to see additional lottery pick talent hit the court next season regardless. Two additional first round picks this year are available to you as well. Plus additional draft picks are set to flow in regularly for many years to come. Plus the league’s best cap position. A bevy of young players. A deep and passionate coaching staff. An innovative management team. A beautiful new practice facility set to open before training camp. In a city with wonderful basketball heritage. You could do worse.
The NBA can be a league of desperation, those that are in it and those that can avoid it. So many find themselves caught in the zugzwang, the point in the game where all possible moves make you worse off. Your positioning is now the opposite of that.
A sincere thank you
Thank you for the opportunity you all gave me to lead this storied franchise. My gratification is beyond my power to express. What is unequivocal is that the principal beneficiary of your largesse has been me. Thank you.
Philadelphia has been wonderful to our family. Two of our children were born here. Lincoln said that to meet with the public “renewed in me my perceptions of responsibility and duty.” Those words rang hollow until we moved here and I talked with our fans. Everywhere I went, lifelong Sixers fans told me stories about how they wanted the team to be good again--really good.
It’s clear now that I won’t see the harvest of the seeds we planted. That’s OK. Life’s like that. Many of my NBA friends cautioned me against the kind of seed sowing that felt appropriate given the circumstances for exactly this reason. But this particular situation made it all the more necessary, though. Part of the reason to reject fear and plow on was exactly because fear had been the dominant motivator of the actions of too many for too long.
I will be repotted professionally. That is often uncomfortable; most growth is. But it’s also often healthier over the longer sweep of history, too.
In the interim, I’ll probably be with my wife and kids for a few weeks. If you need to reach me—now or later—I am available at  and I suspect someday soon on Twitter via @samhinkie.
I wish you the best of luck. Like other Sixers fans, I will cross my fingers for you on lottery night in New York."

Isa lang ang ibig sabihin
Nahihiya mang amining
Ang dating hindi seryoso

Kapag kasama ka para bang araw araw pasko

Kung pano iningatan ka nung una, nung una palang kitang nakilala
Di ko na kailangan na sabihin pa, kasi dapat kong ipadama sa'yo na maniwala ka
At mas palalimin pa para mas paibigin ka
Wala nang dapat isipin, sobrang saya ko sa piling mo
Kung bakit umibig ulit ako, ikaw ang dapat sisihin ko
Simula nung makita kita tsaka ko nakita na magkaiba
At mas madaling magbigay halaga kesa magpasaya

Ihahatid kita kahit na ga'no kalayo
Hanggang sa harapan ng inyong bahay
Magmamano pa 'ko lagi sa iyong nanay
At hindi rin ako tatanggi kay tatay, kada bigay ng tagay
Mag-text at tawag ka kapag kailangan mo ko

Tapos na nga hugasan ang mga kamay ng mga makata
Lahat na yata tayo ay makata

Ikaw na naman di ba kalalabas mo lang
Kung magsulat ka ng kanta para bang papasko lang
Tila lupang di tigang sa letra mong bilang
Walang tigil sa pag-agos pinapadulas mo lang
Hindi naman superlolo pero bakit sumasabog
Ang lahat na kuha mo kahit di makapal ang abo
Pinagmanhid manao ibang klaseng Tagalog
Parang altak preston sa kumakapal na batok
Tapos na ang biruan walang pala-palabo
Wag kang gumamit ng berdeng butas sa pagsalok
Magpaabot pag napagod pag humagok magpadagok
Laging handa sa pagsusulit kahit walang pasok
Ang bata na inaral ang aba-kada
E gahai-laman na nga o para sa tao waya
Kundi makasabay sa aking makakaya
Bumaba ka sa aking pasada mama para
Ibalik ang bayad sumayod ang speaker sa lakas
Ng tunog lumubog ang mga mapangahas
Na humahamig kahit na hangin lang ang kinahig
Nag-uunahan sa pagtampot ng putik at ipahid
Ako ang magaling palaging sinisigaw
Sa loob ng kaing na may kalboro ang manggang hilaw
O kandilang tunaw o itak na bingaw
Pag pinagsama natin ang dalawa, oo ikaw
Matagal-tagal na rin po akong nagtatampisaw
Sa tubig na kung minsan ay parang kanal sa hangin
Kaya may oras na parang gusto kong bumitaw
Ngunit salamat sa hindi nagdadala sa akin
Pero aaminin ko nakakapanghinayang
Lisanin ang trabaho na kailangan mong tibayan
Ang mukha mo panibago kasibado natula to
Sa mukha mo itaya mo patibato ano kamo
Bawat CD-ing nabenta mo walang pang limang piso
Ang babalik sa'yo teka wala kang pinipiso
Pero ayos lang kasi ito ang yong pinagdasal
Di man kasing bango ng lahat ng nahahalal
Mga nakakadinig sila ang sumatotal
Pagkataong humukay ng panibagong bukhal
Na humuhubog sa isip ng mga batang may pangarap
Kahit anong mangyari wag kang bibitaw sa yakap

Ikaw lang talaga ang aking gusto makinig ka naman please dito sa puso ko
Bago pa mahuli ang lahat para saten ikaw lang talaga yung gusto ko na mapasakin

Masaya na ako pero bakit sinaktan sana ay pansinin ang nararamdan
Sabihin man nilang ako'y nahihibang pagmamahal ko sa iyo'y ipagyayabang
Akala ko ba satin ay walang hadlang pero bakit ngayon ay iniwan mo lang

'Di ka iiwanan ikaw yung tahanan 'di ba ('di ba)
Kahit san man tayo magpunta
Tinadhanang magkikita ('di ba)
Kung ang oras man ay humadlang
Pipiliting balikan

Alas dose ng gabi dilat pa din ating mata
Kahit hindi mag katabi
Kahagkan pa din kita
Sulyap ko
Mga ngiti mo magmula sa kabila
Ramdam ko din ang takot dahil ikaw ay nagdududa
Kung sigurado ka ba sakin
Kung dapat bang ikaw ay maging akin at lahat
Ay isugal sa di tiyak na tatahakin mong landas
Iniisip na lahat ng to ay matatapos at biglaan nalang kukupas
Pagdating ng panahon
Aakalain ay ikukulong sa kahon
Iiwanan pag nagkaroon ng pagkakataon
Kahit problema'y mala ambon lang
Aba mali ka kung ganon
Hinding hindi ko saiyo magagawa iyon
Kaya sakin na lang
Itugon ang pansin pag tingin ko sayo
Ay walang kahambing

Oo kakaiba mga gulo sa isip mo'y 'di alinta kaya huwag
Mababahala na sumama sakin
Sabay ka lang sa biyahe wag kang bababa
Sa'kin magtiwala ka
Matakot man ganon lang talaga sasaluhin kita
Dadalhin kita ipapasan ka sa likod kapag napagod ang paa

Hhindi ka mananalo kung
Hindi ka susugal sa laro ng puso
At lalong hindi kita sasalubungin para lang
Sumalungat at iwan kang mag-isa sa mundong mapaglaro
Alam ko na gusto mo din
Kaya wag kang magbibiro malilito

Olvida que está todo bien ahora
No te desanimes
El único problema que las mujeres no deberían ser
Deja que te persigan?
Te dije todo lo que era un tonto
Entonces te beneficiarás de repente
Así que no vuelvas a repetir ... Así que no lo repitas más

¿Cómo sabemos cuándo aprender?
El amor es un dolor de cabeza
¿Por qué tienes la velocidad?
Créelo? no estás aquí pronto
Anteriormente visto algunas veces
Simplemente no quiero que te lastimen
No quiero bajar, bajar
Tú eliges la mayoría ahora porque es fácil
Es fácil aburrirse cuando se trata de estar en este momento
Piense en eso pre

Pre-despacio con su enamoramiento
Para una criatura que solo necesitas
Deberías olvidar esos problemas
Porque es solo una niña
Sé que sabes que es libre de engañar
Pero es malo para ti planificar todos los días
Esas mujeres deberían detenerte
Con el estúpido número, no deberías ser uno
Entonces avísame si eres un tonto
Avísame si es un juego
Avísame si puedes irte porque te digo que sí
Todos los fraudes
Olvida que está todo bien ahora
No te desanimes
El único problema que las mujeres no deberían ser
Deja que te persigan?
Les dije a todos
Después de que te acostumbras, de repente desaparece
Así que no vuelvas a repetir ... Entonces no lo hagas
Repetir

Solo usarán tu popularidad
Te digo que todos son fieras perras
Solo las riquezas no mantienen tu personalidad y
¡Los sentimientos desde el principio no son suficientes!
A quién quieres que te pillen
Lo usarás gradualmente para sokeramai
Entonces no te rías de eso
Debes ser el hombre que está cansado

Entonces deja que te persigan
Porque no solo son utilizables
Entonces, créanme más que otros
Echemos un vistazo al resto del mundo
¿Por qué no digo eso?
Tu piel también es tu amiga (¡Oye, oye!)
Cuántas veces se te rompió el corazón
Ira cuando te dicen (Oh sí)
Sabes que también conozco la ira de la mujer
'Voy a ser un peón así que si no hago eso
Es solo un tipo que ha estado a su lado
Case es simplemente ignorante por la fuerza de la palabra
No es sorprendente que esta sea la situación hoy
No sé qué decir, siempre que sepa lo que es

Olvida que está todo bien ahora
No te desanimes
El único problema que las mujeres no deberían ser
Deja que te persigan?
Les dije a todos
Después de que te acostumbras, de repente desaparece
Así que no vuelvas a repetir ... Entonces no lo hagas
Repetir

Uhmm .. Mm.Rm ..
No te preocupes si lo dejas
No te preocupes por eso
Solo ve con risa en lugar de asombro
Hasta que te acostumbras porque realmente son
Puede que no sepa que no es lo mismo que el dedo
Te lastimaste así que es fácil
No te dejes engañar por el mundo
Lo único que sabes es que las personas solo saben que no quieres
Engañate para que los dejes mirar hacia arriba
Así que ... hasta que todos te persigan cuando hagas eso
Lo siento por ti
De-de-de Hay tantas perras en el club (en el club)
Hay tantos bebés sexy ¿no te ves?
Vamos a beberlo ... pero el triste pare
No es eso! Por favor escucha la hora ahora
No hay mujer sensata ... crees en lo que dices
Lo sé porque soy tonto
Así que es hora de decir adiós, decir adiós
No dejes que tu novia arregle esta noche
No más chica en este momento
Todo el mundo me está engañando si soy tú (Ohhhh ..)

Sa bawat sandali
O andito ka ba para
Sa bawal na parti
Oh hinde
Tama o mali
Kahapon magkaaway
Sa gabi mag ba-bati
Oh hinde mapakali oh
Habang papalapit
Ang labi mo sa akin
Parang ayaw na hindi
Sabi mo wala naman
Ibig sabihin kasi
Oh andito lang naman
Ako para sagipin
Sa gitna ng kawalan
Di na makawala
Mahanap ang liwanag
Hinayaan na kasi

Mag-uumaga na naman
At ikaw ang katabi
Bakit ba andito pa
'Di ka pa umuuwi
Sabi pagod lang talaga
Gustong magpahinga
Umaga na naman kami natapos kagabi
Mag-uumaga na naman
At ikaw ang katabi
Kasabay kang masilayan
Ang araw ko'ng mali
At habang andito ka
Gustong magpahinga
Umaga na naman kami natapos kagabi
Mag-uumaga na naman, ano na?
Siguradong hinahanap ka na
Sa inyo kasi
Mag-uumaga na naman, ano na?
Sabi mo hindi naman kailangan na mag madali
Yung bintana sinara
Baka tumakas ang lamig
Kinandado na parte
Pero malaya pa kame
Guluhin ang mga mesa
Kama pati sapin
Baka sakali lang
Maayos natin sa dilim

Sabi mo wala namang
Ibig sabihin kase
O, andito lang naman
Ako para sagipin

Hindi nangangamba
Kahit hamunin ng takot
Hindi ito tutumba
Kilalang palaban 'di nag-aalangan
Sugod lang sa pangarap ano man ang daan
Sa init at lubak, sa hirap at lumbay
Dirediretso lang sa tagumpay
Para sa tapang na tunay
Para sa tibay at husay
Isang tagay sa mga ganado sa buhay
Para sa pusong lalaban

Malagay man sa pangamba
Lahat yan hindi uubra
Kitang kita ang angas sa mata
'Di natatalo, dahil natututo
Kahit mapagod walang balak sumuko
Hindi matitibag ang pag-asa
Dahil sama-sama sa pag-arangkada
Kilalang palaban 'di nag-aalangan
Sugod lang sa pangarap ano man ang daan
Sa init at lubak, sa hirap at lumbay
Diretso lang sa tagumpay
Para sa tapang na tunay
Para sa tibay at husay
Isang tagay sa mga ganado sa buhay

Anu man ang kalaban madami man yan o higante
Never say die lang ang sinisigaw palagi
'Di mo masisindak, 'di mo malilinlang
Ika'y makakatiyak 'di mapipigil ang pangarap

Hindi pwedeng bahala na lang
Kailangang planado ang laban
Nakatutok at nakaabang

Matapang ako, lalaban ako

Mauugat, maaalog
Ang eksena 'pag ako nag-upload
Mati-tilt na naman sa 'kin balance of power
Hindi sapat ang pasaload (nope)
'Di na 'ko babalik sa FlipTop
(Snitched myself to save you time)
Babaliktad lang ang aking utak
'Pag 'yung six ay ginawa mong nine

At hamunin ko rin kaya si A.E?
Feels like I want everyone to hate me
Nawala kasi 'yung gutom ko lately
Mula nu'ng nag-champion nu'ng 2018
'Yung mga tao, biglang nag-180
Sumapi tuloy sa akin si Juan Lazy
Buti na-inspire sa side B ni Shady
He brought back to life
'Yung B side na Shehyee (whoo)

Daming tanga no'n
Mga linyang tumatak, akin mga 'yon
Kahit itanong niyo pa kay Smugg
Sasagutin kayo no'n galing sa ilong
Kung babalikan ang dating panahon
Nabuhat lang ang sabi-sabi noon
'Di kasi alam na ako ang creator
Kaya tawag ng laro sa 'kin (Patapon)
Yah, kahit na gano'n
Wait, ano? Teka muna
Patapon? Creator? Laro?
'Yung sa PSP? 'Di mo nakuha?
'Di kaya mali 'yung aking delivery kaya 'di nakuha?
O masyado nang sinauna?
Anyway, marami nga palang patapon
Sa larong kailangang ibasura

Kailangan ng kalinga ng rap
Kaya mambabatok ako gamit tinta
At kakantiin ko lahat
Wala 'kong paki kahit Titan ka pa
Alam naman ng fans na I'm Levi
Shehyee's a Leviathan, bitch!
Old school, new school, whenever I open my mouth
They'll get devoured like a school of fish
(Oh, 'kala ko sa album ka pa mag-i-English?)
(Ay, sorry, sorry, oo nga pala, game, take two)

Kailangan ng kalinga ng rap
Mambabatok ako gamit tinta
Kaso nga lang hindi ko ma-tag
Puro fake 'yung accounts, ang dami nila
Kaya nga ang hilig pumutak
Nakatago sa dummy, takot magisa sa sariling mantika
Mga ayaw magpakita ng mukha
Palibhasa, mga pangit sila
Mga pangit sila
'Tang ina niyo, mga pangit
Sa totoo lang, 'di ko kayo gustong awayin
Miss ko lang manlait
I'm sorry if I am a dick
Sayang gift at talent, 'di ko nagagamit
My penmanships parang titi
Tumitira tuwing nagagalit

Ang lambot niya ngayon
'Di kasi natsa-challenge
Plan ko pa namang magpaulan
Ng mga linyang may katuwiran, 'di na bali
Sa parating na album niyo na lang abangan
Ang aking mga 'di nasabi
Sa ngayon, commercial muna tayo
Si Sen. Manny, may mensahe
(Happy New Year)
(Happy New Year)
(Happy New Year, everyone)
(Whoo)

Sana ngayong bagong taon
'Yung mga taong minumura ni Gadon
Mabawasan naman lalo na 'yung
Mga naka-face mask pero 'di kasama ilong
May bago pa namang strain COVID, the fuck
Mawala na rin sana fake content na prank
Maputulan sana ng internet
Mga taong 'di pa nababasa article, may comment agad

Higit sa lahat
Sana effective 'yung vaccine
At sana rin matuloy incoming laban
Ni Pacman at McGregor sa boxing
Sana rin dumami pa gumawa
Ng mga track at mag-record sa rap scene
Pero my advice is this
Next year mo release kasi 2021'y akin

I-claim mo agad
Una, angkinin mo tapos pray mo kay God
Basta gawin mo lahat, kung may pumalag
Sampalin mo ng plain na burat (time, time, time, time)
I ain't havin' that
Even Anygma ain't stopping me rap
Even a blackhole, a problem you can't solve
Today, like your traveling pass

'Tang ina, sorry napa-Ingles na naman ako
Nako, nakakainis ka naman, wala sa plano 'to
Pa'no 'pag namintis ka sa ganyan, 'kala mo kaya mo
'Di ako nagmi-miss, pare, ala Mika Daime 'to
Hindi ko natiis, nabanggit ko tuloy pangalan mo
Ngayon alam mo, miss, ang dami naming nagkakagulo
Isa 'ko sa nabwisit sa 'yo sa kadayaan mo
Kung umamin ka, jeez, 'di ka sana nagkakaganto

Pero one of the reason bakit ko sinasabi 'to
Alam ko guys, easy ikondena ang taong 'to
Reminder lang please, 'wag limutin pagkatao niyo
Everyone say, ""Cheese"", tignan mo litrato mo
'Yung points kay Jesus, nababawasan, hay nako
Tama na 'yung diss lalo na sa times na gan'to
Hindi ako divided sa issue, ito'y lesson sa iyo
In addition, pakinggan mo bituin na kanta ko

Kung magaling ka sa mathematic
Gets mo agad mga sinabi ko
One plus one lang, pare ko
Too much na 'yung nangyayari, bro
Sa bibig na lumalabas 'yung tae niyo
Tingin ko din aimbot
Pero masyado nang foul
Andito 'ko kung gusto niyo pa ng trash-talk

Teka, laro muna"
73,168033268,"Singsing (From ""Abay Babes"")",Ex Battalion,[18],['Hip Hop/Rap'],"Tale of King Omar Bin Al-Nu'uman and His Sons Sharrkan and Zau Al-Makan
And What Befel Them of Things Seld-Seen and Peregrine.
The King asked her, ""And what was their story?"" and she answered: It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that there was in the City of Safety, Baghdad, before the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik bin Marwán, a King, Omar bin al-Nu'umán highs, who was of the mighty giants and had subjected the Chosroës of Persia and the Kaysars of Eastern Rome; for none could warm himself at his fire; nor could any avail to meet him in the field of foray and fray; and, when he was angered, there came forth from his nostrils sparks of flame. He had made himself King over all quarters, and Allah had subjected to him all His creatures; his word went forth to all great cities and his hosts had harried the farthest lands. East and West had come under his command with whatsoever regions lay interspersed between them, Hind and Sind and Sin, the Holy Land, Al-Hijaz, the rich mountains of Al-Yaman and the archipelagos of India and China. Moreover, he reigned supreme over the north country and Diyár Bakr, or Mesopotamia, and over Sudán, the Eastern Negro land and the Islands of the Ocean, and all the far famed rivers of the earth, Sayhún and Jayhún, Nile and Euphrates. He sent envoys and ambassadors to capitals the most remote, to provide him with true report; and they would bring back tidings of justice and peace, with assurance of loyalty and obedience and of prayers in the pulpits for King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; for he was, O Ruler of the Age, a right noble King; and there came to him presents of rarities and toll and tribute from all lands of his governing. This mighty monarch had a son yclept Sharrkan, who was likest of all men to his father and who proved himself one of the prodigies of his time for subduing the brave and bringing his contemporaries to bane and ban. For this his father loved him with love so great none could be greater, and made him heir to the kingdom after himself. This Prince grew up till he reached man's estate and was twenty years old, and Allah subjected His servants to him, by reason of his great might and prowess in battle. Now his father, King Omar, had four wives legally married, but Allah had vouchsafed him no son by them, save Sharrkan, whom he had begotten upon one of them, and the rest were barren. Moreover he had three hundred and sixty concubines, after the number of days in the Coptic year, who were of all nations; and he had furnished for each and every a private chamber within his own palace. For he had built twelve pavilions, after the number of the months, each containing thirty private chambers, which thus numbered three hundred and three score, wherein he lodged his handmaids: and he appointed according to law for each one her night, when he lay with her and came not again to her for a full year; and on this wise he abode for a length of time. Meanwhile his son Sharrkan was making himself renowned in all quarters of the world and his father was proud of him and his might waxed and grew mightier; so that he passed all bounds and bore himself masterfully and took by storm castles and cities. Presently, by decree of the Decreer, a handmaid among the handmaids of Omar bin Nu'uman became pregnant; and, her pregnancy being announced to the Harim, the King was informed thereof; whereupon he rejoiced with exceeding joy and said, ""Haply it will be a son, and so all my offspring will be males!"" Then he documented the date of her conception and entreated her with all manner of kindness. But when the tidings came to Sharrkan, he was troubled and the matter seemed to him a sore one and a grievous; and he said, ""Verily one cometh who shall dispute with me the sovereignty:"" so quoth he to himself, ""If this concubine bear a male child I will kill it:"" but he kept that intention hidden in his heart. Such was the case with Sharrkan; but what happened in the matter of the damsel was as follows. She was a Roumiyah, a Greek girl, by name Sofiyah or Sophia, whom the King of Roum and Lord of Cæsarea had sent to King Omar as a present, together with great store of gifts and of rarities: she was the fairest of favour and loveliest of all his handmaids and the most regardful of her honour; and she was gifted with a wit as penetrating as her presence was fascinating. Now she had served the King on the night of his sleeping with her, saying to him, ""O King! I desire of the God of the Heavens that he bless thee this night with a male child by me, so I may bring him up with the best of rearing, and enable him to reach man's estate perfect in intelligence, good manners and prudent bearing""—a speech which much pleased the King. During her pregnancy she was instant in prayer, fervently supplicating the Lord to bless her with a goodly male child and make his birth easy to her; and Allah heard her petition so that after her months were accomplished she sat safely upon the birth stool. Now the King had deputed a eunuch to let him know if the child she should bring forth were male or female; and in like way his son Sharrkan had sent one to bring him tidings of the same. In due time Sophia was delivered of a child, which the midwives examined and found to be a girl with a face sheenier than the moon. So they announced this to all present in the room, whereupon the King's messenger carried the news to him; and Sharrkan's eunuch did the like with his master who rejoiced with exceeding joy. But, after the two had departed, quoth Sophia to the midwives, ""Wait with me awhile, for I feel as if there were still somewhat in my womb."" Then she cried out and the pains of child bed again took her; and Allah made it easy to her and she gave birth to a second child. The wise women looked at it and found it a boy like the full moon, with forehead flower white, and cheek ruddy bright with rosy light; whereupon the mother rejoiced, as did the eunuchs and attendants and all the company; and Sophia was delivered of the after birth whilst all in the palace sent forth the trill of joy. The rest of the concubines heard it and envied her lot; and the tidings reached Omar son of Al- Nu'uman, who was glad and rejoiced at the excellent news. Then he rose and went to her and kissed her head, after which he looked at the boy; and, bending over him, kissed him, whilst the damsels struck the tabors and played on instruments of music; and the King gave order that the boy should be named Zau al-Makán and his sister Nuzhat al-Zamán. They answered ""Hearing and obedience,"" and did his bidding; so he appointed wet nurses and dry nurses and eunuchs and attendants to serve them; and assigned them rations of sugar and diet drinks and unguents and else beside, beyond the power of tongue to rehearse. Moreover the people of Baghdad, hearing that Allah had blessed their King with issue, decorated the city and made proclamation of the glad tidings with drum and tom tom; and the Emirs and Wazirs and high dignitaries came to the palace and wished King Omar bin al-Nu'uman joy of his son, Zau al-Makan, and of his daughter Nuzhat al-Zaman, wherefore he thanked them and bestowed on them dresses of honour and further favoured them with gifts, and dealt largesse to all, gentle and simple, who were present. After this fashion he did for four days full told, and he lavished upon Sophia raiment and ornaments and great store of wealth; and, every few days he would send a messenger to ask after her and the new-borns. And when four years had gone by, he provided her with the wherewithal to rear the two children carefully and educate them with the best of instructions. All this while his son Sharrkan knew not that a male child had been born to his father, Omar son of Al-Nu'uman, having news only that he had been blessed with the birth of Nuzhat al-Zaman; and they hid the intelligence from him, until days and years had sped by, whilst he was busied in battling with the brave and fighting single handed against the knights. One day, as King Omar was sitting in his palace, his Chamberlains came in to him and, kissing the ground before him, said, ""O King there be come Ambassadors from the King of Roum, Lord of Constantinople the Great, and they desire admission to thee and submission to thy decree: if the King commend us to introduce them we will so do; and, if not, there is no disputing his behest."" He bade them enter and, when they came in, he turned to them and, courteously receiving them, asked them of their case, and what was the cause of their coming. They kissed the ground before him and said, ""O King glorious and strong! O lord of the arm that is long! know that he who despatched us to thee is King Afrídún, Lord of Ionia land and of the Nazarene armies, the sovereign who is firmly established in the empery of Constantinople, to acquaint thee that he is now waging fierce war and fell with a tyrant and a rebel, the Prince of Casarea; and the cause of this war is as follows. One of the Kings of the Arabs in past time, during certain of his conquests, chanced upon a hoard of the time of Alexander, whence he removed wealth past compute; and, amongst other things, three round jewels, big as ostrich eggs, from a mine of pure white gems whose like was never seen by man. Upon each were graven characts in Ionian characters, and they have many virtues and properties, amongst the rest that if one of these jewels be hung round the neck of a new-born child, no evil shall befal him and he shall neither wail, nor shall fever ail him as long as the jewel remain without fail. When the Arab King laid hands upon them and learned their secrets, he sent to King Afridun presents of certain rarities and amongst them the three jewels afore mentioned; and he equipped for the mission two ships, one bearing the treasure and the other men of might to guard it from any who might offer hindrance on the high seas, albeit well assured that none would dare waylay his vessels, for that he was King of the Arabs, and more by token that their course lay over waters subject to the King of Constantinople and they were bound to his port; nor were there on the shores of that sea any save the subjects of the Great King, Afridun. The two ships set out and voyaged till they drew near our city, when there sallied out on them certain corsairs from that country and amongst them troops from the Prince of Caesarea, who took all the treasures and rarities in the ships, together with the three jewels, and slew the crews. When our King heard of this, he sent an army against them, but they routed it; then he marched a second and a stronger but they put this also to flight,—whereupon the King waxed wroth and swore that he would not go forth against them save in his own person at the head of his whole army; nor would he turn back from them till he had left Caesarea, of Armenia in ruins and had laid waste all the lands and cities over which her Prince held sway. So he sent us to the Lord of the age and the time, Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman, King of Baghdad and of Khorasan, desiring that he aid us with an army, so may honour and glory accrue to him; and he hath also forwarded by us somewhat of various kinds of presents, and of the King's grace he beggeth their acceptance and the friendly boon of furtherance."" Then the Ambassadors kissed the ground before him,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Forty-sixth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that, after the Ambassadors and retinue from the Constantinopolitan King had kissed the ground before Omar and had delivered their embassage, they brought out the presents, which were fifty damsels of the choicest from Graecia-land, and fifty Mamelukes in tunics of brocade, belted with girdles of gold and silver, each wearing in his ears hoops of gold with pendants of fine pearls costing a thousand ducats every one. The girls were adorned in like fashion and were clad in stuffs worth a treasury of money. When the King saw them, he rejoiced in them and accepted them; then he bade the Ambassadors be honourably entreated and, summoning his Wazirs, took counsel with them of what he should do. Herewith rose up among them a Wazir, an ancient man, Dandan highs, who kissed the ground before Omar and said, ""O King, there is nothing better to do in this matter than equip an army valiant and victorious, and set over it thy son Sharrkan with us as his lieutenants; and this rede commendeth itself to me on two counts; first, because the King of Roum hath invoked thine assistance and hath sent thee gifts which thou hast accepted; and, secondly, because while no enemy dareth attack our country, thine army may go forth safely and, should it succour the King of Graecia-land and defeat his foe, the glory will be thine. Moreover, the news of it will be noised abroad in all cities and countries and especially, when the tidings shall reach the Islands of the Ocean and the Kings of Mauritania shall hear it, they will send thee offerings of rarities and pay thee tribute of money."" The King pleased by the Wazir's words and approving his rede, gave him a dress of honour and said to him, ""Of the like of thee should Kings ask counsel, and it seemeth fit that thou shouldst conduct the van of our army and our son Sharrkan command the main battle."" Then he sent for his son who came and kissed ground before him and sat down; and he expounded to him the matter, telling him what the Ambassadors and the Wazir Dandan had said, and he charged him to take arms and equip himself for the campaign, enjoining him not to gainsay Dandan in aught he should do. Moreover, he ordered him to pick out of his army ten thousand horsemen, armed cap-à-pie and inured to onset and stress of war. Accordingly, Sharrkan arose on the instant, and chose out a myriad of horsemen, after which he entered his palace and mustered his host and distributed largesse to them, saying, ""Ye have delay of three days."" They kissed the earth before him in obedience to his commands and began at once to lay in munitions, and provide provisions for the occasion; whilst Sharrkan repaired to the armouries and took therefrom whatsoever he required of arms and armour, and thence to the stable where he chose horses of choice blood and others. When the appointed three days were ended, the army drew out to the suburbs of Baghdad city; and King Omar came forth to take leave of his son who kissed the ground before him and received from the King seven parcels of money. Then he turned to Danden and commended to his care the army of his son; and the Wazir kissed the ground before him and answered, ""I hear and I obey;"" and lastly he charged Sharrkan that he should consult the Wazir on all occasions, which he promised to do. After this, the King returned to his city and Sharrkan ordered the officers to muster their troops in battle array. So they mustered them and their number was ten thousand horsemen, besides footmen and camp followers. Then they loaded their baggage on their beasts and the war drums beat and the trumpets blared and the bannerols and standards were unfurled, whilst Sharrkan mounted horse, with the Wazir Dandan by his side, and the colours fluttering over their heads. So the host fared forth and stinted not faring, with the ambassadors preceding them, till day departed and night drew nigh, when they alighted and encamped for the night. And as soon as Allah caused the morn tomorrow, they mounted and tried on, guided by the Ambassadors, for a space of twenty days; and by the night of the twenty first they came to a fine and spacious Wady well grown with trees and shrubbery. Here Sharrkan ordered them to alight and commanded a three days' halt, so they dismounted and pitched their tents, spreading their camp over the right and the left slopes of the extensive valley, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the Ambassadors of King Afridun pitched in the sole of the Wady. As for Sharrkan, he tarried behind them for awhile till all had dismounted and had dispersed themselves over the valley sides; he then slacked the reins of his steed, being minded to explore the Wady and to mount guard in his own person, because of his father's charge and owing to the fact that they were on the frontier of Graecia land and in the enemy's country. So he rode out alone after ordering his armed slaves and his body guard to camp near the Wazir Dandan, and he fared on along the side of the valley till a fourth part of the night was passed, when he felt tired and drowsiness overcame him, so that he could no longer urge horse with heel. Now he was accustomed to take rest on horseback; so when slumber overpowered him, he slept and the steed ceased not going on with him till half the night was spent and entered one of the thickets which was dense with growth; but Sharrkan awoke not until his horse stumbled over wooded ground. Then he started from sleep and found himself among the trees, and the moon arose and shone brightly over the two horizons, Eastern and Western. He was startled when he found himself alone in this place and said the say which ne'er yet shamed its sayer, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!"" But as he rode on, in fear of wild beasts, behold, the moon spread her glad light over a meadow as if it were of the meads of Paradise; and he heard pleasant voices and a loud noise of talk and laughter captivating the senses of men. So King Sharrkan alighted and, tying his steed to one of the trees, went over a little way till he came upon a stream and heard a woman talking in Arabic and saying, ""Now by the crush of the Messiah, this is not well of you! but whose utters a word, I will throw her and truss her up with her own girdle!"" He kept walking in the direction of the sound and when he reached the further side he looked and behold, a stream was gushing and flowing, and antelopes at large were frisking and roving, and wild cattle amid the pasture moving, and birds expressed joy and gladness in their divers tongues, and that place was purfled with all manner flowers and green herbs, even as a poet described it in these couplets,
""Most beautiful is earth in budding bloom, * When lucid waters
            course through plain and wood:
No work but His th' All great, th' All glorious, * Giver of all
            gifts, Giver of all good!""
And as Sharrkan considered the place, he saw in it a Christian Monastery within whose enceinte a castle towered high in air catching the light of the moon. Through the midst of the convent passed a stream, the water flowing amongst its gardens; and upon the bank sat the woman whose voice he had heard, while before her stood ten handmaids like moons and wearing various sorts of raiment and ornaments that dazed and dazzled the beholder, high bosomed virgins, as saith of them the poet in these couplets,
""The mead is bright with what is on't * Of merry maidens
            debonnair:
Double its beauty and its grace * Those trooping damsels slender-
           fair:
Virgins of graceful swimming gait * Ready with eye and lip to
            ensnare;
And like the tendril'd vine they loose * The rich profusion of
            their hair:
Shooting their shafts and arrows from * Beautiful eyes beyond
          compare;
Overpowering and transpiercing * Every froward adversaire.""
Sharrkan gazed upon the ten girls and saw in their midst a lady like the moon at fullest, with ringleted hair and forehead sheeny white, and eyes wondrous wide and black and bright, and temple locks like the scorpion's tail; and she was perfect in essence and attributes, as the poet said of her in these couplets,
""She beamed on my sight with a wondrous glance, * And her
            straight slender stature enshamed the lance:
She burst on my sight with cheeks rosy red, * Where all manner of
            beauties have habitance:
And the locks on her forehead were lowering as night * Whence
            issues a dawn tide of happiest chance.""
Then Sharrkan heard her say to the handmaids, ""Come ye on, that I may wrestle with you and gravel you, ere the moon set and the dawn break!"" So each came up to her in turn and she grounded them forthright, and pinioned them with their girdles, and ceased not wrestling and pitching them until she had overthrown one and all. Then there turned to her an old woman who was before her, and the beldam said as in wrath, ""O strumpet, cost thou glory in grounding these girls? Behold I am an old woman, yet have I thrown them forty times! So what hast thou to boast of? But if thou have the strength to wrestle with me, stand up that I may grip thee and set thy head between thy heels!"" The young lady smiled at her words, but she was filled with inward wrath, and she jumped up and asked, ""O my lady Zat al-Dawahi, by the truth of the Messiah, wilt thou wrestle with me in very deed, or dost thou jest with me?""; and she answered, ""Yea,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Forty-seventh Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the young lady asked Zat al-Dawahi, ""By the truth of the Messiah, wilt wrestle with me or dost jest?"", and she answered, ""Yea, I will wrestle with thee in very deed"" (Sharrkan looking on the while), the damsel cried, ""Rise up for the fall an thou have spunk so to do."" When the old woman heard this, she raged with exceeding rage, and her body hair stood on end like the bristles of a fretful hedgehog. Then she sprang to her feet, whilst the damsel stood up to her, and said, ""Now by the truth of the Messiah, I will not wrestle with thee unless I be naked, Mistress whore!"" So she loosed her petticoat trousers and, putting her hand under her clothes, tore them off her body; then twisted up a silken kerchief into cord shape, girt it round her middle and became as she were a scald head If ritah or a spotted snake. With this she inclined towards the damsel and said, ""Do thou as I have done."" All this time, Sharrkan was gazing at the twain, and laughing at the beldam's loathly semblance. So the damsel leisurely rose and, taking a sash of Yamani stuff, passed it twice round her waist, then she tucked up her trousers and displayed two calves of alabaster carrying a mound of crystal, smooth and rounded, and a stomach which exhaled musk from its dimples, as it were a bed of Nu'uman's anemones; and breasts like double pomegranates. Then the old woman leant towards her, and the two laid hold either of each, while Sharrkan raised his head Heavenwards and prayed Allah that the belle might beat the beldam. Presently the young woman get beneath the old woman; and, gripping her waist cloth with the left and circling her neck with the right hand, hoisted her off the ground with both; whereupon the old woman strove to free herself and, in so doing fell on her back arsiversy, with her legs high in air and her hairy bush between them showed manifest in the moonshine; furthermore she let fly two great farts one of which blew up the dust from the earth's face and the other steamed up to the gate of Heaven. Sharrkan laughed till he fell back upon the ground. Then he arose and, baring his brand looked right and left, but he saw no one save the old woman sprawling on her back, and said to himself, ""He lied not who named thee Lady of Calamities! Verily thou knewest her prowess by her performance upon the others."" So he drew near them to hear what should pass between them. Then the young lady went up to the old one and, throwing a wrapper of thin silk upon her nakedness, helped her to don her clothes and made excuses saying, ""O my lady Zat al- Dawahi, I intended only to throw thee and not all this, but thou triedst to twist out of my hands; so laud to Allah for safety!"" She returned her no answer, but rose in her shame and walked away till out of sight, leaving the handmaids prostrate and pinioned, with the fair damsel standing amongst them. Quoth Sharrkan to himself, ""Every luck hath its cause. Sleep did not fall upon me nor the war horse bear me hither save for my good fortune; for doubtless this maid and what is with her shall become booty to me."" So he made towards his steed and mounted and heeled him on, when he sped as the shaft speeds from the bow and in his hand he still hent his brand bare of sheath, which he brandished shouting the while his war cry, ""Allah is All mighty!"" When the damsel saw him she sprang to her feet and, taking firm stand on the bank of the stream, whose breadth was six ells, the normal cubits, made one bound and landed clear on the farther side, where she turned and cried out with a loud voice, ""Who art thou, O thou fellow, that breakest in upon our privacy and pastime, and that too hanger in hand as if charging a host? Whence camest thou and whither art thou going? Speak sooth, for truth will stand thee in good stead, and lie not, for lies come of villein breed Doubtless thou hast wandered this night from thy way, that thou chancedst upon this place whence escape were the greatest of mercies; for thou art now in an open plain and, did we shout but a single shout, would come to our rescue four thousand knights. So tell me what thou wantest; and if thou wouldst only have us set thee on the right road, we will do so."" When Sharrkan heard her words he replied, ""I am a stranger of the Moslems, who fared forth this night single handed, seeking for spoil; nor could this moonlight show me a fairer booty than these ten maidens; so I shall seize them and rejoin my comrades with them."" Quoth she, ""I would have thee know that as for the booty thou hast not come at it; and, as for the handmaids, by Allah, they shall never be thy spoil. Have I not told thee that to lie is villein vile?"" Quoth he, ""The wise man is he who taketh warning by others."" Thereupon quoth she, ""By the truth of the Messiah, did I not fear that thy death would be on my hands, I would shout a shout should fill the mead for thee with war steeds and with men of might, but I take pity upon the stranger. So, if thou seek booty, I require of thee that thou alight from thy steed and swear to me, by thy faith, that thou wilt not advance against me aught like arms in hand, and we will wrestle, I and thou. If thou throw me, set me on thy steed and take all of us to thy booty; but if I throw thee, thou shalt become under my command. Swear this to me, for I fear thy treachery: indeed it hath become a common saw, 'Where Perfidy is innate there Trust is a weakly mate.' Now an thou wilt swear I will return and draw near to thee and tackle thee."" Answered Sharrkan (and indeed he lusted to seize her and said in his soul, ""Truly she knoweth not that I am a champion of champions""); ""Swear me by what oath thou wilt and by what thou deemest most binding, and I will not approach thee with aught till thou hast made thy preparation and sayest, 'Draw near that I wrestle with thee.' If thou throw me, I have money where withal to ransom myself; and if I throw thee, 'twill be booty and booty enough for me!"" Rejoined the damsel, ""I am content herewith!"" and Sharrkan was astounded at her words and said, ""And by the truth of the Apostle (whom Allah bless and keep!) I too am content on the other part!"" Then said she, ""Swear to me by Him who sprite in body dight and dealt laws to rule man kind aright, that thou wilt not offer me aught of violence save by way of wrestling; else mayst thou die without the pale of Al- Islam."" Sharrkan replied, ""By Allah! were a Kazi to swear me, even though he were a Kazi of the Kazis, he would not impose upon me such an oath as this!"" Then he sware to her by all she named and tied his steed to a tree; but he was drowned in the sea of thought, saying in himself, ""Praise be to Him who fashioned her from dirty water!"" Then he girt himself and made ready for wrestling, and said to her, ""Cross the stream to me;"" but she replied, ""It is not for me to come over to thee: if thou wilt, pass thou over here to me."" ""I cannot do that,"" quoth he, and quoth she, ""O boy, I will come across to thee."" So she tucked up her skirts and, leaping, landed on the other side of the stream by his side; whereupon he drew near to her and bent him forwards and clapped palms. But he was confounded by her beauty and loveliness; for he saw a shape which the Hand of Power had tanned with the dye leaves of the Jann, which had been fostered by the Hand of Beneficence and fanned by the Zephyrs of fair fortune and whose birth a propitious ascendant had greeted. Then she called out to him, ""O Moslem, come on and let us wrestle ere the break of morning,"" and tucked up her sleeves from a forearm like fresh curd, which illumined the whole place with its whiteness; and Sharrkan was dazzled by it. Then he bent forwards and clapped his palms by way of challenge, she doing the like, and caught hold of her, and the two grappled and gripped and interlocked hands and arms. Presently he shifted his hands to her slender waist, when his finger tips sank into the soft folds of her middle, breeding languishment, and he fell a trembling like the Persian reed in the roaring gale. So she lifted him up and, throwing him to the ground, sat upon his breast with hips and hinder cheeks like mounds of sand, for his soul had lost mastery over his senses. Then she asked him, ""O Moslem! the slaying of Nazarenes is lawful to you folk; what then hast thou to say about being slain thyself?""; and he answered, ""O my lady, thy speech as regards slaying me is not other than unlawful; for our prophet Mohammed (whom Allah bless and preserve!) prohibited the slaying of women and children, old men and monks!"" ""As it was thus revealed to your Prophet,"" she replied, ""it behoveth us to render the equivalent of his mercy; so rise. I give thee thy life, for generosity is never lost upon the generous."" Then she got off his breast and he rose and stood shaking the dust from his head against the owners of the curved rib, even women; and she said to him, ""Be not ashamed; but verily one who entereth the land of Roum in quest of booty, and cometh to assist Kings against Kings, how happeneth it that he hath not strength enough to defend himself from one made out of the curved rib?"" ""'Twas not for lack of strength in me,"" he answered; ""nor didst thou throw me by thy force; it was thy loveliness overthrew me; so if thou wilt grant me another bout, it will be of thy courtesy."" She laughed and said, ""I grant thee thy request: but these handmaids have long been pinioned and their arms and sides are weary, and it were only right I should loose them, for haply this next wrestling bout will be long."" Then she went to the slave girls and, unbinding them, said to them in the tongue of Greece, ""Get ye to some safe place, till I foil this Moslem's lust and longing for you."" So they went away, whilst Sharrkan kept gazing at them and they kept turning to look at the two. Then each approached the adversary and he set his breast against hers, but when he felt waist touch waist, his strength failed him; and she, waxing ware of this, lifted him with her hands swiftlier than the blinding leven-flash, and threw him to the ground. He fell on his back, and then she said to him, ""Rise: I give thee thy life a second time. I spared thee in the first count because of thy Prophet, for that he made unlawful the slaying of women; and I do so on the second count because of thy weakliness and the greenness of thine years and thy strangerhood; but I charge thee, if there be in the Moslem army sent by Omar bin al-Nu'uman to succour the King of Constantinople, a stronger than thou, send him hither and tell him of me: for in wrestling there are shifts and trips, catches and holds, such as the feint or falsing and the snap or first grip, the hug, the feet-catch, the thigh Lite, the jostle and the leg-lock."" ""By Allah, O my lady,"" quoth Sharrkan (and indeed he was highly incensed against her), ""had I been Master al-Safdí, Master Mohammed Kimál or Ibn al-Saddí, as they were in their prime, I had kept no note of these shifts thou mentionest; for O my mistress, by Allah, thou hast not grassed me by thy strength, but by the blandishments of thy back parts; for we men of Mesopotamia so love a full formed thigh that nor sense was left me nor foresight. But now, an thou wish, thou shalt try a third fall with me while my wits are about me, and this last match is allowed me by the laws of the game which sayeth the best of three: moreover I have regained my presence of mind."" When she heard his words she said to him, ""Hast thou not had a belly full of this wrestling, O vanquished one? However come on, an thou wilt; but know that this must be the last round."" Then she bent forward and challenged him and Sharrkan did likewise, setting to it in real earnest and being right cautious about the throw: so the two strove awhile and the damsel found in him a strength such as she had not observed before and said to him, ""O Moslem, thou art now on thy mettle."" ""Yes,"" he replied, ""thou knowest that there remaineth to me but this one round, after which each of us will wend a different way."" She laughed and he laughed too; then she overreached at his thigh and caught firm hold of it unawares, which made him greet the ground and fall full on his back. She laughed at him and said, ""Art thou an eater of bran? Thou are like a Badawi's bonnet which falleth off with every touch or else the Father of Winds that droppeth before a puff of air. Fie upon thee, O thou poor thing!"" adding, ""Get thee back to the Moslem army and send us other than thyself, for thou fairest of thews; and proclaim for us, among the Arabs and Persians, the Turks and Daylamites, whoso hath might in him, let him come to us."" Then she made a spring and landed on the other side of the stream and said to Sharrkan, laughing, ""Parting with thee is right grievous to me, O my lord; but get thee to thy mates before dawn, lest the Knights come upon thee and pick thee up on their lance points. Thou hast no strength to defend thee against a woman, so how couldst thou hold thine own amongst men of might and Knights?"" Sharrkan was confounded and called to her (as she turned from him making towards the convent), ""O my lady, wilt thou go away and leave the miserable stranger, the broken hearted slave of love?"" So she turned to him laughing and said, ""What is thy want? I will grant thee thy prayer."" ""Have I set foot in thy country and tasted the sweetness of thy courtesy,"" replied he, ""and shall I return without eating of thy victual and tasting thy hospitality; I who have become one of thy servitors!"" ""None baulk kindliness save the base,"" she rejoined, ""honour us in Allah's name, on my head and eyes be it! Mount thy steed and ride along the brink of the stream over against me, for now thou art my guest."" At this Sharrkan was glad and, hastening back to his horse, mounted and walked him abreast of her, and she kept faring on till they came to a drawbridge built of beams of the white poplar, hung by pullies and steel chains and made fast with hooks and padlocks. When Sharrkan looked, he saw awaiting her upon the bridge the same ten handmaids whom she had thrown in the wrestling bouts; and, as she came up to them, she said to one in the Greek tongue, ""Arise and take the reins of his horse and conduct him across into the convent."" So she went up to Sharrkan and led him over, much puzzled and perturbed with what he saw, and saying to himself, ""O would that the Wazir Dandan were here with me that his eyes might look upon these fairest of favours."" Then he turned to the young lady and said to her, ""O marvel of loveliness, now I have two claims upon thee; first the claim of good fellowship, and secondly for that thou hast carried me to thy home and offered me thy hospitality. I am now under thy commandance and thy guidance; so do me one last favour by accompanying me to the lands of Al-Islam; where thou shalt look upon many a lion hearted warrior and thou shalt learn who I am."" When she heard this she was angered and said to him, ""By the truth of the Messiah, thou hast proved thyself with me a man of keen wit; but now I see what mischief there is in thy heart, and how thou canst permit thyself a speech which proveth thy traitorous intent. How should I do as thou sayest, when I wot that if I came to that King of yours, Omar bin al- Nu'uman, I should never get free from him? For truly he hath not the like of me or behind his city walls or within his palace halls, Lord of Baghdad and of Khorasan though he be, who hath built for himself twelve pavilions, in number as the months of the year, and in each a concubine after the number of the days; and if I come to him he would not prove shy of me, for your folk believe I am lawful to have and to hold as is said in your writ, 'Or those women whom your right hand shall possess as slaves.' So how canst thou speak thus to me? As for thy saying, 'Thou shalt look upon the braves of the Moslems,' by the truth of the Messiah, thou sayest that which is not true, for I saw your army when it reached our land, these two days ago; and I did not see that your ordinance was the ordinance of Kings, but I beheld only a rabble of tribesmen gathered together. And as to thy words, 'Thou shalt know who I am,' I did not do thee kindness because of thy dignity but out of pride in myself; and the like of thee should not talk thus to the like of me, even wert thou Sharrkan, Omar bin al- Nu'uman's son, the prowess name in these days!"" ""Knowest thou Sharrkan?"" asked he; and she answered Yes! and I know of his coming with an army numbering ten thousand horsemen; also that he was sent by his sire with this force to gain prevalence for the King of Constantinople."" ""O my lady,"" said Sharrkan, ""I adjure thee by thy religion, tell me the cause of all this, that sooth may appear to me clear of untruth, and with whom the fault lies."" ""Now by the virtue of thy faith,"" she replied, ""did I not fear lest the news of me be bruited abroad that I am of the daughters of Roum, I would adventure myself and sally forth single handed against the ten thousand horsemen and slay their leader, the Wazir Dandan and vanquish their champion Sharrkan. Nor would aught of shame accrue to me thereby, for I have read books and studied the rules of good breeding in the language of the Arabs. But I have no need to vaunt my own prowess to thee, more by token as thou hast proved in thy proper person my skill and strength in wrestling; and thou hast learnt my superiority over other women. Nor, indeed, had Sharrkan himself been here this night and it were said to him, 'Clear this stream,' could he have done it; and I only long and lust that the Messiah would throw him into my hands in this very convent, that I might go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes.""- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Forty-eighth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Nazarene damsel said to Sharrkan (and he listening impatiently enow), ""Verily if Sharrkan fell into my hands, I would go forth to him in the habit of a man and drag him from his saddle seat and make him my captive and lay him in bilboes,"" pride and passion and knightly jealousy took possession of him and he desired to discover and declare himself and to lay on load; but her loveliness restrained him and he began repeating,
""An faulty of one fault the Beauty prove, * Her charms a thousand advocates shall move.""
So she went up and Sharrkan after her; and, when he saw the maiden's back and hinder cheeks that clashed against each other, like rollers in the rolling sea, he extemporised these couplets:- -
""For her sins is a pleader that brow, * And all hearts its fair
             pleading must bow:
When I saw it I cried, ""To night * The moon at its fullest doth
            show;
Tho' Balkis' own Ifrit try a bout, * Spite his force she
            would deal him a throw.""
The two fared on till they reached a gate over which rose a marble archway. This she opened and ushered Sharrkan into a long vestibule, vaulted with ten connected arches, from each of which hung a crystal lamp glistening like a spark of fire. The handmaids met her at the further end bearing wax candles of goodly perfume, and wearing on their heads golden fillets crusted with all manner bezel gems, and went on before her (Sharrkan still following), till they reached the inner convent. There the Moslem saw couches and sofas ranged all around, one opposite the other and all over hung with curtains flowered in gold. The monastery floor was paved with every kind of vari coloured marbles and mosaic work, and in the midst stood a basin that held four and twenty jetting fountains of gold, whence the water ran like molten silver; whilst at the upper end stood a throne spread with silks fit only for Kings. Then said the damsel, ""Ascend, O my lord, this throne."" So he went up to it and sat down and she withdrew to remain absent for some time. Sharrkan asked of her from one of the servants who answered him, ""She hath gone to her dormitory; but we will serve thee even as she ordered."" So they set before him viands of rare varieties, and he ate his sufficiency, when they brought him a basin of gold and an ewer of silver, and he washed his hands. Then his thoughts reverted to his army, knowing not what had befallen it in his absence and calling to mind also how he had forgotten his father's injunctions: so he was troubled about his case, repenting of what he had done till the dawn broke and the day appeared; when he lamented and sighed and became drowned in sea of sadness and repeated,
""I am not lost to prudence, but indeed * Here I'm bewildered,
            what shall be my rede?
Would any aid me in mine ails of love, * By my own might and
            sleight would I be free'd:
But ah! my heart is lost and passion-shent: * To none save Allah
          can I trust my need!""
When he ended his verse behold, there came up to him a rare show and a fair, more than twenty maidens like crescents encompassing the young lady, who shone in their midst as the full moon among the constellations guarding and girding her. She was clad in brocades befitting Kings; her breasts were like twin pomegranates, a woven zone set with all kinds of jewels tightly clasped her waist which expanded below into jutting hips; and her hinder cheeks stood out as a mound of crystal supporting a silvern shaft. When Sharrkan looked at her his wits went nigh to fly away from him with delight; and he forgot army and Wazir as he gazed on her fair head decked and dight with a net work of pearls set off by divers sorts of gems. Handmaids on her right and handmaids on her left bore her train, as she paced with dainty graceful gait in all the pride of seemlihead. He sprang to his feet seeing such beauty and loveliness, and cried aloud, ""Beware and beware of that zone rarely fair!"" and broke out into these couplets,
""With heavy back parts, high breasts delicate, * And lissome form
           that sways with swimming gait
She deftly hides love longing in her breast; * But I may never
           hide its ban and bate
While hosts of followers her steps precede, * Like pearls
            now necklaced and now separate.""
She gazed upon him for a long time and considered him till she was assured of him, when she came up to him and said, ""In very sooth the place is honoured and illumined by thee, O Sharrkan! How sped thy night, O hero, after we went away and left thee?""; adding, ""Verily lying is a vile thing and a shameful, especially in great Kings! and thou art Crown Prince Sharrkan, son and heir of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; so henceforth make no secret of thy rank and condition, nor let me hear aught from thee but the truth; for leasing bequeatheth hate and despite. And as thou art pierced by the shaft of Fate, be resignation thine and abide content to wait."" When he heard her words he saw that artifice availed him naught and he acknowledged the truth, saying, ""I am Sharrkan, bin Omar bin al-Nu'uman, whom fortune hath afflicted and cast into this place; so whatso thou willest, do it in my case!"" She hung her head groundwards a long while, then turned to him and said, ""Be of good cheer and let thine eyes be cool and clear; for thou art the guest of my hospitality, and bread and salt hath made a tie between me and thee; wherefore thou art in my ward and under my safeguard. Have no fear for, by the truth of the Messiah, if all on earth sought to do thee hurt they should not come at thee, till life had left my body for thy sake: indeed thou art now under the charge of the Messiah and of me."" Hereat she sat her down by his side and fell to playing with him, till his alarm subsided and he knew that had she desired to slay him, she would have done so during the past night. Presently she bespoke in the Grecian tongue one of her slave girls, who went away and soon came back bringing a beaker and a tray of food; but Sharrkan abstained from eating and said to himself, ""Haply she hath put somewhat in this meat."" She knew what was in his thought; so she turned to him and said, ""By the truth of the Messiah, the case is not on such wise, nor is there aught in this meat of what thou suspectest! Had my mind been set on slaying thee, I had slain thee ere now."" Then she walked up to the tray and ate of every dish a mouthful; where upon Sharrkan came forward and ate too. She was pleased at this and both ate till they were satisfied. They washed their hands and after that she rose and ordered a handmaid to bring perfumes and herbs of sweet savour, wines of all colours and kinds and a wine-service with vessels of gold, silver and crystal. She filled a first goblet and drank it off before offering it to him, even as she had done with the food: then she crowned a second and handed it to him. He drank and she said to him, ""O Moslem, see how thou art here in all solace and delight of life!"" And she ceased not to drink and ply him with drink, till he took leave of his wits,- -And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day, and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Forty-ninth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the damsel ceased not to drink and ply Sharrkan with drink till he took leave of his wits, for the wine and the intoxication of love he bore her. Presently she said to the slave girl, ""O Marjanah! bring us some instruments of music!"" ""To hear is to obey,"" said the hand maid and going out, returned in the twinkling of an eye with a Damascus lute, a Persian harp, a Tartar pipe, and an Egyptian dulcimer. The young lady took the lute and, after tuning each several string, began in gentle undersong to sing, softer than zephyr's wing and sweeter than Tasmin spring, with heart safe and secure from everything the couplets following,
""Allah assain those eyne! What streams of blood they shed! * How
           many an arrowy glance those lids of thine have sped.
I love all lovers who to lovers show them cure; * 'Twere wrong to
           rue the love in wrong head born and bred:
Haply fall hapless eye for thee no sleeping kens! * Heaven help
          the hapless heart by force of thee misled!
Thou doomest me to death who art my king, and I * Ransom with
          life the deemster who would doom me dead.""
Thereupon each and every of the maidens rose up and taking an instrument, played and recited couplets in the Roumi tongue; then their mistress sang also and seeing Sharrkan in ecstasies asked him, ""O Moslem, dost thou understand what I say?""; and he answered, ""Nay, my ecstasy cometh from the beauty of thy finger sips."" She laughed and continued, ""If I sing to thee in Arabic what wouldst thou do?"" ""I should no longer,"" quoth he, ""be master of my senses."" Then she took an instrument and, changing the measure, began singing these verses,
""The smack of parting's myrrh to me, * How, then, bear patience'
            aloë?
I'm girt by ills in trinity * Severance, distance,
             cruelty!
My freedom stole that fairest she, * And parting irks me
            bitterly.""
When she ended her verse, she looked at Sharrkan and found him lost to existence, and he lay for a while stretched at full length and prone among the maidens. Then he revived and, remembering the songs, again inclined to mirth and merriment; and the twain returned to their wine and wassail, and continued their playing and toying, their pastime and pleasure till day ceased illuminating and night drooped her wing. Then the damsel went off to her dormitory and when Sharrkan asked after her they answered, ""She is gone to her sleeping chamber,"" whereto he rejoined, ""Under Allah's ward and His good guard!"" As soon as it was morning, a handmaid came to him and said to him, ""My mistress biddeth thee to her."" So he rose and followed her and, as he drew near her lodging, the damsels welcomed him with smitten tabrets and songs of greeting, and led him through a great door of ivory studded with pearls and jewels. Thence they passed with him into a tall and spacious hall, at the upper end of which was a wide dais carpeted with all kinds of silks, and round it open lattices commanding a view of trees and streams. About the saloon were figures carved in human form, and fashioned on such wise that the air passed through them and set in motion musical instruments within, so that the beholder would fancy they spoke. Here sat the young lady, looking at the figures; but when she saw Sharrkan, she sprang to her feet and, taking him by the hand, made him sit down by her side, and asked him how he had passed the night. He blessed her and the two sat talking awhile till she asked him, ""Knowest thou aught touching lovers and slaves of love?""; and he answered ""Yes! I wot somewhat in verse on that matter."" ""Let me hear it,"" quoth she, so he began quoting,
""Pleasure and health, good cheer, good appetite * To Azzah,
           freest with our name and fame!
By Allah! would I near her off she flies * At tangent, granting
           less the more I claim:
I dote on Azzah, but when clear I off * My rivals, clears me too
           that dearest dame;
Like wandering wight that chose for shade a cloud * Which, ere
            siesta done, thin air became.""
When she heard this she said, ""Verily Al-Kuthayyir was conspicuous for sweet speech and chaste, and he was superlative in his praise of Azzah when he sang"" (and she began to recite),
""Did Azzah deal behest to Sun o' noon, * The judge had judged her
             beauty's bestest boon;
And girls who come to me and carp at her, * God make their rosy
           cheeks her sandal-shoon!
And indeed,"" quoth she, ""'twas said that Azzah boasted exceeding beauty and loveliness."" Then she asked Sharrkan saying, ""O Prince, cost thou know aught of Jamil's verses to Buthaynah? if so repeat to us somewhat of them;"" and he answered, ""Yes, I know them better than any;"" whereupon he began repeating these couplets,
""Jamil, in Holy war go fight!"" to me they say: * What war save
            fight for fair ones would I e'er essay?
To me their every word and work are mere delight, * And martyrs
           crepe I all they slay in fight and fray:
An ask I, 'O Buthaynah! what's this love, I pray, * Which eats
            my heart?' quoth she ' 'Twill stay for ever and aye!'
And when I cry, 'Of wits return some small display * For daily
            use,' quoth she, 'Far, far 'tis fled away!
Thou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy * While I
             no goal espy save thee and thee alway.'""
""Thou hast spoken right well,"" said she, ""O King's son, and Jamil also spoke excellently well. But what would Buthaynah have done with him that he saith in his hemistich,
'Thou seekst my death; naught else thy will can satisfy?'""
""O my lady,"" quoth Sharrkan, ""she willed to do him what thou willest to do with me, and even that will not satisfy thee."" She laughed at his opportune reply and they ceased not carousing till Day put out her light and Night came in darkness dight. Then she rose and went to her dormitory and slept, while Sharrkan slept in his place till morning dawned. As soon as he awoke, the hand maids came to him with tabrets and other instruments of mirth and merriment, as wont; and, kissing the ground between his hands, said to him, ""Bismillah! in Allah's name be so kind as to come: our mistress biddeth thee to her presence!"" So he rose and accompanied the slave girls who surrounded him, playing on tabrets and other instruments of music, till they passed from that saloon into another and a yet more spacious hall, decorated with pictured likenesses and figures of birds and beasts, passing all description. Sharrkan marvelled at the art and artifice of the place and began reciting,
""He plucks fruits of her necklace in rivalry, * And her breast-
           pearls that bedded in gold mine lie.
Pure water on silvern bars is her brow, * And her cheeks show
             roses with rubies vie:
Meseems in her eyne that the violet's hue * Lies purpling set in
            the Ithmid's dye.""
When the lady saw Sharrkan, she stood up to him in honour and,
taking his hand, seated him by her side and asked, ""O son of King
Omar bin al-Nu'uman, hast thou any cunning in the game of chess?""
""Yes,"" he answered, ""but do not thou with me as said the poet,
'I speak and longing love upties me and unties me; * Till with
             her honey dew of inner lip she plies me:
I brought the chess board and my liefest lover plays me * With
            white and black, but black cum white ne'er satisfies
             me:
'Twas as if King for Castle I were fain to place me * Till wilful
             loss of game atwixt two queens surprise me:
And if I seek to read intent in eyes that eye me * Oh man! that
             glance askance with hint of wish defies me.'""
Then she brought the chessboard and played with him; but Sharrkan, instead of looking at her moves, kept gazing at her fair mouth, and putting knight in place of elephant and elephant instead of knight. She laughed and said to him, ""If thy play be after this fashion, thou knowest naught of the game."" ""This is only our first,"" replied he, ""judge not by this bout."" When she beat him he replaced the pieces in position and played again with her; but she beat him a second time, a third, a fourth and a fifth. So she turned to him and said, ""Thou art beaten in everything;"" and he replied, ""O my lady, how should one playing with the like of thee avoid being beaten?"" Then she bade bring food, and they ate and washed their hands; after which the wine was set before them and they drank. Presently, she took the dulcimer, for her hand was cunning in smiting it, and she began repeating to an accompaniment these couplets,
""Twixt the close tied and open wide no medium Fortune knoweth, *
            Now ebb and flow then flow and ebb this wise her likeness
             showeth.
Then drink her wine the syne she's thine and smiling thou dost
             find her * Anon she'll fall and fare away when all thy good
             forth goeth.""
They ceased not to carouse till nightfall and this day was pleasanter even than the first. When darkness set in, the lady betook her to her dormitory, leaving him alone with the hand maids; so he threw himself on the ground and slept till dawn, when the damsels came to him with tambourines and other instruments according to custom. Seeing them he roused him hastily and sat up; and they carried him to their mistress, who came to meet him and, taking him by the hand, seated him by her side. Then she asked him how he had passed his night, whereat he prayed that her life be prolonged; and she took the lute and sang to it these verses which she improvised,
""Ne'er incline thee to part * Which embitters the heart
E'en the sun when he sets * Shall in pallor depart.""
While they were solacing themselves after this fashion, behold, there arose a great and sudden clamour, and a confused crowd of knights and men rushed in, holding drawn swords that glittered and gleamed in their hands, and cried aloud in the Grecian tongue ""Thou hast fallen into our hands, O Sharrkan, so make thee sure of death!"" When he heard this, he said to himself, ""By Allah, she hath entrapped me and held me in play, till her men should come. These are the Knights with whom she threatened me; but 'tis I who have thrown myself into this strait."" Then he turned towards the young lady to reproach her, but saw that she had changed colour and her face was pale; and she sprang to her feet and asked the crowd, ""Who are ye?"" ""O most gracious Princess and peerless onion pearl,"" answered the leading Knight, ""dost thou weet who is yon man by thy side?"" ""Not I,"" she replied, ""who may he be?"" Quoth the Patrician, ""This is of towns the highwayman! This is he who rideth in the horseman's van! This is Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman! This is he that forceth fortalice and penetrateth every impregnable place! The news of him reached King Hardub, thy father, by report of the ancient dame Zat al- Dawahi; and thy sire, our sovereign, hath made sure that thou hast rendered good service to the army of the Greeks by taking captive this ominous lion."" When she heard this, she looked at the Knight and asked him, ""What be thy name?"" and he answered, ""I am Másúrah, son of thy slave Mausúrah bin Káshardah, Knight of Knights."" ""And how?"" quoth she, ""durst thou enter my presence without leave?"" Quoth he, ""O my lady, when I came to the gate, none forbade me, neither chamberlain nor porter, but all the door keepers rose and forewent us as of wont; although, when others come, they leave them standing at the gate while they ask permission to admit them. But this is not a time for long talking, when the King is expecting our return with this Prince, the scorpion sting of the Islamitic host, that he may kill him and drive back his men whither they came, without the bane of battling with them."" ""These words be ill words,"" rejoined the Princess, ""and Dame Zat al-Dawahi lied, avouching an idle thing and a vain, whereof she weeteth not the truth; for by the virtue of the Messiah, this man who is with me is not Sharrkan, nor is he a captive, but a stranger who came to us seeking our hospitality, and I made him my guest. So even were we assured that this be Sharrkan and were it proved to us that it is he beyond a doubt, I say it would ill befit mine honour that I should deliver into your hands one who hath entered under my protection. So make me not a traitor to my guest and a disgrace among men; but return to the King, my father, and kiss the ground before him, and inform him that the case is contrariwise to the report of the Lady Zat al-Dawahi."" ""O Abrízah,"" replied Masurah, the Knight, ""I cannot return to the King's majesty without his debtor and enemy."" Quoth she (and indeed she had waxed very wroth). ""Out on thee! Return to him with my answer, and no blame shall befal thee!"" Quoth Masurah, ""I will not return without him."" Thereupon her colour changed and she exclaimed, ""Exceed not in talk and vain words; for verily this man had not come in to us, were he not assured that he could of himself and single handed make head against an hundred riders; and if I said to him, 'Thou art Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman,' he would answer, 'Yes.' But 'tis not of your competence to let or hinder him; for if you do so, he will not turn back from you till he hath slain all that are in this place. Behold, here he is by my side, and I will bring him before you sword and targe in hand."" ""Albeit I were safe from thy wrath,"" answered Masurah the Knight, ""I am not safe from that of thy father, and when I see him, I shall sign to the Knights to take him captive, and we will carry him to the King bound and in abject sort."" When she heard this, she said, ""The matter shall not pass thus, for 'twould be blazoning mere folly. This man is but one and ye are an hundred Knights: so if you would attack him come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiant amongst you.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Fiftieth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Abrizah said to the Knight, ""This man is but one, and ye are an hundred: so if ye would attack him, come out against him, one after one, that it may appear to the King which is the valiant."" Quoth Masurah, the Knight, ""By the truth of the Messiah, thou sayest sooth, and none but I shall sally out against him first."" Quoth she, ""Wait till I go to him and acquaint him with the case and hear what answer he will make. If he consent, 'tis well; but if he refuse, ye shall on no wise come to him, for I and my hand maids and whosoever is in the convent will be his ransom."" So she went to Sharrkan and told him the news, whereat he smiled and knew that she had not informed any of the Emirs; but that tidings of him had been bruited and blazed abroad, till the report reached the King, against her wish and intent. So he again began reproaching himself and said, ""How came I to adventure and play with my life by coming to the country of the Greeks?"" But hearing the young lady's proposal he said to her, ""Indeed their onset, one after one, would be overburdensome to them. Will they not come out against me, ten by ten?"" ""That would be villainy,"" said she; ""Let one have at one."" When he heard this, he sprang to his feet and made for them with his sword and battle gear; and Masurah, the Knight, also sprang up and bore down upon him. Sharrkan met him like a lion and delivered a shoulder cut which clove him to the middle, and the blade came out gleaming and glittering from his back and bowels. When the lady beheld that swashingblow, Sharrkan's might was magnified in her sight and she knew that when she overthrew him in the wrestle it was not by her strength but by her beauty and loveliness. So she turned to the Knights and said, ""Take wreak for your chief!"" Thereupon out came the slain man's brother, a fierce and furious Knight, and rushed upon Sharrkan, who delayed not, but smote him also with the shoulder cut and the sword came out glittering from his vitals. Then cried the Princess, ""O ye servants of the Messiah, avenge your comrade!"" So they ceased not charging down upon him, one after one; and Sharrkan also ceased not playing upon them with the blade, till he had slain fifty Knights, the lady looking on the while. And Allah cast a panic into the hearts of the survivors, so that they held back and dared not meet him in the duello, but fell upon him in a body; and he laid on load with heart firmer than a rock, and smote them and trod them down like straw under the threshing sled, till he had driven sense and soul out of them. Then the Princess called aloud to her damsels, saying, ""Who is left in the convent?""; and they replied, ""None but the gate keepers;"" whereupon she went up to Sharrkan and took him to her bosom, he doing the same, and they returned to the palace, after he had made an end of the melee. Now there remained a few of the Knights hiding from him in the cells of the monastery, and when the Princess saw this she rose from Sharrkan's side and left him for a while, but presently came back clad in closely meshed coat of ring mail and holding in her hand a fine Indian scymitar. And she said, ""Now by the truth of the Messiah, I will not be a niggard of myself for my guest; nor will I abandon him though for this I abide a reproach and a by word in the land of the Greeks."" Then she took reckoning of the dead and found that he had slain fourscore of the Knights, and other twenty had taken to flight. When she saw what work he had made with them she said to him, ""Allah bless thee, O Sharrkan! The Cavaliers may well glory in the like of thee."" Then he rose and wiping his blade clean of the blood of the slain began reciting these couplets,
""How oft in the mellay I've cleft the array, * And given their
             bravest to lions a prey:
Ask of me and of them when I proved me prow * O'er creation, on
             days of the foray and fray:
When I left in the onslaught their lions to lie * On the sands of
             the low lands in fieriest day.""
When he ended his verse, the Princess came up to him with smiles and kissed his hand; then she doffed her hauberk and he said to her, ""O lady mine, wherefore didst thou don that coat of mail and bare thy brand?"" ""To guard thee against these caitiffs,"" she replied. Then she summoned the gate keepers and asked them, ""How came ye to admit the King's Knights into my dwelling without leave of me?""; and they answered, ""O Princess, it is not our custom to ask leave of thee for the King's messengers, and especially for the chief of his Knights."" Quoth she, ""I think ye were minded only to disgrace me and murder my guest;"" and bade Sharrkan smite their necks. He did so and she cried to the rest of her servants, ""Of a truth, they deserved even more than that!"" Then turning to Sharrkan, she said to him, ""Now that there hath become manifest to thee what was concealed, thou shalt be made acquainted with my history. Know, then, that I am the daughter of King Hardub of Roum; my name is Abrizah and the ancient dame, yclept Zat al-Dawahi, is my grandmother by the sword side. She it certainly is who told my father of thee, and as surely she will compass a sleight to slay me, more by token as thou hast slain my father's chivalry and it is noised abroad that I have separated myself from the Nazarenes and have become no better than I should be with the Moslems. Wherefore it were wiser that I leave this dwelling while Zat al-Dawahi is on my track; but I require of thee the like kindness and courtesy I have shown thee, for enmity will presently befal between me and my father on thine account. So do not thou neglect to do aught that I shall say to thee, remembering all this betided me not save by reason of thee."" Hearing her words, Sharrkan joyed greatly; his breast broadened and his wits flew from him for delight, and he said, ""By Allah, none shall come at thee, while life is in my bosom! But hast thou patience to bear parting from thy parents and thy people?"" ""Even so,"" she answered; and Sharrkan swore to her and the two plighted their troth. Then said she, ""Now is my heart at ease; but there remaineth one other condition for thee."" ""What is it?"" asked he and she answered, ""It is that thou return with thy host to thine own country."" Quoth he, ""O lady mine, my father, King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, sent me to wage war upon thy sire, on account of the treasure he plundered from the King of Constantinople, and amongst the rest three great jewels, noted givers of good fortune."" Quoth she, ""Cheer thy heart and clear thine eyes: I will tell thee the whole of the tale and the cause of our feud with the King of Constantinople. Know that we have a yearly festival, highs the Convent Feast, whereat Kings from all quarters and the noblest women are wont to congregate; thither also come merchants and traders with their wives and families, and the visitors abide there seven days. I was wont to be one of them; but, when there befel enmity between us, my father forbade me to be present at the festival for the space of seven years. One year, it chanced that amongst the daughters of the great who resorted to the patron, as was their custom, came a daughter of the King of Constantinople, a beautiful girl called Sophia. They tarried at the monastery six days and on the seventh the folk went their ways; but Sophia said, 'I will not return to Constantinople save by water.' So they equipped for her a ship in which she embarked with her suite; and making sail they put out to sea; but as they were voyaging behold, a contrary wind caught them and drove the vessel from her course till, as Fate and Fortune would have it, she fell in with a Nazarene craft from the Camphor Island carrying a crew of five hundred armed Franks, who had been cruising about a long time. When they sighted the sails of the ship, wherein Sophia and her women were, they gave chase in all haste and in less than an hour they came up with her, then they laid the grappling irons aboard her and captured her. Then taking her in tow they made all sail for their own island and were but a little distant from it when the wind veered round and, splitting their sails, drove them on to a shoal which lies off our coast. Thereupon we sallied forth and, looking on them as spoil driven to us by Fate, boarded and took them; and, slaying the men, made prize of the wreck, wherein we found the treasures and rarities in question and forty maidens, amongst whom was the King's daughter, Sophia. After the capture we carried the Princess and her women to my father, not knowing her to be a daughter of King Afridun of Constantinople; and he chose out for himself ten including her; and divided the rest among his dependents. Presently he set apart five damsels, amongst whom was the King s daughter, and sent them to thy father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, together with other gifts, such as broadcloth and woollen stuffs and Grecian silks. Thy father accepted them and chose out from amongst the five girls Sophia, daughter of King Afridun; nor did we hear more of her till the beginning of this year, when her father wrote to my father in words unfitting for me to repeat, rebuking him with menaces and saying to him: Two years ago, you plundered a ship of ours which had been seized by a band of Frankish pirates in which was my daughter, Sophia, attended by her maidens numbering some threescore. Yet ye informed me not thereof by messenger or otherwise; nor could I make the matter public, lest reproach befal me amongst the Kings, by reason of my daughter's honour. So I concealed my case till this year, when I wrote to certain Frankish corsairs and sought news of my daughter from the Kings of the Isles. They replied, 'By Allah we carried her not forth of thy realm; but we have heard that King Hardub rescued her from certain pirates. And they told me the whole tale.' Then he added in the writing which he writ to my father: 'Except you wish to be at feud with me and design to disgrace me and dishonour my daughter, you will, the instant my letter reacheth you, send my daughter back to me. But if you slight my letter and disobey my commandment, I will assuredly make you full return for your foul dealing and the baseness of your practices.' When my father read this letter and understood the contents, it vexed him and he regretted not having known that Sophia, King Afridun's daughter, was among the captured damsels, that he might have sent her back to her sire; and he was perplexed about the case because, after so long a time, he could not send to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and demand her back from him, especially as he had lately heard that Heaven had granted him boon of babe by this Sophia. So when we pondered that truth, we knew that this letter was none other than a grievous calamity; and my father found nothing for it but to write an answer to King Afridun, making his excuses and swearing to him by strong oaths that he knew not his daughter to be among the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth how he had sent her to King Omar bin al Nu'uman, who had gotten the blessing of issue by her. When my father's reply reached King Afridun he rose up and sat down, and roared and foamed at the mouth crying:—'What! shall he take captive my daughter and even her with slave girls and pass her on from hand to hand sending her for a gift to Kings, and they lie with her without marriage contract? By the Messiah and the true Faith,' said he, 'I will not desist till I have taken my blood vengeance for this and have wiped out my shame; and indeed I will do a deed which the chroniclers shall chronicle after me!' So he bided his time till he devised a device and laid notable toils and snares, when he sent an embassy to thy father, King Omar, to tell him that which thou hast heard: accordingly thy father equipped thee and an army with thee and sent thee to King Afridun, whose object is to seize thee and thine army to boot. As for the three jewels whereof he told thy father when asking his aid, there was not one soothfast word in that matter, for they were with Sophia, his daughter; and my father took them from her, when he got possession of her and of her maidens, and gave them to me in free gift, and they are now with me. So go thou to thy host and turn them back ere they be led deep into, and shut in by, the land of the bevy of damsels in the ship and setting forth the Franks and the country of the Greeks; for as soon as you have come far enough into their interior, they will stop the roads upon you and there will be no escape for you till the Day of retribution and retaliation. I know that thy troops are still halting where thou leftest them, because thou didst order a three days' rest; withal they have missed thee all this time and they wot not what to do."" When Sharrkan heard her words, he was absent awhile in thought; then he kissed Princess Abrizah's hand and said, ""Praise be to Allah who hath bestowed thee on me and appointed thee to be the cause of my salvation and the salvation of whoso is with me! But 'tis grievous to me to part from thee and I know not what will become of thee after my departure."" ""Go now to thine army,"" she replied, ""and turn them back, while ye are yet near your own country. If the envoys be still with them, lay hands on them and keep them, that the case may be made manifest to you; and, after three days, I will be with you all and we will enter Baghdad together."" As he turned to depart she said, ""Forget not the compact which is between me and thee,"" then she rose to bid him farewell and embrace him and quench the fire of desire, so she took leave of him and, throwing her arms round his neck, wept with exceeding weeping, and repeated these verses,
""I bade adieu, my right hand wiped my tears away, * The while my
             left hand held her in a close embrace:
'Fearest thou naught,' quoth she, 'of shame?' I answered 'Nay, *
             The lover's parting day is lover's worst disgrace.'""
Then Sharrkan left her and walked down from the convent. They brought his steed, so he mounted and rode down stream to the drawbridge which he crossed and presently threaded the woodland paths and passed into the open meadow. As soon as he was clear of the trees he was aware of horsemen which made him stand on the alert, and he bared his brand and rode cautiously, but as they drew near and exchanged curious looks he recognized them and behold, it was the Wazir Dandan and two of his Emirs. When they saw him and knew him, they dismounted and saluting him, asked the reason of his absence; whereupon he told them all that had passed between him and Princess Abrizah from first to last. The Wazir returned thanks to Almighty Allah for his safety and said, ""Let us at once leave these lands; for the envoys who came with us are gone to inform the King of our approach, and haply he will hasten to fall on us and take us prisoners."" So Sharrkan cried to his men to saddle and mount, which they did and, setting out at once, they stinted not faring till they reached the sole of the valley wherein the host lay. The Ambassadors meanwhile had reported Sharrkan's approach to their King, who forthright equipped a host to lay hold of him and those with him. But Sharrkan, escorted by the Wazir Dandan and the two Emirs, had no sooner sighted the army, than he raised the cry ""March! March!"" They took horse on the instant and fared through the first day and second and third day, nor did they cease faring for five days; at the end of which time they alighted in a well wooded valley, where they rested awhile. Then they again set out and stayed not riding for five and twenty days which placed them on the frontiers of their own country. Here, deeming themselves safe, they halted to rest; and the country people came out to them with guest gifts for the men and provender and forage for the beasts. They tarried there two days after which, as all would be making for their homes, Sharrkan put the Wazir Dandan in command, bidding him lead the host back to Baghdad. But he himself remained behind with an hundred riders, till the rest of the army had made one day's march: then he called ""To horse!"" and mounted with his hundred men. They rode on two parasangs' space till they arrived at a gorge between two mountains and lo! there arose before them a dark cloud of sand and dust. So they checked their steeds awhile till the dust opened and lifted, discovering beneath it an hundred cavaliers, lion faced and in mail coats cased. As soon as they drew within earshot of Sharrkan and his meiny they cried out to them, saying, ""By the virtue of John and Mary, we have won to our wish! We have been following you by forced marches, night and day, till we forewent you to this place. So dismount and lay down your arms and yield yourselves, that we may grant you your lives."" When Sharrkan heard this, his eyes stood out from his head and his cheeks flushed red and he said 'How is it, O. Nazarene dogs, ye dare enter our country and overmatch our land? And doth not this suffice you, but ye must adventure yourselves and address us in such unseemly speech? Do you think to escape out of our hands and return to your country?"" Then he shouted to his hundred horsemen, ""Up and at these hounds, for they even you in number!"" So saying, he bared his sabre and bore down on them, he and his, but the Franks met them with hearts firmer than rocks, and wight dashed against wight, and knight dashed upon knight, and hot waxed the fight, and sore was the affright, and nor parley nor cries of quarter helped their plight; and they stinted not to charge and to smite, right hand meeting right, nor to hack and hew with blades bright white, till day turned to night and gloom oppressed the sight. Then they drew apart and Sharrkan mustered his men and found none wounded save four only, who showed hurts but not death hurts. Said he to them, ""By Allah, my life long have I waded in the clashing sea of fight and I have met many a gallant sprite, but none so unfrightened of the sword that smites and the shock of men that affrights like these valiant Knights!"" ""Know, O King,"" said they, that there is among them a Frankish cavalier who is their leader and, indeed, he is a man of valour and fatal is his spear thrust: but, by Allah, he spares us great and small; for whoso falls into his hands he lets him go and forbears to slay him. By Allah, had he willed he had killed us all."" Sharrkan was astounded when he heard what the Knight had done and such high report of him, so he said, ""When the morn shall morrow, we will draw out and defy them, for we are an hundred to their hundred; and we will seek aid against them from the Lord of the Heavens."" So they rested that night in such intent; whilst the Franks gathered round their Captain and said, ""Verily this day we did not win our will of these;"" and he replied, ""At early dawn when the morrow shall morn, we will draw out and challenge them, one after one."" They also rested in that mind, and both camps kept guard until Almighty Allah sent the light of day dawn. Thereupon King Sharrkan and his hundred riders took horse and rode forth to the plain, where they found the Franks ranged in line of battle; and Sharrkan said to his followers, ""Our foes have determined like ourselves to do their devoir; so up and at them and lay on load."" Then came forth an Herald of the Franks and cried out, saying, ""Let there be no general engagement betwixt us this day, save by the duello, a champion of yours against a champion of ours."" Whereupon one of Sharrkan's riders dashed out from the ranks and crave between the two lines crying, ""Ho! who is for smiting? Let no dastard engage me this day nor niderling!"" Hardly had he made an end of his vaunt, when there sallied forth to him a Frankish cavalier, armed cap-à-pie and clad in a surcoat of gold stuff, riding on a grey white steed, and he had no hair on his cheeks. He urged his charger on to the midst of the battle plain and the two fell to derring do of cut and thrust, but it was not long before the Frank foined the Moslem with the lance point; and, toppling him from his steed, took him prisoner and led him off crestfallen. His folk rejoiced in their comrade and, forbidding him to go out again to the field, sent forth another, to whom sallied out another Moslem, brother to the captive, and offered him battle. The two fell to, either against other, and fought for a little while, till the Frank bore down upon the Moslem and, falsing him with a feint, tumbled him by a thrust of the lance heel from his destrier and took him prisoner. After this fashion the Moslems ceased not dashing forwards, one after one, and the Franks to unhorse them and take them captive, till day departed and the night with darkness upstarted. Now they had captured of the Moslems twenty cavaliers, and when Sharrken saw this, it was grievous to him and he mustered his men and said to them, ""What is this thing that hath befallen us? To- morrow, I myself will go forth to the field and offer singular combat to their chief and learn what is the cause of his entering our land and warn him against doing battle with our band. If he persist, we will punish him with death, and if he prove peaceable we will make peace with him."" They righted on this wise till Allah Almighty caused the morn to dawn, when mounted the twain and drew up for battle fain; and Sharrkan was going forth to the plain, but behold, more than one half of the Franks dismounted and remained on foot before one of them who was mounted, till they reached the midst of the battle plain. Sharrken looked at that horseman and lo! he was their chief. He was clad in a surcoat of blue satin and a close ringed mail shirt; his face was as the moon when it rises and no hair was upon his cheeks. He hent in hand an Indian scymitar and he rode a sable steed with a white blaze on brow, like a dirham; and he smote the horse with heel till he stood almost in the midst of the field when, signing to the Moslems, he cried out in fluent Arab speech ""Ho, Sharrkan! Ho, son of Omar bin al- Nu'uman! Ho, thou who forcest fortalice and overthrowest cities and countries! up and out to battle bout, and blade single handed wield with one who halves with thee the field! Thou art Prince of thy people and I am Prince of mine; and whoso overcometh his adversary, him let the other's men obey and come under his sway."" Hardly had he ended his speech, when out came Sharrkan with a heart full of fury, and urging his steed into the midst of the field, closed like a raging lion with the Frank who encountered him with wariness and steadfastness and met him with the meeting of warriors. Then they fell to foining and hewing, and they stinted not of onset and offset, and give and take, as they were two mountains clashing together or two seas together dashing; nor did they cease fighting until day darkened and night starkened. Then they drew apart and each returned to his own party; but as soon as Sharrkan foregathered with his comrades, he said, ""Never looked I on the like of this cavalier: he hath one quality I have not yet seen in any and this it is that, when his foemen uncovereth a place for the death blow, he reverseth his weapon and smiteth with the lance-heel! In very deed I know not what will be the issue 'twixt him and me; but 'tis my wish that we had in our host his like and the like of his men."" Then he went to his rest for the night and, when morning dawned, the Frank came forth and rode down to the mid field, where Sharrkan met him; and they fell to fighting and to wheeling, left and right; and necks were stretched out to see the sight, nor did they stint from strife and sword play and lunge of lance with main and might, till the day turned to night and darkness overwhelmed the light. Then the twain drew asunder and returned each to his own camp, where both related to their comrades what had befallen them in the duello; and at last the Frank said to his men, ""Tomorrow shall decide the matter!"" So they both passed that night restfully till dawn; and, as soon as it was day, they mounted and each bore down on other and ceased not to fight till half the day was done. Then the Frank bethought him of a ruse; first urging his steed with heel and then checking him with the rein, so that he stumbled and fell with his rider; thereupon Sharrkan threw himself on the foe, and would have smitten him with the sword fearing lest the strife be prolonged, when the Frank cried out to him, ""O Sharrkan, champions are not wont to do thus! This is the act of a man accustomed to be beaten by a woman."" When Sharrkan heard this, he raised his eyes to the Frank's face and gazing steadfastly at him, recognized in him Princess Abrizah with whom that pleasant adventure had befallen him in the convent; whereupon he cast brand from hand and, kissing the earth before her, asked her, ""What moved thee to a deed like this?""; and she answered, ""I desired to prove thy prowess afield and test thy doughtiness in tilting and jousting. These that are with me are my handmaids, and they are all clean maids; yet they have vanquished thy horsemen in fair press and stress of plain; and had not my steed stumbled with me, thou shouldst have seen my might and prowess in combat."" Sharrkan smiled at her speech and said, ""Praise be to Allah for safety and for my reunion with thee, O Queen of the age!"" Then she cried out to her damsels to loose the twenty captives of Sharrkan's troop and dismount. They did as she bade and came and kissed the earth before her and Sharrkan who said to them, ""It is the like of you that Kings keep in store for the need hour."" Then he signed to his comrades to salute the Princess; so all alighted and kissed the earth before her, for they knew the story. After this, the whole two hundred took horse, and fared on night and day for six days' space, till they drew near to Baghdad, when they halted and Sharrkan bade Abrizah and her handmaids doff the Frankish garb that was on them,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Fifty-first Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan bade Princess Abrizah and her damsels doff the garb that was on them and don the garments of daughters of Greece; and thus did they. Then he despatched a company of his companions to Baghdad to acquaint his father Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with his arrival and report that he was accompanied by Princess Abrizah, daughter of King Hardub, Lord of Graecia-land. They halted forthright in the place they had reached, and Sharrkan also halted and all righted there; and when Almighty Allah made morning dawn, Sharrkan and his company and Abrizah and her company took horse and fared on towards the city; when lo! on the way they met the Wazir Dandan, who had come out amongst a thousand horse to honour Abrizah and Sharrkan, by especial commandment of King Omar Son of Al- Nu'uman. When the two drew near, they turned towards them and kissed ground before them; then they mounted again and escorted them into the city and went up with them to the palace. Sharrkan walked in to his father, who rose and embraced him and questioned him of his case. So he told him all that Abrizah had told him, and what had passed between them and said, ""She hath parted from her sire and departed from her reign and hath chosen to take part with us and make her abode with us; and indeed,"" he said to his father, ""the King of Constantinople hath plotted to do us a mischief, because of his daughter Sophia, for that the King of Greece had made known to him her story and the cause of her being given to thee; and he (the Grecian King) not knowing her to be daughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople; and, had he known that, he would not have bestowed her upon thee, but he would have restored her to her parent. And of a verity,"" he continued, ""we were saved from these perils only by the Lady Abrizah, and never saw we a more valiant than she."" And he went on to tell his father all that had passed from first to last of the wrestling and the single fighting. When King Omar heard the story of Sharrkan, Abrizah was exalted in his eyes, and he longed to see her and question her. Thereupon Sharrkan went out to her and said, ""The King calleth for thee;"" she replied, ""I hear and I obey;"" and he took her and brought her in to his father, who was seated on his throne and who, having dismissed his high officers, was attended only by his eunuchs. The Princess entered and kissing the ground between his hands, saluted him in choice terms. He was amazed at her eloquent speech and thanked her for her dealing with his son Sharrkan and bade her be seated. So she sat down and unveiled her face; and, when the King saw her beauty, his reason fled his head and he made her draw near and showed her favour, appointing her an especial palace for herself and her damsels, and assigning them solde and allowances. Then began he to ask her of the three jewels aforesaid, and she answered, ""Here be they with me, O King of the age!"" So saying, she rose and going to her lodging, unpacked her baggage and from it brought out a box and from the box a casket of gold. She opened the casket and taking out those three jewels, kissed them and gave them to the King. Then she went away bearing his heart with her. After her going the King sent for his son Sharrkan and gave him one jewel of the three, and when he enquired of the other two replied, ""O my son! I mean to give one to thy brother Zau al-Makan, and the other to thy sister Nuzhat al- Zaman."" But when Sharrkan heard that he had a brother (for to that time he knew only of his sister) he turned to his sire and said to him, ""O King, hast thou a son other than myself?"" He answered, ""Yes, and he is now six years old;"" adding that his name was Zau al- Makan and that he and Nuzhat al-Zaman were twins, born at a birth. This news was grievous to Sharrkan, but he kept his secret and said, ""The bless- ing of Allah Most High be upon them!"", and he cast the jewel from his hand and shook the dust off his clothes. Quoth the King, ""How do I see thee change thy manner when hearing of this, considering that after me thou becomes"" heir of the kingdom. Of a truth the troops have sworn to thee and the Emirs and Grandees have taken the oath of succession to thee; and this one of the three jewels is thine."" Sharrkan bowed his head to the ground and was ashamed to bandy words with his parent so he accepted the jewel and went away, knowing not what to do for exceeding wrath, and stayed not walking till he had entered Abrizah's palace. As he approached she stood up to meet him and thanked him for what he had done and prayed for blessings on him and his sire. Then she sat down and seated him by her side; but when he had taken his place she saw rage in his face and questioned him, whereupon he told her that Allah had blessed his father with two children by Sophia, a boy and a girl, and that he had named the boy Zau al-Makan and the girl Nuzhat al-Zaman; adding, ""He hath kept the other two jewels for them and hath given me one of thine, so I left it behind; I knew naught of Zau al-Makan's birth till this day, and the twain are now six years old. So when I learnt this, wrath possessed me; and I tell thee the reason of my rage and hide nothing from thee. But now I fear lest my father take thee to wife, for he loveth thee and I saw in him signs of desire for thee: so what wilt thou say, if he wish this?"" Quoth she, ""Know, O Sharrkan, that thy father hath no dominion over me, nor can he have me without my consent; and if he prevail over me by force, I will take my own life. As for the three jewels, it was not my intent that he should give any of them to either of his children and I had no thought but that he would lay them up in his treasury with his things of price; but now I desire of thy favour that thou make me a present of the jewel which he gave thee, if thou have accepted it."" ""Hearkening and obedience,"" replied Sharrkan, and gave it to her. Then said she, ""Fear nothing,"" and talked with him awhile and continued, ""I fear lest my father hear that I am with you and sit not patiently under my loss, but do his endeavours to find me; and to that end he may ally himself with King Afridun, on account of his daughter Sophia, and both come on thee with armies and so there befal great turmoil."" When Sharrken heard these words, he said to her, ""O my lady, if it please thee to sojourn with us, take no thought of them; though there gather together against us all that be on land and on sea."" "" 'Tis well,"" rejoined she; ""if ye entreat me fair, I will tarry with you, and if ye deal evilly by me, I will depart from you."" Then she bade her slave maidens bring food; so they set the tables, and Sharrkan ate a little and went away to his own house, disturbed and perturbed. Such was his case; but regarding the affairs of his father, Omar bin al-Nu'uman, after dismissing his son Sharrkan he arose and, taking the other two jewels, betook himself to the Lady Sophia, who stood up when she saw him and remained standing till he was seated. Presently, his two children, Zau al-Makan and Nuzhat al-Zaman, came to him and he kissed them and hung a jewel round each one's neck, at which they rejoiced and kissed his hands. Then went they to their mother, who joyed in their joy and wished the King long life; so he asked her, ""Why hast thou not informed me all this time that thou art the daughter of King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, that I might have honoured thee still more and enlarged thee in dignity and raised thy rank?"" ""O King,"" answered Sophia, ""and what could I desire greater or higher than this my standing with thee, overwhelmed as I am with thy favours and thy benefits? And, furthermore, Allah hath blessed me with two children by thee, a son and a daughter."" Her reply pleased the King and after leaving her, he set apart for her and her children a wondrous fine palace. Moreover, he appointed for them eunuchs and attendants and doctors of law and doctors of philosophy and astrologers and physicians and surgeons to do them service; and in every way he redoubled his favour and entreated them with the best of treatment. And presently he returned to the palace of his dominion and to his Court where he distributed justice among the lieges. So far concerning him and Sophia and her children; but in the matter of Abrizah the King was greatly occupied with love of her and burnt with desire of her night and day; and every night, he would go in to her and converse with her and pay his court to her, but she gave him no answer, only saying, ""O King of the age! I have no desire for men at this present."" When he saw her withdraw from him, his passion waxed hotter and his longing and pining increased until, when weary of this, he summoned his Wazir Dandan and, opening his very heart to him, told him of his love for Princess Abrizah, daughter of Hardub, and informed him how she refused to yield to his wishes and how desire for her was doing him to die, for that he could get no grace of her. The Wazir, hearing these words, said to the King, ""As soon as it is dark night, take thou a piece of Bhang the measure of a miskal, about an ounce, and go in to her and drink somewhat of wine with her. When the hour of ending the carousel shall draw near, fill her a last cup and dropping therein the Bhang, give it to her to drink, and she will not reach her sleeping chamber ere the drug take effect on her. Then do thou go in to her and take thy will of her; and such is my advice."" ""Thy rede is aright,"" quoth the King, and seeking his treasury, he took thence a piece of concentrated Bhang, if an elephant smelt it he would sleep from year to year. This he put in his bosom pocket and waited till some little of the night went by, when he betook himself to the palace of Princess Abrizah, who seeing him stood up to receive him; but he bade her sit down. So she sat down, and he sat by her, and he began to talk with her of wine and wassail, whereupon she furnished the carousing table and placed it before him. Then she set on the drinking vessels and lighted the candles and ordered to bring dried fruits and sweet meats and all that pertaineth to drinking. So they fell to tippling and the King ceased not to pledge her till drunkenness crept into her head; and seeing this he took out the bit of Bhang from his pocket and, holding it between his fingers, filled a cup with his own hand and drank it off. Then filling a second he said, ""To thy companionship!""; and dropped the drug into her cup, she knowing naught of it. She took it and drank it off; then she rose and went to her sleeping chamber. He waited for less than an hour till he was assured that the dose had taken effect on her and had robbed her of her senses, when he went in to her and found her thrown on her back: and she had doffed her petticoat trousers and the air raised the skirt of her shift and discovered what was between her thighs. When the King saw the state of things and found a lighted candle at her head and another at her feet, shining upon what her thighs enshrined he took leave of his five senses for lust and Satan seduced him and he could not master himself, but put off his trousers and fell upon her and abated her maiden head. Then he rose off her and went to one of her women, by name Marjánah, and said, ""Go in to thy lady and speak with her."" So she went in to her mistress and found her lying on her back insensible, with the blood running down to the calves of her legs, whereupon she took a kerchief and wiped away the blood and lay by her that night. As soon as Almighty Allah brought the dawn, the handmaid Marjanah washed her mistress's hands and feet and brought rose water and bathed her face and mouth with it, where upon she sneezed and yawned and cast up from her inside that bit of Bhang like a bolus. Then she revived and washed her hands and mouth and said to Marjanah, ""Tell me what hath befallen me."" So she told her what had passed and how she had found her, lying on her back, with the blood running down, wherefore she knew that King Omar bin al-Nu'uman had lain with her and had undone her and taken his will of her. At this she grieved with exceeding grief and retired into privacy, saying to her damsels, ""Deny me to whoso would come in to me and say to him that I am ill, till I see what Allah will do with me."" Presently the news of her sickness came to the King; so he sent her sherbets and sugar electuaries. Some months she thus passed in solitude, during which time the King's flame cooled and his desire for her was quenched, so that he abstained from her. Now she had conceived by him, and when the months of child breeding had gone by, her pregnancy appeared and her belly swelled, and the world was straitened upon her, so she said to her handmaid Marjanah, ""Know that it is not the folk who have wronged me, but I who sinned against my own self in that I left my father and mother and country. Indeed, I abhor life, for my spirit is broken and neither courage nor strength is left me. I used, when I mounted my steed, to have the mastery of him, but now I am unable to ride. If I be brought to bed among them I shall be dishonoured before my hand women and every one in the palace will know that he hath taken my maidenhead in the way of shame; and if I return to my father, with what face shall I meet him or with what face shall I have recourse to him? How well quoth the poet,
'Say, what shall solace one who hath nor home nor stable stead *
             Nor cup companion, nor a cup, nor place to house his head?'""
Marjanah answered her, ""It is thine to command; I will obey;"" and Abrizah said, ""I desire at once to leave this place secretly, so that none shall know of me but thou; and return to my father and my mother, for when flesh stinketh, there is naught for it but its own folk and Allah shall do with me e'en as He will."" ""O Princess,"" Marjanah replied, ""what thou wouldest do is well."" Then she made matters ready and kept her secret and waited for some days till the King went out to chase and hunt, and his son Sharrkan betook himself to certain of the fortresses to sojourn there awhile. Then said she to Marjanah, ""I wish to set out this night, but how shall I do against my destiny? For already I feel the pangs of labour and child birth, and if I abide other four or five days, I shall be brought to bed here, and I shall be unable to travel to my country. But this is what was written on my forehead."" Then she considered awhile, and said to Marjanah, ""Look us out a man who will go with us and serve us by the way, for I have no strength to bear arms."" ""By Allah, O my lady,"" replied Marjanah, ""I know none but a black slave called Al- Ghazbán, who is one of the slaves of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman; he is a valiant wight, and he keepeth guard at our palace gate. The King appointed him to attend us, and indeed we have overwhelmed him with our favours; so, lookye, I will go out and speak with him of this matter, and promise him some monies and tell him that, if he have a mind to tarry with us, I will marry him to whom he will. He told me before to day that he had been a highwayman; so if he consent to us we shall win our wish and reach to our own land."" She rejoined, ""Call him that I may talk with him;"" whereupon Marjanah fared forth and said to the slave, 'O Ghazban, Allah prosper thee, so thou fall in with what my lady saith to thee!"" Then she took him by the hand and brought him to the Princess, whose hands he kissed but as she beheld him, her heart took fright at him. ""How ever,"" she said to herself, ""of a truth, Need giveth the law;"" and she approached to speak with him, yet her heart started away from him. Presently she said, ""O Ghazban, say me, wilt thou help me against the perfidies of Fortune and conceal my secret if I discover it to thee?"" When the slave saw her, his heart was taken by storm and he fell in love with her forthright and could not but reply; ""O my mistress, whatsoever thou biddest me do, I will not depart therefrom."" Quoth she, ""I would have thee take me at this hour and take this my handmaid and saddle us two camels and two of the King's horses and set on each horse a saddle bag of goods and somewhat of provaunt, and go with us to our own country; where, if thou desire to abide with us, I will marry thee to her thou shalt choose of my handmaidens, or, if thou prefer return to thine own land, we will marry thee and give thee whatso thou desires"" after thou hast taken of money what shall satisfy thee."" When Al Ghazban, heard this, he rejoiced with great joy and replied, ""O my lady, I will serve both of you with mine eyes and will go at once and saddle the horses."" Then he went away gladsome and saying to himself, ""I shall get my will of them and if they will not yield to me, I will kill them both and take their riches."" But he kept this his intent to himself, and presently returned with two camels and three head of horses, one of which he rode, and Princess Abrizah made Marjanah mount the second she mounting the third, albeit she was in labour pains and possessed not her soul for anguish. And the slave ceased not travelling with them night and day through the passes of the mountains, till there remained but musingly march between them and their own country; when the travail pangs came upon Abrizah and she could no longer resist; so she said to Al-Ghazban, ""Set me down, for the pains of labour are upon me;"" and cried to Marjanah, ""Do thou alight and sit by me and deliver me."" Then Marjanah dismounted from her horse, and Al-Ghazban did in like sort, and they made fast the bridles and helped the Princess to dismount, for she was aswoon from excess of anguish. When Al-Ghazban saw her on the ground, Satan entered into him and he drew his falchion and brandishing it in her face, said ""O my lady, vouchsafe me thy favours."" Hearing these words she turned to him and said, ""It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refused Kings and Braves!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Fifty-second Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Princess Abrizah said to the black slave Al Ghazban, ""It remaineth for me only that I yield me to negro slaves, after having refused Kings and Braves!"" And she was wroth with him and cried, ""Woe to thee! what words are these thou sayest? Out on thee, and talk not thus in my presence and know that I will never consent to what thou sayest, though I drink the cup of death. Wait till I have cast my burden and am delivered of the after birth, and then, if thou be able thereto, do with me as thou wilt; but, an thou leave not lewd talk at this time assuredly I will slay myself with my own hand and quit the world and be at peace from all this."" And she began reciting extempore,
""O spare me, thou Ghazban, indeed enow for me * Are heavy strokes
            of time, mischance and misery!
Whoredom my Lord forfends to all humanity; * Quoth He, 'Who
           breaks my bidding Hell for home shall see!'
And if thou leave not suing me to whoredom's way * Against th'
          Almighty's choicest gift, my chastity,
Upon my tribesmen I with might and main will call * And gather
          all, however far or near they be;
And with Yamáni blade were I in pieces hewn, * Ne'er shall he
           sight my face who makes for villeiny,
The face of free born come of noble folk and brave; * What then
            can be to me the seed of whoreson slave?""
When Ghazban heard these lines he was wroth exceedingly; his eyes reddened with blood and his face became a dusty grey; his nostrils swelled, his lips protruded and the repulsiveness of his aspect redoubled. And he repeated these couplets,
""Ho thou, Abrizah, mercy! leave me not for I * Of thy love and
             Yamáni glance the victim lie
My heart is cut to pieces by thy cruelty, * My body wasted and my
                   patience done to die:
From glances ravishing all hearts with witchery * Reason far
           flies, the while desire to thee draws nigh;
Though at thy call should armies fill the face of earth * E'en
           now I'd win my wish and worlds in arms defy!""
When Abrizah heard these words, she wept with sore weeping and said to him, ""Woe to thee, O Ghazban! How dareth the like of thee to address me such demand, O base born and obscene bred? Dost thou deem all folk are alike?"" When the vile slave heard this from her, he waxt more enraged and his eyes grew redder: and he came up to her and smiting her with the sword on her neck wounded her to the death. Then he drove her horse before him with the treasure and made off with himself to the mountains. Such was the case with Al-Ghazban; but as regards Abrizah, she gave birth to a son, like the moon, and Marjanah took the babe and did him the necessary offices and laid him by his mother's side; and lo and behold! the child fastened to its mother's breast and she dying. When Marjanah saw this, she cried out with a grievous cry and rent her raiment and cast dust on her head and buffeted her cheeks till blood flowed, saying, ""Alas, my mistress! Alas, the pity of it! Thou art dead by the hand of a worthless black slave, after all thy knightly prowess!"" And she ceased not weeping when suddenly a great cloud of dust arose and walled the horizon; but, after awhile, it lifted and discovered a numerous conquering host. Now this was the army of King Hardub, Princess Abrizah's father, and the cause of his coming was that when he heard of his daughter and her handmaids having fled to Baghdad, and that they were with King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, he had come forth, leading those with him, to seek tidings of her from travellers who might have seen her with the King. When he had gone a single day's march from his capital, he espied three horse men afar off and made towards them, intending to ask whence they came and seek news of his daughter. Now these three whom he saw at a distance were his daughter and Marjanah and the slave Al- Ghazban; and he made for them to push inquiry. Seeing this the villain blackamoor feared for himself; so he killed Abrizah and fled for his life. When they came up, King Hardub saw his daughter lying dead and Marjanah weeping over her, and he threw himself from his steed and fell fainting to the ground. All the riders of his company, the Emirs and Waxirs, took foot and forth right pitched their tents on the mountain and set up for the King a great pavilion, domed and circular, without which stood the grandees of the realm. When Marjanah saw her master, she at once recognized him and her tears redoubled; and, when he came to himself, he questioned her and she told him all that had passed and said, ""Of a truth he that hath slain thy daughter is a black slave belonging to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and she informed him how Sharrkan's father had dealt with the Princess. When King Hardub heard this, the world grew black in his sight and he wept with sore weeping. Then he called for a litter and, therein laying his dead daughter, returned to Caesarea and carried her into the palace, where he went in to his mother, Zat al-Dawahi, and said to that Lady of Calamities, ""Shall the Moslems deal thus with my girl? Verily King Omar bin al-Nu'uman despoiled her of her honour by force, and after this, one of his black slaves slew her. By the truth of the Messiah, I will assuredly take blood revenge for my daughter and clear away from mine honour the stain of shame; else will I kill myself with mine own hand!"" And he wept passing sore. Quoth his mother, ""None other than Marjanah killed thy daughter, for she hated her in secret;"" and she continued to her son, ""Fret not for taking the blood wit of thy daughter, for, by the truth of the Messiah, I will not turn back from King Omar bin al-Nu'uman till I have slain him and his sons; and of a very truth I will do with him a deed, passing the power of Sage and Knight, whereof the chroniclers shall tell chronicles in all countries and in every place: but needs must thou do my bidding in all I shall direct, for whoso be firmly set on the object of his desire shall surely compass his desire."" ""By the virtue of the Messiah,"" replied he, ""I will not cross thee in aught thou shalt say."" Then quoth she, ""Bring me a number of hand maids, high bosomed virgins, and summon the wise men of the age and let them teach them philosophy and the rules of behaviour before Kings, and the art of conversation and making verses; and let them talk with them of all manner science and edifying knowledge. And the sages must be Moslems, that they may teach them the language and traditions of the Arabs, together with the history of the Caliphs and the ancient annals of the Kings of Al-Islam; and if we persevere in this for four years' space, we shall gain our case. So possess thy soul in patience and wait; for one of the Arabs saith, 'If we take man bote after years forty the time were short to ye.' When we have taught the girls these things, we shall be able to work our will with our foe, for he doteth on women and he hath three hundred and sixty concubines, whereto are now added an hundred of the flowers of thy handmaidens who were with thy daughter, she that hath found mercy. As soon as I have made an end of their education, as described to thee, I will take them and set out with them in person."" When King Hardub heard his mother's words, he rejoiced and arose and kissed her head; and at once despatched messengers and couriers to lands sundry and manifold to fetch him Moslem sages. They obeyed his commands and fared to far countries and thence brought him the sages and the doctors he sought. When these came into presence, he honoured them with notable honorurs and bestowed dresses on them and appointed to them stipends and allowances and promised them much money whenas they should have taught the damsels. Then he committed the handmaidens to their hands—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Fifty-third Night.
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the sages and the doctors stood in presence of King Hardub, he honoured them with notable honours and committed the hand maidens to their hands, enjoining that these be instructed in all manner of knowledge, philosophy and polite accomplishments; and they set themselves to do his bidding. Such was the case with King Hardub; but as for King Omar bin al Nu'uman, when he returned from coursing and hunting and entered his palace, he sought Princess Abrizah but found her not, nor any one knew of her nor could any give him news of her. This was grievous to him and he said, ""How could the lady leave the palace unknown of any? Had my kingdom been at stake in this case, it were in perilous condition there being none to govern it! I will never again go to sport and hunt till I have stationed at the gates those who shall keep good guard over them!"" And he was sore vexed and his breast was straitened for the loss of Princess Abrizah. Hereupon behold, his son Sharrkan returned from his journey; and the father told him what had happened, and informed him how the lady had fled, whilst he was chasing and hunting, whereat he grieved with exceeding grief. Then King Omar took to visiting his children every day and making much of them and brought them learned men and doctors to teach them, appointing for them stipends. When Sharrkan saw this, he raged with exceeding rage and envied thereupon his brother and sister till the signs of chagrin appeared in his face and he ceased not to languish by reason of this matter: so one day his father said to him, ""Why do I see thee grown weak in body and yellow of face?"" ""O my father,"" replied Sharrkan, ""every time I see thee fondle my brother and sister and make much of them, jealousy seizeth on me, and I fear lest it grow on me till I slay them and thou slay me in return. And this is the reason of my weakness of body and change of complexion. But now I crave of thy favour that thou give me one of thy castles outlying the rest, that I may abide there the remnant of my life, for as the sayer of bywords saith, 'Absence from my friend is better and fitter for me'; and, 'Whatso eye doth not perceive, that garreth not heart to grieve.'"" And he bowed his head towards the ground. When King Omar bin al-Nu'uman heard his words and knew the cause of his ailment and of his being broken down, he soothed his heart and said to him, ""O my son, I grant thee this and I have not in my reign a greater than the Castle of Damascus, and the government of it is thine from this time."" Thereupon he forthright summoned his secretaries of state and bade them write Sharrkan's patent of investiture to the viceroyalty of Damascus of Syria. And when they had written it, he equipped him and sent with him the Wazir Dandan, and invested him with the rule and government and gave him instructions as to policy and regulations; and took leave of him, and the grandees and officers of state did likewise, and he set out with his host. When he arrived at Damascus, the townspeople beat the drums and blew the trumpets and decorated the city and came out to meet him in great state; whilst all the notables and grandees paced in procession, and those who stood to the right of the throne walked on his right flank, and the others to the left. Thus far concerning Sharrkan; but as regards his father, Omar bin al- Nu'uman, soon after the departure of his son, the children's tutors and governors presented themselves before him and said to him, ""O our lord, thy children have now learnt knowledge and they are completely versed in the rules of manners and the etiquette of ceremony."" The King rejoiced thereat with exceeding joy and conferred bountiful largesse upon the learned men, seeing Zau al- Makan grown up and flourishing and skilled in horsemanship. The Prince had reached the age of fourteen and he occupied himself with piety and prayers, loving the poor, the Olema and the Koran students, so that all the people of Baghdad loved him, men and women. One day, the procession of the Mahmil of Irák passed round Baghdad before its departure for the pilgrimage to Meccah and visitation of the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and preserve!). When Zau al-Makan the Mahmil procession he was seized with longing desire to become a pilgrim, so he went in to his sire and said, ""I come to ask thy leave to make the pilgrimage."" But his father forbade him saying, ""Wait till next year and I will go and thou too."" When the Prince saw that the matter was postponed, he betook himself to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, whom he found standing at prayer. As soon as she had ended her devotions he said to her, ""I am dying with desire of pilgrimage to the Holy House of Allah at Meccah and to visit the tomb of the Prophet, upon whom be peace! I asked my father's leave, but he forbade me that, so I mean to take privily somewhat of money and set out on the pilgrimage without his knowledge."" ""Allah upon thee,"" exclaimed she, ""take me with thee and deprive me not of visitation to the tomb of the Prophet, whom Allah bless and keep!"" And he answered, ""As soon as it is dark night, do thou come forth from this place, without telling any."" Accordingly,When it was the middle of the night she arose and took somewhat of money and donned a man's habit; and she ceased not walking to the palace gate, where she found Zau al-Makan with camels ready for marching. So he mounted and mounted her; and the two fared on till they were in the midst of the Iraki pilgrim-party, and they ceased not marching and Allah wrote safety for them, till they entered Meccah the Holy and stood upon Arafát and performed the pilgrimage rites. Then they made a visitation to the tomb of the Prophet (whom Allah bless and assain!) and thought to return with the pilgrims to their native land. But Zau al-Makan said to his sister, ""O my sister, it is in my mind to visit the Holy House, Jerusalem, and Abraham the Friend of Allah (on whom be peace!)."" ""I also desire so to do,"" replied she. So they agreed upon this and he fared forth and took passage for himself and her and they made ready and set out in the ship with a company of Jerusalem palmers. That very night the sister fell sick of an aguish chill, and was grievously ill but presently recovered, after which the brother also sickened. She tended him during his malady and they ceased not wayfaring till they arrived at Jerusalem, but the fever increased on him and he grew weaker and weaker. They alighted at a Khan and there hired a lodging; but Zau al- Makan's sickness ceased not to increase on him, till he was wasted with leanness and became delirious. At this, his sister was greatly afflicted and exclaimed, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! This is the decree of Allah!"" They sojourned in that place awhile, his weakness ever increasing and she attending him and buying necessaries for him and for herself, till all the money she had was expended and she became so poor that she had not so much as a dirham left. Then she sent a servant of the Khan to the bazar with some of her clothes, and he sold them and she spent the price upon her brother; then sold she something more and she ceased not selling all she had, piece by piece, till nothing was left but an old rug. Whereupon she wept and exclaimed, ""Verily is Allah the Orderer of the past and the future!"" Presently her brother said to her, ""O my sister, I feel recovery drawing near and my heart longeth for a little roast meat."" ""By Allah! O my brother,"" replied she, ""I have no face to beg; but tomorrow I will enter some rich man's house and serve him and earn somewhat for our living."" Then she bethought herself awhile and said, ""Of a truth 'tis hard for me to leave thee and thou in this state, but I must despite myself!"" He rejoined, ""Allah forbid! Thou wilt be put to shame; but there is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah!"" And he wept and she wept too. Then she said, ""O my brother, we are strangers who have dwelt here a full year, but none hath yet knocked at our door. Shall we then die of hunger? I know no resource but that I go out and do service and earn somewhat to keep us alive, till thou recover from thy sickness, when we will travel back to our native land."" She sat weeping awhile and he wept too, propped upon his elbow. Then Nuzhat al-Zaman arose and, veiling her head with a bit of camlet, which had been of the cameleer's clothes and which the owner had forgotten and left with them; she kissed the head of her brother and embraced him and went forth from him, weeping and knowing not whither she should wend. And she stinted not going and her brother Zau al-Makan awaiting her return till the supper time; but she came not, and he watched for her till the morning morrowed but still she returned not; and this endured till two days went by. He was greatly troubled thereat and his heart fluttered for her, and hunger was sore upon him. At last he left the chamber and, calling the servant of the caravanserai, said, ""I wish thee to bear me to the bazar."" So he carried him to the market street and laid him down there; and the people of Jerusalem gathered round him and were moved to tears seeing his condition. He signed to them begging for somewhat to eat; so they brought him some money from certain of the merchants who were in the bazar, and bought food and fed him therewith; after which they carried him to a shop, where they spread him a mat of palm leaves and set an ewer of water at his head. When night fell, all the folk went away, sore concerned for him and, in the middle of the night, he called to mind his sister and his sickness redoubled on him, so that he abstained from eating and drinking and became insensible to the world around him. Then the bazar people arose and took for him from the merchants thirty seven dirhams, and hiring a camel, said to the driver, ""Carry this sick man to Damascus and leave him in the hospital; haply he may be cured and recover health."" ""On my head be it!"" replied the camel man; but he said to himself, ""How shall I take this sick man to Damascus, and he nigh upon death?"" So he carried him away to a place and hid with him till the night, when he threw him down on the ash heap near the fire hole of a Hammam and went his way. When morning dawned the Stoker of the bath came to his work and, finding Zau al-Makan cast on his back, exclaimed, ""Why did they not throw their dead body anywhere but here?"" So saying, he gave him a kick and he moved; whereupon quoth the Fireman, ""Some one of you who hath eaten a bit of Hashish and hath thrown himself down in whatso place it be!"" Then he looked at his face and saw his hairless cheeks and his grace and comeliness; so he took pity on him and knew that he was sick and a stranger in the land. And he cried, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! verily, I have sinned against this youth, for indeed the Prophet (whom Allah bless and keep!) enjoineth honour to the stranger, more especially when the stranger is sick."" Then he carried him home and went in with him to his wife and bade her tend him. So she spread him a sleeping rug and set a cushion under his head, then warmed water for him and washed therewith his hands and feet and face. Meanwhile, the Stoker went to the market and bought some rose water and sugar, and sprinkled Zau al-Makan's face with the water and gave him to drink of the sherbet. Then he fetched a clean shirt and put it on him. With this, Zau al-Makan sniffed the zephyr of health and recovery returned to him; and he sat up and leant against the pillow. Hereat the Fireman rejoiced and exclaimed, ""Praise be to Allah for the welfare of this youth! O Allah, I beseech Thee by Thy knowledge of hidden things, that Thou make the salvation of this youth to be at my hands!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Fifty-fourth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Fireman exclaimed, ""O Allah, I beseech Thee of Thy knowledge of hidden things, that Thou make this young man's life the work of my hands!"" And he ceased not to nurse him for three days, giving him to drink of sherbet of sugar and willow flower water and rose water; and doing him all manner of service and kindness, till health began to return to his body and Zau al-Makan opened his eyes. Presently came in the Fireman and, seeing him sitting up and showing signs of amendment, said to him, ""What is now thy state, O my son?"" ""Praise be to Allah,"" replied Zau al-Makan, ""I am well and like to recover, if such be the will of Allah Almighty at this time."" The Stoker praised the Lord of All for this and, wending fast to the market, bought ten chickens, which he carried to his wife and said, ""Kill two of these for him every day, one at dawn of day and the other at fall of day."" So she rose up and killed a fowl and brought it to him boiled, and fed him with the flesh and made him drink its broth. When he had done eating, she fetched hot water and he washed his hands and lay back upon the pillow, whereupon she covered him up with the coverlet, and he slept till the time of the mid afternoon prayer. Then she arose and killed another fowl and boiled it; after which she cut it up and, bringing it to Zau al-Makan, said, ""Eat, O my son!"" While he was eating; behold, her husband entered and seeing her feeding him, sat down at his head and said to him, ""How is it with thee now, O my son?"" ""Thanks be to Allah for recovery!"" he replied: ""may the Almighty requite thee thy kindness to me."" At this the Fireman rejoiced and going out, bought sherbet of violets and rose water and made him drink it. Now the Stoker used to work at the Hammam all day for a wage of five dirhams, whereof he spent every day, for Zau al-Makan, one dirham upon sugar and sherbet of rose water and willow flower water, and another dirham for fowls; and he ceased not to entreat him thus kindly during a whole month, till the traces of illness ceased from him and he was once more sound and whole. Thereupon the Fireman and his wife rejoiced and asked him, ""O my son, wilt thou go with me to the bath?""; whereto he answered, ""Yes!"" So the Stoker went to the bazar and fetched a donkey boy, and he mounted Zau al-Makan on the ass and supported him in the saddle till they came to the bath. Then he made him sit down and seated the donkey boy in the furnace-room and went forth to the market and bought Iote leaves and lupin-flour, with which he returned to the bath and said to Zau al-Makan, ""O my master, in Allah's name, walk in and I will wash thy body."" So they entered the inner room of the bath, and the Fireman took to rubbing Zau al-Makan's legs and began to wash his body with the leaves and meal, when there came to them a bathman, whom the bath keeper had sent to Zau al-Makan; and he, seeing the Stoker washing and rubbing him, said, ""This is doing injury to the keeper's rights."" Replied the Fireman, ""The master overwhelmeth us with his favours!"" Then the bathman proceeded to shave Zau al-Makan's head, after which he and the Stoker washed themselves and returned to the house, where he clad Zau al-Makan in a shirt of fine stuff and a robe of his own; and gave him a handsome turband and girdle and a light kerchief which he wound about his neck. Meanwhile the Fireman's wife had killed and cooked two chickens; so, as soon as Zau al-Makan entered and seated himself on the carpet, the husband arose and, dissolving sugar in willow flower water, made him drink of it. Then he brought the food tray and, cutting up the chickens, fed him with the flesh and gave him the broth to drink till he was satisfied; when he washed his hands and praised Allah for recovery, and said to the Fireman, ""Thou art he whom the Almighty vouchsafed to me and made the cause of my cure!"" ""Leave this talk,"" replied the other, ""and tell us the cause of thy coming to this city and whence thou art. Thy face showeth signs of gentle breeding."" ""Tell me first how thou camest to fall in with me,"" said Zau al-Makan; ""and after I will tell thee my story."" Rejoined the Fireman, ""As for that, I found thee lying on the rubbish heap by the door of the fire house, as I went to my work near the morning, and knew not who had thrown thee there. So I carried thee home with me; and this is all my tale."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""Glory to Him who quickeneth the bones, though they be rotten! Indeed, O my brother, thou hast not done good save to one worthy of it, and thou shalt presently gather its fruitage."" And he added, ""But where am I now?"" ""Thou art in the city of Jerusalem,"" replied the Stoker; where upon Zau al-Makan called to mind his strangerhood and remembered his separation from his sister and wept. Then he discovered his secret to the Fireman and told him his story and began repeating,
""In love they bore me further than my force would go, * And for
            them made me suffer resurrection throe:
Oh, have compassion, cruel! on this soul of mine * Which, since
            ye fared, is pitied by each envious foe;
Nor grudge the tender mercy of one passing glance * My case to
            lighten, easing this excess of woe:
Quoth I 'Heart, bear this loss in patience!' Patience cried *
             'Take heed! no patience in such plight I'm wont to show.' ""
Then he redoubled his weeping, and the Fireman said to him, ""Weep not, but rather praise Allah for safety and recovery."" Asked Zau al-Makan, ""How far is it hence to Damascus?"" Answered the other, ""Six days' journey."" Then quoth Zau al-Makan, ""Wilt thou send me thither?"" ""O my lord,"" quoth the Stoker, ""how can I allow thee to go alone, and thou a youth and a stranger to boot? If thou would journey to Damascus, I am one who will go with thee; and if my wife will listen to and obey me and accompany me, I will take up my abode there; for it is no light matter to part with thee."" Then said he to his wife, ""Wilt thou travel with me to Damascus of Syria or wilt thou abide here, whilst I lead this my lord thither and return to thee? For he is bent upon going to Damascus of Syria and, by Allah, it is hard to me to part with him, and I fear for him from highway men."" Replied she, ""I will go with you both;"" and he rejoined, ""Praised be Allah for accord, and we have said the last word!"" Then he rose and selling all his own goods and his wife's gear,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say,
When it was the Fifty-fifth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Fire man and his wife agreed with Zau al-Makan to travel with him Damascus wards. Then the Stoker sold his goods and his wife's gear and bought a camel and hired an ass for Zau al-Makan; and they set out, and ceased not wayfaring for six days till they reached Damascus. And they arrived there towards eventide; when the Fireman went forth and, as was his wont, bought some meat and drink. They had dwelt but five days in Damascus, when his wife sickened and, after a short illness, was translated to the mercy of Almighty Allah. Her death was a heavy matter to Zau al-Makan, for he was grown used to her as she had tended him assiduously; and the Fireman grieved for her with excessive grief. Presently the Prince turned to the Stoker and finding him mourning, said to him, ""Grieve not, for at this gate we must all go in."" Replied he, ""Allah make weal thy lot, O my son! Surely He will compensate us with His favours and cause our mourning to cease. What sayst thou, O my son, about our walking abroad to view Damascus and cheer thy spirits?"" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""Thy will is mine."" So the Fireman arose and placed his hand in that of Zau al- Makan and the two walked on till they came to the stables of the Viceroy of Damascus, where they found camels laden with chests and carpets and brocaded stuffs, and horses ready saddled and Bactrian dromedaries, while Mamelukes and negro slaves and folk in a hubbub were running to and fro. Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""I wonder to whom belong all these chattels and camels and stuffs!"" So he asked one of the eunuchs, ""Whither this dispatching?'' and he answered, ""These are presents sent by the Emir of Damascus to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, with the tribute of Syria."" Now when Zau al-Makan heard his father's name his eyes brimmed over with tears, and he began repeating,
""Oh ye gone from the gaze of these ridded eyne, * Ye whose sight
             in my spirit shall ever dwell!
Your charms are gone, but this heart of me * Hath no sweet, and
             no pleasures its sour dispel;
If Allah's grace make us meet again, * In long drawn love-tale my
             love I'll tell.""
And when he had ended his verse, he wept and the Fireman said to him, ""O my son, we hardly believed that thy health had returned; so take heart and do not weep, for I fear a relapse for thee."" And he ceased not comforting and cheering him, whilst Zau al-Makan sighed and moaned over his strangerhood and separation from his sister and his family; and tears streamed from his eyes and he recited these couplets,
""Get thee provaunt in this world ere thou wend upon thy way, *
           And know how surely Death descends thy life lot to waylay:
All thy worldly goods are pride and the painfullest repine; * All
           thy worldly life is vexing, of thy soul in vain display:
Say is not worldly wone like a wanderer's place of rest, * Where
           at night he 'nakhs' his camels and moves off at dawn
           of day?""
And he continued to weep and wail over his separation; whilst the Fireman also bewept the loss of his wife, yet ceased not to comfort Zau al-Makan till morning dawned. When the sun rose, he said to him, ""Meseemeth thou yearnest for thy native land?"" ""Yes,"" replied Zau al-Makan, ""and I can no longer tarry here; so I will commend thee to Allah's care and set out with these folk and journey with them, little by little, till I come to my mother land."" Said the Stoker, ""And I with thee; for of a truth I cannot bear to part with thee. I have done thee kindly service and I mean to complete it by tending thee on thy travel."" At this, Zau al-Makan rejoiced and said, ""Allah abundantly requite thee for me!"" and was pleased with the idea of their travelling together. The Fireman at once went forth and bought another ass, selling the camel; and laid in his provaunt and said to Zau al-Makan, ""This is for thee to ride by the way; and, when thou art weary of riding, thou canst dismount and walk."" Said Zau al-Makan, ""May Allah bless thee and aid me to requite thee! for verily thou hast dealt with me more lovingly than one with his brother."" Then he waited till it was dark night, when he laid the provisions and baggage on that ass and set forth upon their journey. This much befel Zau al-Makan and the Fireman; but as regards what happened to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman, when she left her brother in the Khan where they abode and, wrapped in the old camlet, went out to seek service with some one, that she might earn wherewithal to buy him the roast meat he longed for, she fared on, weeping and knowing not whither to go, whilst her mind was occupied with thoughts of her brother and of her family and her native land. So she implored Allah Almighty to do away with these calamities from them and began versifying,
""Dark falls the night and Passion comes sore pains to gar me
            dree, * And pine upstirs those ceaseless pangs which work my
           tormentry,
And cease not separation flames my vitals to consume, * And
           drives me on destruction way this sorrow's ecstacy
And longing breeds me restlessness; desire for ever fires, * And
          tears to all proclaim what I would keep in secrecy
No cunning shift is known to me a meeting to secure, * That I may
            quit this sickly state, may cure my malady:
The love which blazeth in my heart is fed with fancy fuel, * The
           lover from its hell of fire must bear Hell's agony!
O thou who blamest me for all befel me, 'tis enough, * Patient I
           bear what ever wrote the Reed of Doom for me:
By Love I swear I'll never be consoled, no, never more; * I swear
             the oath of Love's own slaves who know no perjury:
O Night, to chroniclers of Love the news of me declare; * That
           sleep hath fed mine eyelids of thy knowledge witness bear!""
Then she walked on, weeping and turning right and left as she went, when behold, there espied her an old Badawi who had come into the town from the desert with wild Arabs other five. The old man took note of her and saw that she was lovely, but she had nothing on her head save a piece of camlet, and, marvelling at her beauty, he said to himself, ""This charmer dazzleth men's wits but she is in squalid condition, and whether she be of the people of this city or she be a stranger, I needs must have her."" So he followed her, little by little, till he met her face to face and stopped the way before her in a narrow lane, and called out to her, asking her case, and said, ""Tell me, O my little daughter! art thou a free woman or a slave?"" When she heard this, she said to him, ""By thy life, do not add to my sorrows!"" Quoth he, ""Allah hath blessed me with six daughters, of whom five died and only one is left me, the youngest of all; and I came to ask thee if thou be of the folk of this city or a stranger; that I might take thee and carry thee to her, to bear her company so as to divert her from pining for her sisters. If thou have no kith and kin, I will make thee as one of them and thou and she shall be as my two children."" Nuzhat al-Zaman bowed her head in bashfulness when she heard what he said and communed with herself, ""Haply I may trust myself to this old man."" Then she said to him, ""O nuncle, I am a maiden of the Arabs and a stranger and I have a sick brother; but I will go with thee to thy daughter on one condition, which is, that I may spend only the day with her and at night may return to my brother. If thou strike this bargain I will fare with thee, for I am a stranger and I was high in honour among my tribe, and I awoke one morning to find myself vile and abject. I came with my brother from the land of Al-Hijaz and I fearless he know not where I am."" When the Badawi heard this, he said to himself, ""By Allah, I have got my desire!"" Then he turned to her and replied, ""There shall none be dearer to me than thou; I wish thee only to bear my daughter company by day and thou shalt go to thy brother at earliest nightfall. Or, if thou wilt, bring him over to dwell with us."" And the Badawi ceased not to console her heart and coax her, till she trusted in him and agreed to serve him. Then he walked on before her and, when she followed him, he winked to his men to go in advance and harness the dromedaries and load them with their packs and place upon them water and provisions, ready for setting out as soon as he should come up with the camels. Now this Badawi was a base born churl, a highway thief and a traitor to the friend he held most fief, a rogue in grain, past master of plots and chicane. He had no daughter and no son and was only passing through the town when, by the decree of the Decreer, he fell in with this unhappy one. And he ceased not to hold her in converse on the highway till they came without the city of Jerusalem and, when outside, he joined his companions and found they had made ready the dromedaries. So the Badawi mounted a camel, having seated Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him and they rode on all night. Then she knew that the Badawi's proposal was a snare and that he had tricked her; and she continued weeping and crying out the whole night long, while they journeyed on making for the mountains, in fear any should see them. Now when it was near dawn, they dismounted from their dromedaries and the Badawi came up to Nuzhat al-Zaman and said to her, ""O city strumpet, what is this weeping? By Allah, an thou hold not thy peace, I will beat thee to death, O thou town filth!"" When she heard this she loathed life and longed for death; so she turned to him and said, ""O accursed old man, O gray beard of hell, how have I trusted thee and thou hast played me false, and now thou wouldst torture me?"" When he heard her reply he cried out, ""O lazy baggage, dost thou dare to bandy words with me?"" And he stood up to her and beat her with a whip, saying, ""An thou hold not thy peace, I will kill thee!"" So she was silent awhile, then she called to mind her brother and the happy estate she had been in and she shed tears secretly. Next day, she turned to the Badawi and said to him, ""How couldst thou play me this trick and lure me into these bald and stony mountains, and what is thy design with me?"" When he heard her words he hardened his heart and said to her, ""O lazy baggage of ill omen and insolent! wilt thou bandy words with me?"" and he took the whip and came down with it on her back till she felt faint. Then she bowed down over his feet and kissed them; and he left beating her and began reviling her and said, ""By the rights of my bonnet, if I see or hear thee weeping, I will cut out thy tongue and stuff it up thy coynte, O thou city filth!"" So she was silent and made him no reply, for the beating pained her; but sat down with her arms round her knees and, bowing her head upon her collar, began to look into her case and her abasement after her lot of high honour; and the beating she had endured; and she called to mind her brother and his sickness and forlorn condition, and how they were both strangers in a far country, which crave her tears down her cheeks and she wept silently and began repeating,
""Time hath for his wont to upraise and debase, * Nor is lasting
           condition for human race:
In this world each thing hath appointed turn; * Nor may man
            transgress his determined place:
How long these perils and woes? Ah woe * For a life, all woeful
            in parlous case!
Allah bless not the days which have laid me low * I' the world,
            with disgrace after so much grace!
My wish is baffled, my hopes cast down, * And distance forbids me
             to greet his face:
O thou who passeth that dear one's door, * Say for me, these
             tears shall flow evermore!""
When she had finished her verses, the Badawi came up to her and, taking compassion on her, bespoke her kindly and wiped away her tears. Then he gave her a barley scone and said, ""I love not one who answereth at times when I am in wrath: so henceforth give me no more of these impertinent words and I will sell thee to a good man like myself, who will do well with thee, even as I have done."" ""Yes; whatso thou doest is right,"" answered she; and when the night was longsome upon her and hunger burnt her, she ate very little of that barley bread. In the middle of the night the Badawi gave orders for departure,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Fifty-sixth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Badawi gave the barley scone to Nuzhat al-Zaman and promised he would sell her to a good man like himself, she replied, ""Whatso thou doest is right!"" and, about midnight when hunger burned her, she ate a very little of that barley bread and the Badawi ordered his party to set out; so they loaded their loads and he mounted a camel setting Nuzhat al-Zaman behind him. Then they journeyed and ceased not journeying for three days, till they entered the city of Damascus and alighted at the Sultan's Khan, hard by the Viceroy's Gate. Now she had lost her colour by grief and the fatigue of such travelling, and she ceased not to weep over her misfortunes. So the Badawi came up to her and said, ""O thou city filth, by the right of my bonnet, if thou leave not this weeping, I will sell thee to none but a Jew!"" Then he arose and took her by the hand and carried her to a chamber, and walked off to the bazar, and he went round to, the merchants who dealt in slave girls, and began to parley with them, saying, ""I have brought a slave girl whose brother fell ill, and I sent him to my people about Jerusalem, that they might tend him till he is cured. As for her I want to sell her, but after the dog her brother fell sick, the separation from him was grievous to her, and since then she doth nothing but weep, and now I wish that whoso is minded to buy her of me speak softly to her and say, 'Thy brother is with me in Jerusalem ill'; and I will be easy with him about her price."" Then one of the merchants came up to him and asked, ""How old is she?"" He answered ""She is a virgin, just come to marriageable age, and she is endowed with sense and breeding and wit and beauty and loveliness. But from the day I sent her brother to Jerusalem, her heart hath been yearning for him, so that her beauty is fallen away and her value lessened."" Now when the merchant heard this, he set forth with the Badawi and said, ""O Shaykh of the Arabs, I will go with thee and buy of thee this girl whom thou praisest so highly for wit and manners and beauty and loveliness; and I will pay thee her price but it must be upon conditions which if thou accept, I will give thee ready money, and if thou accept not I will return her to thee."" Quoth the Badawi, ""An thou wilt, take her up to the Sultan Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan, and condition me any conditions thou likest, for when thou hast brought her before King Sharrkan, haply she will please him, and he will pay thee her price and a good profit for thyself to boot."" Rejoined the merchant, ""It happens that I have just now something to ask from him, and it is this that he write me an order upon the office, exempting me from custom dues and also that he write me a letter of recommendation to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman. So if he take the girl, I will weigh thee out her price at once."" ""I agree with thee to this condition,"" answered the Badawi. So they returned together to the place where Nuzhat al-Zaman was and the wild Arab stood at the chamber door and called out, saying, ""O Nájiyah!"" which was the name wherewith he had named her. When she heard him, she wept and made no answer. Then he turned to the merchant and said to him, ""There she sitteth; go to her and look at her and speak to her kindly as I enjoined thee."" So the trader went up to her in courteous wise and saw that she was wondrous beautiful and loveable, especially as she knew the Arabic tongue; and he said to the Badawi, ""If she be even as thou saddest, I shall get of the Sultan what I will for her."" Then he bespake her, ""Peace be on thee, my little maid! How art thou?"" She turned to him and replied, ""This also was registered in the Book of Destiny."" Then she looked at him and, seeing him to be a man of respectable semblance with a handsome face, she said to herself, ""I believe this one cometh to buy me;"" and she continued, ""If I hold aloof from him, I shall abide with my tyrant and he will do me to death with beating. In any case, this person is handsome of face and maketh me hope for better treatment from him than from my brute of a Badawi. May be he cometh only to hear me talk; so I will give him a fair answer."" All this while her eyes were fixed on the ground; then she raised them to him and said in a sweet voice, ""And upon thee be peace, O my lord, and Allah's mercy and His benediction! This is what is commanded of the Prophet, whom Allah bless and preserve! As for thine enquiry how I am, if thou wouldst know my case, it is such as thou wouldst not wish but to thy foe."" And she held her peace. When the merchant heard what she said, his fancy took wings for delight in her and, turning to the Badawi, he asked him, ""What is her price, for indeed she is noble?"" Thereupon the Badawi waxed angry and answered, ""Thou wilt turn me the girl's head with this talk! Why dost thou say that she is noble, while she is of the scum of slave girls and of the refuse of folk? I will not sell her to thee!"" When the merchant heard this, he knew the man to be weak of wits and said to him, ""Calm thyself, for I will buy her of thee with these blemishes thou mentionest."" ""And how much wilt thou give me for her?"" enquired the Badawi. Replied the merchant, ""Name thy price for her: none should name the son save his sire."" Rejoined the Badawi, ""None shall name it but thou thyself."" Quoth the merchant to himself, ""This wildling is a rudesby and a maggotty head. By Allah, I cannot tell her price, for she hath won my heart with her fair speech and good looks; and, if she can read and write, it will be complete fair luck to her and to her purchaser. But this Badawi does not know her worth."" Then he turned and said to him, ""O Shaykh of the Arabs, I will give thee in ready money, clear of the tax and the Sultan's dues, two hundred gold pieces."" Now when the Badawi heard this, he flew into a violent rage and cried at the merchant, saying, ""Get up and go thy ways! By Allah, wert thou to offer me two hundred diners for the bit of camlet she weareth, I would not sell it to thee. And now I will not sell her, but will keep her by me, to pasture the camels and grind my grist."" And he cried out to her, saying, ""Come here, thou stinkard! I will not sell thee."" Then he turned to the merchant and said to him, ""I used to think thee a man of judgment; but, by the right of my bonnet, if thou begone not from me, I will let thee hear what shall not please thee!"" Quoth the merchant to himself, ""Of a truth this Badawi is mad and knoweth not her value, and I will say no more to him about her price at the present time; for by Allah, were he a man of sense, he would not say, 'By the rights of my bonnet!' By the Almighty, she is worth the kingdom of the Chosroës and I have not her price by me, but if he ask even more, I will give him what he will, though it be all my goods."" Then he turned and said to him, ""O Shaykh of the Arabs, take patience and calm thyself and tell me what clothes she hath with thee?"" Cried the Badawi, ""And what hath the baggage to do with clothes? By Allah, this camlet in which she is wrapped is ample for her."" ""With thy leave,"" said the merchant, ""I will unveil her face and examine her even as folk examine slave girls whom they think of buying."" Replied the other, ""Up and do what thou wilt and Allah keep thy youth! Examine her outside and inside and, if thou wilt, strip off her clothes and look at her when she is naked."" Quoth the trader, ""Allah forfend! I will look at naught save her face."" Then he went up to her and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness,—And Shahrazed perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Fifty-seventh Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the merchant went up to Nuzhat al-Zaman and was put to shame by her beauty and loveliness, so he sat by her side and asked her, ""O my mistress, what is thy name?"" She answered, ""Doss thou ask what is my name this day or what it was before this day?"" Thereupon the merchant enquired, ""Hast thou then two names: to day's and yesterday's?"" ""Yes,"" replied she, ""my name in the past was Nuzhat al-Zaman, the Delight of the Age; but my name at this present is Ghussat al-Zaman, the Despight of the Age."" When the merchant heard this his eyes brimmed over with tears and quoth he to her, ""Hast thou not a sick brother?"" ""Ay by Allah, O my lord, I have,"" quoth she, ""but fortune hath parted me and him and he lieth sick in Jerusalem."" The merchant's head was confounded at the sweetness of her speech and he said to himself, ""Verily, the Badawi spake the truth of her."" Then she called to mind her brother and his sickness and his strangerhood and her separation from him in his hour of weakness and her not knowing what had befallen him; and she thought of all that had happened to her with the Badawi and of her severance from her mother and father and native land; and the tears coursed down her cheeks and fast as they started they dropped; and she began reciting,
""Allah, where'er thou be, His aid impart * To thee, who distant
             dwellest in my heart!
Allah be near thee how so far thou fare; * Ward off all shifts of
            Time, all dangers thwart!
Mine eyes are desolate for thy vanisht sight, * And start my
            tears-ah me, how fast they start!
Would Heaven I kenned what quarter or what land * Homes thee, and
           in what house and tribe thou art
A fount of life thou drain in greenth of rose, * While drink I
             tear drops for my sole desert?
An thou 'joy slumber in those hours, when I * Peel 'twixt my side
           and couch coals' burning smart?
All things were easy save to part from thee, * For my sad heart
           this grief is hard to dree.""
When the merchant heard her verses, he wept and put out his hand to wipe away the tears from her cheeks; but she let down her veil over her face, saying, ""Heaven forbid, O my lord!'' Then the Badawi, who was sitting at a little distance watching them, saw her cover her face from the merchant while about to wipe the tears from her cheeks; and he concluded that she would have hindered him from handling her: so he rose and running to her, dealt her, with a camel's halter he had in his hand, such a blow on the shoulders that she fell to the ground on her face. Her eyebrow struck a stone which cut it open, and the blood streamed down her cheeks; whereupon she screamed a loud scream and felt faint and wept bitterly. The merchant was moved to tears for her and said in himself, ""There is no help for it but that I buy this damsel, though at her weight in gold, and free her from this tyrant."" And he began to revile the Badawi whilst Nazhat al- Zaman lay in sensible. When she came to herself, she wiped away the tears and blood from her face; and she bound up her head: then, raising her glance to heaven, she besought her Lord with a sorrowful heart and began repeating,
""And pity one who erst in honour throve, * And now is fallen into
             sore disgrace.
She weeps and bathes her cheeks with railing tears, * And asks
            'What cure can meet this fatal case?'""
When she had ended her verse, she turned to the merchant and said in an undertone, ""By the Almighty, do not leave me with a tyrant who knoweth not Allah the Most High! If I pass this night in his place, I shall kill myself with my own hand: save me from him, so Allah save thee from Gehenna-fire."" Then quoth the merchant to the Badawi, ""O Shaykh of the Arabs, this slave is none of thine affair; so do thou sell her to me for what thou wilt."" ""Take her,"" quoth the Badawi, ""and pay me down her price, or I will carry her back to the camp and there set her to feed the camels and gather their dung."" Said the merchant, ""I will give thee fifty thousand diners for her."" ""Allah will open!"" replied the Badawi. ""Seventy thousand,"" said the merchant. ""Allah will open!"" repeated the Badawi: ""this is not the capital spent upon her, for she hath eaten with me barley bread to the value of ninety thousand gold pieces."" The merchant rejoined, ""Thou and thine and all thy tribe in the length of your lives have not eaten a thousand ducats' worth of barley; but I will say thee one word, wherewith if thou be not satisfied, I will set the Viceroy of Damascus on thee and he will take her from thee by force."" The Badawi continued, ""Say on!"" ""An hundred thousand,"" quoth the merchant. ""I have sold her to thee at that price,"" answered the Badawi; ""I shall be able to buy salt with her."" The merchant laughed and, going to his lodgings, brought the money and put it into the hand of the Badawi, who took it and made off, saying to himself, ""Needs must I go to Jerusalem where, haply, I shall happen on her brother, and I will bring him here and sell him also."" So he mounted and journeyed till he arrived at Jerusalem, where he went to the Khan and asked for Zau al-Makan, but could not find him. Such was the case with him; but for what regards the merchant and Nazhat al-Zaman, when he took her he threw some of his clothes over her and carried her to his lodgings,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Fifty-eighth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the trader saved Nuzhat al-Zaman from the Badawi and bore her to his lodgings and robed her in the richest raiment, he went down with her to the bazar, where he bought her what ornaments she chose and put them in a satin bag, which he set before her, saying, ""All is for thee and I ask nothing of thee in return but that, when I lead thee to the Sultan, Viceroy of Damascus, thou acquaint him with the price I paid for thee, albeit it was little compared with thy value: and, if seeing thee he buy thee of me, thou tell him how I have dealt with thee and ask of him for me a royal patent, and a written recommendation wherewith I can repair to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad, to the intent that he may forbid the tax on my stuffs or any other goods in which I traffic."" When she heard his words, she wept and sobbed, and the merchant said to her, ""O my lady, I observe that, every time I mention Baghdad, thine eyes are tearful: is there any one there whom thou lovest? If it be a trader or the like, tell me; for I know all the merchants and so forth there and, if thou wouldst send him a message, I will bear it for thee."" Replied she, ""By Allah, I have no acquaintance among merchant folk and the like! I know none there but King Omar bin Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad."" When the merchant heard her words, he laughed and rejoiced with exceeding joy and said in himself, ""By Allah, I have won my wish!"" Then he said to her, ""Hast thou been shown to him in time past?"" She answered, ""No, but I was brought up with his daughter and he holdeth me dear and I have high honour with him; so if thou wouldst have the King grant thee thy desire, give me ink case and paper and I will write thee a letter; and when thou reachest the city of Baghdad, do thou deliver it into the hand of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and say to him, 'Thy handmaid, Nuzhat al-Zaman, would have thee to know that the chances and changes of the nights and days have struck her as with a hammer, and have smitten her so that she hath been sold from place to place, and she sendeth thee her salams.' And, if he ask further of her, say that I am now with the Viceroy at Damascus."" The merchant wondered at her eloquence, and his affection for her increased and he said to her I cannot but think that men have played upon thine understanding and sold thee for money. Tell me, dost thou know the Koran by heart?"" ""Yes,"" answered she; ""and I am also acquainted with philosophy and medicine and the prolegomena of science and the commentaries of Galen, the physician, on the canons of Hippocrates; and I have commented him and I have read the Tazkirah and have commented the Burhán; and I have studied the Simples of Ibn Baytár, and I have something to say of the canon of Meccah, by Avicenna. I can ree riddles and can solve ambiguities, and discourse upon geometry and am skilled in anatomy I have read the books of the Sháfi'í school and the Traditions of the Prophet and syntax; and I can argue with the Olema and discourse of all manner learning. Moreover I am skilled in logic and rhetoric and arithmetic and the making of talismans and almanacs, and I know thoroughly the Spiritual Sciences and the times appointed for religious duties and I understand all these branches of knowledge."" Then quoth she to the merchant, ""Bring me ink case and paper, that I write thee a letter which shall aid thee on thy journey to Baghdad and enable thee to do without passports."" Now when the merchant heard this, he cried out ""Brava! Brava! Then O happy he in whose palace thou shalt! Thereupon he brought her paper and ink case and a pen of brass and bussed the earth before her face to do her honour. She took a sheet and handled the reed and wrote therewith these verses,
""I see all power of sleep from eyes of me hath flown; * Say, did
           thy parting teach these eyne on wake to wone?
What makes thy memory light such burnings in my heart? * Hath
            every lover strength such memories to own?
How sweet the big dropped cloud which rained on summer day; *
            'Tis gone and ere I taste its sweets afar 'tis flown:
I pray the wind with windy breath to bring some news * From thee,
            to lover wightwi' love so woe begone
Complains to thee a lover of all hope forlorn, * For parting
             pangs can break not only heart but stone.""
And when she had ended writing the verses she continued, ""These words are from her who saith that melancholy destroyeth her and that watching wasteth her; in the murk of whose night is found no light and darkness and day are the same in her sight. She tosseth on the couch of separation and her eyes are blackened with the pencils of sleeplessness; she watcheth the stars arise and into the gloom she strains her eyes: verily, sadness and leanness have consumed her strength and the setting forth of her case would run to length. No helper hath she but tears and she reciteth these verses,
'No ring dove moans from home on branch in morning light, * But
             shakes my very frame with sorrow's killing might:
No lover sigheth for his love or gladdeth heart * To meet his
             mate, but breeds in me redoubled blight
I bear my plaint to one who has no ruth for me, * Ah me, how Love
             can part man's mortal frame and sprite!' ""
Then her eyes welled over with tears, and she wrote also these two couplets,
""Love smote my frame so sore on parting day, * That severance
             severed sleep and eyes for aye.
I waxt so lean that I am still a man, * But for my speaking, thou
             wouldst never say.""
Then she shed tears and wrote at the foot of the sheet, ""This cometh from her who is far from her folk and her native land, the sorrowful hearted woman Nuzhat al-Zaman."" In fine, she folded the sheet and gave it to the merchant, who took it and kissed it and understood its contents and exclaimed, ""Glory to Him who fashioned thee!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Fifty-ninth Night,
She said, It reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al-Zaman wrote the letter and gave it to the merchant; and he took it and read it and understood the contents and exclaimed, ""Glory to Him who fashioned thee!"" Then he redoubled his kindness and made himself pleasant to her all that day, and when night came he sallied out to the bazar and bought some food, wherewith he fed her; after which he carried her to the Hammam and said to the bath woman, ""As soon as thou hast made an end of washing her head, dress her and send and let me know of it."" And she replied ""Hearing is obeying."" Meanwhile he fetched food and fruit and wax candles and set them on the bench in the outer room of the bath; and when the tire woman had done washing her, she dressed her and led her out of the bath and seated her on the bench. Then she sent to tell the merchant, and Nuzhat al-Zaman went forth to the outer room, where she found the tray spread with food and fruit. So she ate and the tire woman with her, and gave the rest to the people and keeper of the bath. Then she slept till the morning, and the merchant lay the night in a place apart from her. When he aroused himself from sleep he came to her and waking her, presented her with a shift of fine stuff and a head kerchief worth a thousand diners, a suit of Turkish embroidery and walking boots purfled with red gold and set with pearls and gems. Moreover, he hung in each of her ears a circlet of gold with a fine pearl therein, worth a thousand diners, and threw round her neck a collar of gold with bosses of garnet and a chain of amber beads that hung down between her breasts over her navel. Now to this chain were attached ten balls and nine crescents, and each crescent had in its midst a bezel of ruby, and each ball a bezel of balass: the value of the chain was three thousand diners and each of the balls was priced at twenty thousand dirhams, so that the dress she wore was worth in all a great sum of money. When she had put these on, the merchant bade her adorn herself, and she adorned herself to the utmost beauty; then she let fall her fillet over her eyes and she fared forth with the merchant preceding her. But when folk saw her, all wondered at her beauty and exclaimed, ""Blessed be Allah, the most excellent Creator! O lucky the man in whose house the hall be!"" And the trader ceased not walking (and she behind him) till they entered the palace of Sultan Sharrkan; when he sought an audience and, kissing the earth between his hands, said, ""O auspicious King, I have brought thee a rare gift, unmatched in this time and richly gifted with beauty and with good qualities."" Quoth the King, ""Let me see it."" So the merchant went out and brought her, she following him till he made her stand before King Sharrkan. When he beheld her, blood yearned to blood, though she had been parted from him in childhood and though he had never seen her, having only heard a long time after her birth that he had a sister called Nuzhat al- Zaman and a brother Zau al-Makan, he having been jealous of them, because of the succession. And such was the cause of his knowing little about them. Then, having placed her before the presence, the merchant said, ""O King of the age, besides being peerless in her time and beauty and loveliness, she is also versed in all learning, sacred and profane, including the art of government and the abstract sciences."" Quoth the King to the trader, ""Take her price, according as thou boughtest her, and go thy ways."" ""I hear and I obey,"" replied the merchant; ""but first write me a patent, exempting me for ever from paying tithe on my merchandise."" Said the King, ""I will do this, but first tell me what price thou paidest for her."" Said the merchant, ""I bought her for an hundred thousand diners, and her clothes cost me another hundred thousand."" When the Sultan heard these words, he declared, ""I will give thee a higher price than this for her;"" and, calling his treasurer, said to him, ""Pay this merchant three hundred and twenty thousand ducats; so will he have an hundred and twenty thousand diners profit."" Thereupon the Sultan summoned the four Kazis and paid him the money in their presence and then he said, ""I call you to witness that I free this my slave girl and purpose to marry her."" So the Kazis wrote out the deed of emancipation and the contract of marriage, when the Sultan scattered much gold on the heads of those present; and the pages and the eunuchs picked up this largesse. Then, after paying him his monies, Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a perpetual patent, exempting him from toll, tax or tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding each and every in all his government to molest him, and lastly bestowed on him a splendid dress of honour.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Sixtieth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Sharrkan bade them write for the merchant a mandate, after paying him his monies; and they wrote a perpetual patent, exempting him from the tithe upon his merchandise and forbidding any in his government to molest him; and lastly bestowed upon him a splendid dress of honour. Then all about him retired, and none remained save the Kazis and the merchant, whereupon said he to the judges, ""I wish you to hear such discourse from this damsel as may prove her knowledge and accomplishments in all aimed for her by this trader, that we ascertain the truth of his assertions."" They answered, ""There is no evil in that!""; and he commanded the curtain to be let down between him and those with him and the maiden and those with her; and the women about the damsel behind the curtains began to wish her joy and kiss her hands and feet, when they learned that she was become the King's wife. Then they came round her and took off her dresses easing her of the weight of her clothes and began to look upon her beauty and loveliness. Presently the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs heard that King Sharrkan had bought a hand maiden unmatched for her beauty and learning and philosophy and account keeping, and versed in all branches of knowledge, that he had paid for her three hundred and twenty thousand dinars, and that he had set her free and had written a marriage contract with her and had summoned the four Kazis to make trial of her, how she would answer all their questions and hold disputetion with them. So they asked leave of their husbands and repaired to the palace wherein was Nuzhat al- Zaman. When they came in to her, they found the eunuchs standing before her; and, as soon as she saw the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees of the realm coming to call upon her, she arose to them on her feet and met them with courtesy, her handmaidens standing behind her, and she received them saying, ""Ye be welcome!"" The while she smiled in their faces so as to win their hearts; and she promised them all manner of good and seated them in their proper stations, as if she had been brought up with them; so all wondered at her beauty and loveliness and said to one another, ""This damsel is none other than a Queen, the daughter of a King."" Then they sat down, magnifying her worth and said to her, ""O our lady, this our city is illumined by thee, and our country and abode and birth place and reign are honoured by thy presence. The kingdom indeed is thy kingdom and the palace is thy palace, and we all are thy handmaids; so, by Allah, do not shut us out from thy favours and the sight of thy beauty."" And she thanked them for this. All this while the curtains were let down between Nuzhat al-Zaman and the women with her, on the one side, and King Sharrkan and the four Kazis and the merchant seated by him on the other. Presently King Sharrkan called to her and said, ""O Queen, the glory of thine age, this merchant hath described thee as being learned and accomplished; and he claimeth that thou art skilled in all branches of knowledge, even to astrology: so let us hear something of all this he hath mentioned, and favour us with a short discourse on such subjects."" She replied, saying: ""O King, to hear is to obey. The first subjects whereof I will treat are the art of government and the duties of Kings and what behoveth governors of command meets according to religious law, and what is incumbent on them in respect of satisfactory speech and manners. Know then, O King, that all men's works tend either to religious or to laical life, for none attaineth to religion save through this world, because it is the best road to futurity. Now the works of this world are not ordered save by the doings of its people, and men's doings are divided into four divisions, government, commerce, husbandry and craftsmanship. Now government requireth perfect administration with just and true judgment; for government is the pivot of the edifice of the world, which world is the road to futurity; since Allah Almighty hath made the world for His servants as viaticum to the traveller for the attainment of his goal; and it befitteth each man that he receive of it such measure as shall bring him to Allah, and that he follow not herein his own mind and his individual lust. If folk would take of worldly goods with justice and equity, all cause of contention would be cut off; but they take thereof with violence ant after their own desires, and their persistence therein giveth rise to contentions; so they have need of the Sultan, that he do justice between them and order their affairs; and, if the King restrain not his folk from one another, the strong will drive the weak to the wall. Hence Ardeshir saith, 'Religion and Kingship be twins'; religion is a hidden treasure and the King is its keeper; and the Divine Ordinances and men's intelligence point out that it behoveth the people to adopt a Sultan who shall withhold oppressor from oppressed and do the weak justice against the strong and restrain the violence of the proud and the rebels against rule. For know, O King, that according to the measure of the Sultan's good morals, even so will be the time; as saith the Apostle of Allah (on whom be peace and salvation!), 'There be two classes who, if they be good, the people will be good; and if they be bad, the people will be bad, even the Olema and the Emirs.' And it is said by a certain sage, 'There be three kinds of Kings, the King of the Faith, the King who protecteth things to which reverence is due, and the King of his own lusts.' The King of the Faith obligeth his subjects to follow their faith, and it behoveth he be the most faithful, for it is by him that they take pattern in the things of the Faith; and it becometh the folk to obey him in whatso he commandeth according to Divine Ordinance; but he shall hold the discontented in the same esteem as the contented, because of submission to the decrees of Destiny. As for the King who protecteth things to be reverenced, he upholdeth the things of the Faith and of the World and compelleth his folk to follow the Divine Law and to preserve the rights of humanity; and it fitteth him to unite Pen and Sword; for whoso declineth from what Pen hath written his feet slip and the King shall rectify his error with the sharp Sword and dispread his justice over all mankind. As for the King of his own lusts, he hath no religion but the following his desire and, as he feareth not the wrath of his Lord who set him on the throne, so his Kingdom inclineth to deposition and the end of his pride is in the house of perdition. And sages say, 'The King hath need of many people, but the people have need of but one King' wherefore it beseemeth that he be well acquainted with their natures, that he reduce their discord to concord, that with his justice be encompass them all and with his bounties overwhelm them all. And know, O King, that Ardeshir, styled Jamr Shadíd, or the Live Coal, third of the Kings of Persia, conquered the whole world and divided it into four divisions and, for this purpose, get for himself four seal rings, one for each division. The first seal was that of the sea and the police of prohibition and on it was written, Alterna lives. The second was the seal of tribute and of the receipt of monies, and on it was written, Building up. The third was the seal of the provisioning department and on it was written, Plenty. The fourth was the seal of the oppressed, and on it was written, Justice. And these usages remained valid in Persia until the revelation of Al-Islam. Chosroës also wrote his son, who was with the army, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee.'—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Sixty-first night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Chosroës wrote his son, 'Be not thou too open handed with thy troops, or they will be too rich to need thee; nor be thou niggardly with them, or they will murmur against thee. Give thy giving deliberately and confer thy favours advisedly; open thy hand to them in time of success and stint them not in time of distress.' There is a legend that a desert Arab came once to the Caliph Al- Mansúr and said, 'Starve thy dog and he shall follow thee.' When the Caliph heard his words, he was enraged with the Arab, but Abu 'l-Abbás of Tús said to him, 'I fear that if some other than thou should show him a scone, the dog would follow him and leave thee alone.' Thereupon the Caliph Al-Mansur's wrath subsided and he knew that the wild Arab had intended no offence and ordered him a present. And know, O King, that Abd al-Malik bin Marwán wrote to his brother Abd al-Azíz, when he despatched him to Egypt, as follows, 'Pay heed to thy Secretaries and thy Chamberlains, for the Secretaries will acquaint thee with estate fished matters and the Chamberlains with matters of official ceremony, whilst thine expenditure will make thy troops known to thee.' Omar bin Al-Khattáb (whom Allah accept!) when engaging a servant was in the habit of conditioning him with four conditions; the first that he should not ride the baggage beasts, the second that he should not wear fine clothes, the third that he should not eat of the spoil and the fourth that he should not put off praying till after the proper period. It is said that there is no wealth more profitable than understanding, and there is no understanding like common sense and prudence, and there is no prudence like piety; that there is no means of drawing near to God like good morals, no measure like good breeding, no traffic like good works and no profit like earning the Divine favour; that there is no temperance like standing within the limits of the law, no science like that of meditation, no worship like obeying the Divine commends, no faith like modesty, no calculation like self abasement and no honour like knowledge. So guard the head and what it containeth and the belly and what it compriseth; and think of death and doom ere it ariseth. Saith Ali (whose face Allah honour!), 'Beware of the wickedness of women and be on thy guard against them: consult them not in aught; but grudge not complaisance to them, lest they greed for intrigue.' And eke quoth he, 'Whoso leaveth the path of moderation his wits become perplexed'; and there be rules for this which we will mention, if it be Allah's will. And Omar (whom Allah accept!) saith, 'There are three kinds of women, firstly the true believing, Heaven fearing, love full and fruit full, who helpeth her mate against fate, not helping fate against her mate; secondly, she who loveth her children but no more and, lastly, she who is a shackle Allah setteth on the neck of whom He will.' Men be also three: the wise when he exerciseth his own judgement; the wiser who, when befalleth somewhat whereof he knoweth not the issue, seeketh folk of good counsel and acteth by their advice; and the unwise irresolute ignoring the right way nor heeding those who would guide him straight. Justice is indispensable in all things; even slave girls have need of justice; and men quote as an instance highway robbers who live by violenting mankind, for did they not deal equitably among themselves and observe justice in dividing their booty, their order would fall to pieces. In short, for the rest, the Prince of noble qualities is Beneficence cum Benevolence; and how excellent is the saying of the poet,
By open hand and ruth the youth rose to his tribe's command; * Go and do likewise for the same were easy task to thee.'
And quoth another,
'In ruth and mildness surety lies and mercy wins respect, * And
             Truth is best asylum for the man of soothfast soul:
Whoso for wealth of gold would win and wear the world's good
             word, * On glory's course must ever be the first to gain the
             goal.'""
And Nazhat al-Zaman discoursed upon the policy of Kings till the bystanders said, ""Never have we seen one reason of rule and government like this damsel! Haply she will let us hear some discourse upon subject other than this."" When she heard their words and understood them she said, ""As for the chapter of good breeding, it is wide of comprehension, being a compend of things perfect. Now it so happened that one day there came to the Caliph Mu'áwiyah one of his companions, who mentioned the people of Irak and the goodness of their wit; and the Caliph's wife Maysún, mother of Yezíd, heard his words. So, when he was gone, she said to the Caliph, 'O Prince of the Faithful, I would thou let some of the people of Irak come in and talk to thee, that I may hear their discourse.' Therewith Mu'awiyah said to his attendants, 'See who is at the door?' And they answered, 'The Banu Tamim.' 'Let them come in,' said he. So they came in and with them Al-Ahnáf son of Kays. Then quoth Mu'awiyah, 'Enter, O Abu Bahr,' and drew a curtain between himself and Maysun, that she might hear what they said without being seen herself; then he said to Al-Ahnaf, 'O Son of the Sea, draw near and tell me what counsel thou hast for me.' Quoth Al-Ahnaf, 'Part thy hair and trim thy moustachio and pare thy nails and pluck thine armpits and shave thy pubes and ever use the toothstick because therein be two and seventy virtues, and make the Ghusl or complete ablution on Friday, as an expiation for all between the Fridays.'—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Sixty-second Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Ahnaf bin Kays replied to Al-Mu'awiyah's question, 'And ever use the toothstick, because therein be two end seventy virtues and make the complete Friday ablution as an expiation for all between the two Fridays.' Quoth Mu'awiyah, 'What is thy counsel to thyself?' 'To set my feet firmly on the ground, to move them deliberately and watch over them with mine eyes!' 'How dost thou order thyself when thou goest in to one not of the nobles of thy tribe?' 'I lower mine eyes modestly and I salute first; I avoid what concerneth me not and I spare my words!' 'And how when thou goest in to thine equals?' 'I give ear to them when they speak and I do not assail them when they err!' 'When thou goest in to thy chiefs?' 'I salute without making any sign and await the reply: if they bid me draw near, I draw near, and if they draw off from me I withdraw!' 'How dost thou with thy wife?' Quoth Ahnaf, 'Excuse me from answering this, O Commander of the Faithful!'; but Mu'awiyah cried, 'I conjure thee inform me.' He said, 'I entreat her kindly and show her familiarity and am large in expenditure, for woman was created of a crooked rib.' 'And how dost thou when thou hast a mind to lie with her?' 'I bid her perfume herself and kiss her till she is moved to desire; then, should it be as thou knowest, I throw her on her back. If the seed abide in her womb I say, 'O Allah make it blessed and let it not be a wastrel, but fashion it into the best of fashions!' Then I rise from her to ablution and first I pour water over my hands and then over my body and lastly, I praise Allah for the joy He hath given me.' Said Mu'awiyah, 'Thou hast answered right well and now tell me what be thy requirements?' Said Ahnaf, 'I would have thee rule thy subjects in the fear of Allah and do even handed justice between them.' Thereupon Ahnaf rose to his feet and left the Caliph's presence, and when he had gone Maysun said, 'Were there but this man in Irak, he would suffice to it.' Then continued Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""And all this is a section of the chapter of good breeding, and know O King, that Muaykib was intendant of the public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khattáb,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Sixty-third Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, ""Know, O King, that Mu'aykib was intendant of the public treasury during the Caliphate of Omar bin al-Khattab; and it so befel him that he saw Omar's son and gave him a dirham out of the treasury. Thereupon, quoth Mu'aykib, 'I returned to my own house, and while I was sitting there behold, a messenger came to me from Omar and I was afraid and went to him, and when I came into his presence, in his hand was the dirham I had given his son. He said to me, 'Woe to thee Mu'aykib! I have found somewhat concerning thy soul.' I asked 'And what is that?'; and he answered, 'It is that thou hast shown thyself a foe to the followers of Mohammed (on whom be peace and salvation!) in the matter of this dirham, and thou wilt have to account for it on Resurrection Day.' And Omar also wrote a letter to Abú Músá al-Ashári as follows, 'When these presents reach thee, give the people what is theirs and remit to me the rest.' And he did so. Now when Othman succeeded to the Caliphate, he wrote a like letter to Abu Musa, who did his bidding and sent him the tribute accordingly, and with it came Ziyád. And when Ziyad laid the tribute before Othman, the Caliph's son came in and took a dirham, whereupon Ziyad shed tears. Othman asked 'Why weepest thou?'; and Ziyad answered, 'I once brought Omar bin al-Khattab the like of this and his son took a dirham, where upon Omar bade snatch it from his hand. Now thy son hath taken of the tribute, yet I have seen none say aught to him or snatch the money from him.' Then Othman cried, 'And where wilt thou find the like of Omar?' Again Zayd bin Aslam relates of his father that he said, 'I went out one night with Omar till we approached a blazing fire. Quoth Omar, 'O Aslam, I think these must be travellers who are suffering from the cold. Come, let us join them.' So we walked on till we came to them and behold! we found a woman who had lighted a fire under a cauldron and by her side were two children, both a wailing. Said Omar, 'Peace be with you, O folk of light (for it was repugnant to him to say 'folk of fire'), what aileth you?' Said she, 'The cold and the night trouble us.' He asked, 'What aileth these little people that they weep?'; and she answered, 'They are hungry.' He enquired, 'And what is in this cauldron?'; and she replied, 'It is what I quiet them withal, and Allah will question Omar bin al- Khattab of them, on the Day of Doom.' He said, 'And what should Omar know of their case?' 'Why then,' rejoined she, 'should he manage people's affairs and yet be unmindful of them?' Thereupon Omar turned to me (continned Aslam) and cried, 'Come with us!' So we set off running till we reached the pay department of his treasury, where he took out a sack containing flour and a pot holding fat and said to me, 'Load these on my back!' Quoth I, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I will carry them for thee.' He rejoined, 'Wilt thou bear my load for me on the Day of Resurrection?' So I put the things on his back, and we set off, running, till we threw down the sack hard by her. Then he took out some of the flour and put it in the cauldron; and, saying to the woman, 'Leave it to me,' he began blowing the fire under the cauldron. Now he was a long bearded man and I saw the smoke issuing from between the hairs of his beard till the flour was cooked, when he took some of the fat and threw it in and said to the woman, 'Bed them while I cool it for them.' So they fell to eating till they had eaten their fill, and he left the rest with her. Then he turned to me and said, 'O Aslam, I see it was indeed hunger made them weep; and I am glad I did not go away ere I found out the cause of the light I saw.'—And Shahrazad per ceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Sixty-fourth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, ""It is related that Omar passed by a flock of sheep, kept by a Mameluke, and asked him to sell him a sheep. He answered, 'They are not mine.' 'Thou art the man I sought,' said Omar, and bought him and freed him; whereupon the slave exclaimed, 'O Allah, as thou hast bestowed on me the lesser emancipation; so vouchsafe me the greater!' It is also said that Omar bin al- Khattab was wont to give his servants sweet milk and himself eat coarse fare, and to clothe them softly and himself wear rough garments. He rendered unto all men their due, and exceeded in his giving to them. He once gave a man four thousand dirhams and added thereto a thousand, wherefore it was said to him, 'Why dost thou not increase to thy son as thou increasest to this man?' He answered, 'This man's father stood firm at the battle day of Ohod.' Al-Hasan relates that Omar once came back from foray with much money, and that Hafsah approached him and said, 'O Commander of the Faithful, the due of kinship!' 'O Hafsah!' replied he, 'verily Allah hath enjoined us to satisfy the dues of kinship, but not with the monies of the True Believers. Indeed, thou pleasest"" thy family, but thou angerest thy father.' And she went away trailing her skirts. The son of Omar said, 'I implored the Lord to show me my father one year after his death, till at last I saw him wiping the sweat from his brow and asked him, 'How is it with thee, O my father?' He answered, 'But for my Lord's mercy thy father surely had perished.' Then said Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""Hear, O auspicious King, the second division of the first chapter of the instances of the followers of the Apostle and other holy men. Saith Al Hasan al-Basrí, Not a soul of the sons of Adam goeth forth of the world without regretting three things,- failure to enjoy what he hath amassed, failure to compass what he hoped, failure to provide himself with sufficient viaticum for that hereto he goeth. It was said of Sufyan, 'Can a man be a religious and yet possess wealth?' He replied, 'Yes, so he be patient when grieved and be thankful when he hath received.' Abdullah bin Shaddád, being about to die, sent for his son Mohammed and admonished him, saying, 'O my son, I see the Summoner of Death summoning me, and so I charge thee to fear Allah both in public and private, to praise Allah and to be soothfastin thy speech, for such praise bringeth increase of prosperity, and piety in itself is the best of provision for the next world; even as saith one of the poets,
'I see not happiness lies in gathering gold; * The man most pious
is man happiest:
In truth the fear of God is best of stores, * And God shall make
the pious choicely blest.'
Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""Let the King also give ear to these notes from the second section of the first chapter."" He asked her 'What be they?'; and she answered, ""When Omar bin Abd al-Azíz succeeded to the Caliphate, he went to his household and laying hands on all that was in their hold, put it into the public treasury. So the Banu Umayyah flew for aid to his father's sister, Fátimah, daughter of Marwan, and she sent to him saying, 'I must needs speak to thee.' So she came to him by night and, when he had made her alight from her beast and sit down, he said to her, 'O aunt, it is for thee to speak first, since thou hast some thing to ask: tell me then what thou wouldst with me.' Replied she, 'O Commander of the Faithful, it is thine to speak first, for thy judgment perceiveth that which is hidden from the intelligence of others.' Then said Omar, 'Of a verity Allah Almighty sent Mohammed as a blessing to some and a bane to others; and He elected for him those with him, and commissioned him as His Apostle and took him to Himself,'—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Sixty-fifth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued thus, ""Said Omar, 'Verily Allah commissioned as His Apostle Mohammed (upon whom be the benediction of Allah and His salvation!), for a blessing to some and a bane to others; and He elected for him those with him and took him to Himself, leaving the people a stream whereof they might drink. After him Abu Bakr the Truth teller became Caliph and he left the river as it was, doing what was pleasing to Allah. Then arose Omar and worked a work and strove in holy war and strife where of none might do the like. But when Othman arose to power he diverted a streamlet from the stream, and Mu'awiyah in his turn diverted from it several streamlets; and without ceasing in like manner, Yezid and the Banu Marwán such as Abd al-Malik and Walíd and Sulaymán drew away water from the stream, and the main course dried up, till rule devolved upon me, and now I am minded to restore the stream to its normal condition.' When Fatimah heard this, she said, 'I came wishing only to speak and confer with thee, but if this be thy word, I have nothing to say to thee.' Then she returned to the Ommiades and said to them, 'Now take ye the consequences of your act when ye allied yourselves by marriage with Omar bin al-Khattab.' And it is also said that when Omar was about to die, he gathered his children round him, and Maslamah bin Abd al-Malik said to him, 'O Prince of the Faithful, how wilt thou leave thy children paupers and thou their protector? None can hinder thee in thy lifetime from giving them what will suffice them out of the treasury; and this indeed were better than leaving the good work to him who shall rule after thee.' Omar looked at him with a look of wrath and wonder and presently replied, 'O Maslamah, I have defended them from this sin all the days of my life, and shall I make them miserable after my death? Of a truth my sons are like other men, either obedient to Almighty Allah who will prosper them, or disobedient and I will not help them in their disobedience. Know, O Maslamah, that I was present, even as thou, when such an one of the sons of Marwanwas buried, and I fell asleep by him and saw him in a dream given over to one of the punishments of Allah, to whom belong Honour and Glory! This terrified me and made me tremble, and I vowed to Allah, that if ever I came to power, I would not do such deeds as the dead man had done. I have striven to fulfil this vow all the length of my life and I hope to die in the mercy of my Lord.' Quoth Maslamah, 'A certain man died and I was present at his burial, and when all was over I fell asleep and I saw him as a sleeper seeth a dream, walking in a garden of flowing waters clad in white clothes. He came up to me and said: 'O Maslamah, it is for the like of this that rulers should rule.' Many are the instances of this kind, and quoth one of the men of authority, 'I used to milk the ewes in the Caliphate of Omar bin Abd al-Aziz, and one day I met a shepherd, among whose sheep I saw a wolf or wolves. I thought them to be dogs, for I had never before seen wolves; so I asked, 'What dost thou with these dogs?' 'They are not dogs, but wolves,' answered the shepherd. Quoth I, 'Can wolves be with sheep and not hurt them?' Quoth he, 'When the head is whole, the body is whole.' Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once preached from a pulpit of clay and, after praising and glorifying Allah Almighty, said three words as follows, 'O folk, make clean your inmost hearts, that your outward lives may be dean to your brethren, and abstain ye from the things of the world. Know that between us and Adam there is no one man alive among the dead. Dead are Abd al- Malik and those who forewent him, and Omar also shall die and those who forewent him.' Asked Maslamah, 'O Commander of the Faithful, an we set a pillow behind thee, wilt thou lean on it a little while?' But Omar answered, 'I fear lest it be a fault about my neck on Resurrection Day.' Then he gasped with the death rattle and fell back in a faint; whereupon Fatimah cried out, saying, 'Ho, Maryam! Ho, Muzahim! Ho, such an one! Look to this man!' And she began to pour water on him weeping, till he revived from his swoon; and, seeing her in tears said to her, 'What causeth thee to weep, O Fatimah?' She replied, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I saw thee lying prostrate before us and thought of thy prostration in death before Almighty Allah, of thy departure from the world and of thy separation from us. This is what made me weep.' Answered he, 'Enough, O Fatimah, for indeed thou exceedest.' Then he would have risen, but fell down and Fatimah strained him to her and said, 'Thou art to me as my father and my mother, O Commander of the Faithful! We cannot speak to thee, all of us.' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman to her brother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, ""Here endeth the second section of the first chapter.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Sixty-sixth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman said to her brother Sharrkan and the four Kazis, ""Here endeth the second section of the first chapter. And it so happened that Omar bin Abd al-Aziz wrote to the people of the festival at Meccah as follows, 'I call Allah to witness, in the Holy Month, in the Holy City and on the day of the Greater Pilgrimage, that I am innocent of your oppression and of his wrongs that doth wrong you, in that I have neither commanded this nor purposed it, neither hath any report of aught thereof hitherto reached me, nor have I compassed any knowledge thereof; and I trust that a cause for pardon will be found in that none hath authority from me to oppress any man, for I shall assuredly be questioned concerning every one oppress. And if any of my officers swerve from the right and act otherwise than the Holy Book and the Traditions of the Apostle do authorise, obey him not so that he may return to the way of righteousness.' He said also (Allah accept of him!), 'I do not wish to be relieved from death, because it is the supreme thing for which the True Believer is rewarded.' Quoth one of authority, 'I went to the Prince of the Faithful, Omarbin Abd al-Aziz, who was then Caliph, and saw before him twelve dirhams, which he ordered for deposit in the public treasury. So I said to him, 'O Commander of the Faithful, thou impoverishest thy children and reducest them to beggary having nothing whereon to live. An thou wouldst appoint somewhat by will to them and to those who are poor of the people of thy house, it were well.' 'Draw near to me,' answered he: so I drew near to him and he said, 'Now as for thy saying, 'Thou beggarest thy children; provide for them and for the poor of thy household,' it is without reason; for Allah of a truth will replace me to my children and to the poor of my house, and He will be their guardian. Verily, they are like other men; he who feareth Allah, right soon will Allah provide for him a happy issue, and he that is addicted to sins, I will not up hold him in his sin against Allah.' Then he summoned his sons who numbered twelve, and when he beheld them his eyes dropped tears and presently he said to them, 'Your Father is between two things; either ye will be well to do, and your parent will enter the fire, or ye will be poor and your parent will enter Paradise; and your father's entry into Paradise is liefer to him than that ye should be well to do. So arise and go, Allah be your helper, for to Him I commit your affairs!' Khálid bin Safwán said, 'Yúsuf bin Omar accompanied me to Hishám bin Abd al-Malik, and as I met him he was coming forth with his kinsmen and attendants. He alighted and a tent was pitched for him. When the people had taken their seats, I came up to the side of the carpet whereon he sat reclining and looked at him; and, waiting till my eyes met his eyes, bespoke him thus, 'May Allah fulfil His bounty to thee, O Commander of the Faithful, I have an admonition for thee, which hath come down to us from the history of the Kings preceding thee!' At this, he sat up whenas he had been reclining and said to me, 'Bring what thou hast, O son of Safwan!' Quoth I, 'O Commander of the Faithful, one of the Kings before thee went forth in a time before this thy time, to this very country and said to his companions, 'Saw ye ever any state like mine and say me, hath such case been given to any man even as it hath been given unto me?' Now there was with him a man of those who survive to bear testimony to Truth; upholders of the Right and wayfarers in its highway, and he said to him, 'O King, thou askest of a grave matter. Wilt thou give me leave to answer?' 'Yes,' replied the King, and the other said, 'Dost thou judge thy present state to be short lasting or ever lasting?' 'It is temporary,' replied the King. 'How then,' rejoined the man, 'do I see thee exulting in that which thou wilt enjoy but a little while and whereof thou wilt be questioned for a long while and for the rendering an account whereof thou shalt be as a pledge which is pawned?' Quoth the King, 'Whither shall I flee and what must I seek for me?' 'That thou abide in thy kingship,' replied the other, 'or else robe thee in rags and apply thyself to obey Almighty Allah thy Lord until thine appointed hour. I will come to thee again at daybreak.' Khalid bin Safwan further relates that the man knocked at the door at dawn and behold, the King had put off his crown and resolved to become an anchorite, for the stress of his exhortation. When Hishám bin Abd al-Malik heard this, he wept till his beard was wet, and, bidding his rich apparel be put off, shut himself up in his palace. Then the grandees and dependents came to Khalid and said, 'What is this thou hast done with the Commander of the Faithful? Thou hast troubled his pleasure and disturbed his life!' Then quoth Nuzhat al-Zaman, addressing herself to Sharrkan, ""How many instances of admonition are there not in this chapter! Of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Sixty-seventh Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman continued, speaking to Sharrkan, ""Know, O King, that in this chapter be so many instances of admonition that of a truth I cannot report all appertaining to this head in a single sitting but, with length of days, O King of the age, all will be well."" There said the Kazis, ""O King, of a truth this damsel is the wonder of the world, and of our age the unique pearl! Never heard we her like in the length of time or in the length of our lives."" And they called down blessings on the King and went away. Then Sharrkan turned to his attendants and said, ""Begin ye to prepare the marriage festival and make ready food of all kinds."" So they forthright did his bidding as regards the viands, and he commanded the wives of the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees depart not until the time of the wedding banquet and of the unveiling of the bride. Hardly came the period of afternoon prayer when the tables were spread with whatso heart can desire or eye can delight in of roast meats and geese and fowls; and the subjects ate till they were satisfied. Moreover, Sharrkan had sent for all the singing women of Damascus and they were present, together with every slave girl of the King and of the notables who knew how to sing. And they went up to the palace in one body. When the evening came and darkness starkened they lighted candles, right and left, from the gate of the citadel to that of the palace; and the Emirs and Wazirs and Grandees marched past before King Sharrkan, whilst the singers and the tire women took the damsel to dress and adorn her, but found she needed no adornment. Meantime King Sharrkan went to the Hammam and coming out, sat down on his seat of estate, whilst they paraded the bride before him in seven different dresses: after which they eased her of the weight of her raiment and ornaments and gave such injunctions as are enjoined upon virgins on their wedding nights. Then Sharrkan went in unto her and took her maidenhead; and she at once conceived by him and, when she announced it, he rejoiced with exceeding joy and commanded the savants to record the date of her conception. On the morrow he went forth and seated himself on his throne, and the high officers came in to him and gave him joy. Then he called his private secretary and bade him write a letter to his father, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, saying that he had bought him a damsel, who excels in learning and good breeding and who is mistress of all kinds of knowledge. Moreover he wrote, ""There is no help but that I send her to Baghdad to visit my brother Zau al-Makan and my sister Nuzhat al-Zaman. I have set her free and married her and she hath conceived by me."" And he went on to praise her wit and salute his brother and sister together with the Wazir Dandan and all the Emirs. Then he sealed the letter and despatched it to his father by a post courier who was absent a whole month, after which time he returned with the answer and presented it in the presence. Sharrkan took it and read as follows, ""After the usual Bismillah, this is from the afflicted distracted man, from him who hath lost his children and home by bane and ban, King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, to his son Sharrkan. Know that, since thy departure from me, the place is become contracted upon me, so that no longer I have power of patience nor can I keep my secret: and the cause thereof is as follows. It chanced that when I went forth to hunt and course Zau al-Makan sought my leave to fare Hijaz wards, but I, fearing for him the shifts of fortune, forbade him therefrom until the next year or the year after. My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Sixty-eighth night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omar bin al-Nu'uman wrote in his letter, ""My absence while sporting and hunting endured for a whole month, and when I returned I found that thy brother and sister had taken somewhat of money and had set out with the pilgrim caravan for pilgrimage by stealth. When I knew this, the wide world narrowed on me, O my son! but I awaited the return of the caravan, hoping that haply they would come back with it. Accordingly, when the palmers appeared I asked concerning the twain, but they could give me no news of them; so I donned mourning for them, being heavy at heart, and in sleep I have no part and I am drowned in the tears of my eyes."" Then he wrote in verse,
""That pair in image quits me not one single hour, * Whom in my
             heart's most honourable place I keep:
Sans hope of their return I would not live one hour, * Without my
             dreams of them I ne'er would stretch me in sleep.""
The letter went on, ""And after the usual salutations to thee and thine, I command thee neglect no manner of seeking news of them for indeed this is a shame to us."" When Sharrkan read the letter he felt grief for his father and joy for the loss of his brother and sister. Then he took the missive and went in with it to Nuzhat al-Zaman who knew not that he was her brother, nor he that she was his sister, albeit he often visited her both by night and by day till the months were accomplished and she sat down on the stool of delivery. Allah made the child birth easy to her and she bare a daughter, whereupon she sent for Sharrkan and seeing him she said to him, ""This is thy daughter: name her as thou wilt."" Quoth he, ""It is usual to name children on the seventh day after birth."" Then he bent over the child to kiss it and he saw, hung about its neck, a jewel, which he knew at once for one of those which Princess Abrizah had brought from the land of the Greeks. Now when he saw the jewel hanging from his babe's neck he recognised it right well, his senses fled and wrath seized on him; his eyes rolled in rage and he looked at Nuzhat al- Zaman and said to her, ""Whence hadst thou this jewel, O slave girl?"" When she heard this from Sharrkan she replied, ""I am thy lady, and the lady of all in thy palace! Art thou not ashamed to say to me Slave girl? I am a Queen, daughter of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman."" Hearing this, he was seized with trembling and hung his head earthwards,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Sixty-ninth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan heard these words, his heart fluttered and his colour waxed yellow and he was seized with trembling and he hung his head earthwards, for he knew that she was his sister by the same father. Then he lost his senses; and, when he revived, he abode in amazement, but did not discover his identity to her and asked, O my lady, say, art thou in sooth the daughter of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman?"" ""Yes,"" answered she; and he continued, ""Tell me the cause of thy leaving thy sire and of thy being sold for a slave."" So she related to him all that had befallen her from beginning to end, how she had left her brother sick in the Sanctified City, Jerusalem, and how the Badawi had kidnapped her and had sold her to the trader. When Sharrkan heard this, he was certified of her being his sister on the sword side and said to himself, ""How can I have my sister to wife? By Allah, needs must I marry her to one of my chamberlains; and, if the thing get wind, I will declare that I divorced her before consummation and married her to my Chief Chamberlain."" Then he raised his head and sighing said, ""O Nuzhat al-Zaman, thou art my very sister and I cry: 'I take refuge with Allah from this sin whereinto we have fallen,' for I am Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman."" She looked at him and knew he spoke the truth; and, becoming as one demented, she wept and buffeted her face, exclaiming, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah! Verily have we fallen into mortal sin! What shall I do and what shall I say to my father and my mother when they ask me, Whence hadst thou thy daughter?"" Quoth Sharrkan, ""It were meetest that I marry thee to my Chamberlain and let thee bring up my daughter in his house, that none may know thou be my sister. This hath befallen us from Almighty Allah for a purpose of his own, and nothing shall cover us but thy marriage with this Chamberlain, ere any know."" Then he fell to comforting her and kissing her head and she asked him, ""What wilt thou call the girl?"" ""Call her Kuzia Fakán,"" answered he. Then he gave the mother in marriage to the Chief Chamberlain, and transferred her to his house with the child, which they reared on the laps of the slave girls, and fed with milk and dosed with powders. Now all this occurred whilst the brother, Zau al-Makan, still tarried with the Fireman at Damascus. One day there came to King Sharrkan a courier from his father, with a letter which he took and read and found therein, ""After the Bismillah know, O beloved King, that I am afflicted with sore affliction for the loss of my children: sleep ever faileth me and wakefulness ever assaileth me. I send thee this letter that, as soon as thou receivest it, thou make ready the monies and the tribute, and send them to us, together with the damsel whom thou hast bought and taken to wife; for I long to see her and hear her discourse; more especially because there hath come to us from Roumland an old woman of saintly bearing and with her be five damsels high bosomed virgins, endowed with knowledge and good breeding and all arts and sciences befitting mortals to know; and indeed tongue faileth me to describe this old woman and these who with her wend; for of a truth they are compendiums of perfections in learning and accomplishments. As soon as I saw them I loved them, and I wished to have them in my palace and in the compass of my hand; for none of the Kings owneth the like of them; so I asked the old woman their price and she answered, 'I will not sell them but for the tribute of Damascus.' And I, by Allah, did not hold this price exorbitant, indeed it is but little, for each one of them is worth the whole valuation. So I agreed to that and took them into my palace, and they remain in my possession. Wherefore do thou forward the tribute to us that the woman may return to her own country; and send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors; and, if she prevail over them, I will return her to thee accompanied by the tribute of Baghdad.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Seventieth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that King Omar son of Al-Nu'uman said in his letter, ""And send to us the damsel to the end that she may dispute with them before the doctors and, if she prevail over them, I will return her to thee accompanied with the tribute of Baghdad."" As soon as Sharrkan knew the contents, he went in to his brother in law and said to him, ""Bring the damsel to whom I married thee;"" and when she came he showed her the letter and said, ""O my sister! what answer wouldst thou advise me make to this letter?"" Replied she, ""Seek advice from thyself!"" and presently added (for she yearned after her people and her native land), ""Send me together with my husband the Chamberlain, to Baghdad, that I may tell my father my tale and let him know whatso befel me with the Badawi who sold me to the merchant, and that I also inform him how thou boughtest me of the trader and gavest me in marriage to the Chamberlain, after setting me free."" ""Be it so,"" replied Sharrkan. Then Sharrkan took his daughter, Kuzia Fakan, and committed her to the charge of the wet nurses and the eunuchs, and he made ready the tribute in haste, bidding the Chamberlain travel with the Princess and the treasure to Baghdad. He also furnished him two travelling litters one for himself and the other for his wife. And the Chamberlain replied, ""To hear is to obey."" Moreover Sharrkan collected camels and mules and wrote a letter to his father and committed it to the Chamberlain; then he bade farewell to his sister, after he had taken the jewel from her and hung it round his daughter's neck by a chain of pure gold; and she and her husband set out for Baghdad the same night. Now it so happened that Zau al-Makan and his friend the Fireman had come forth from the hut in which they were, to see the spectacle, and they beheld camels and Bukhti dromedaries and bât-mules and torches and lanterns alight; and Zau al-Makan enquired about the loads and their owner and was told that it was the tribute of Damascus going to King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of the City of Baghdad. He then asked, ""Who be the leader of the caravan?"" and they answered, ""The Head Chamberlain who hath married the damsel so famous for learning and science."" Thereupon Zau al-Makan wept with bitter weeping and was minded of his mother and his father and his sister and his native land, and he said to the Stoker, ""I will join this caravan and, little by little, will journey homewards."" Quoth the Fireman, ""I would not suffer thee to travel single handed from the Holy City to Damascus, then how shall I be sure of thy safety when thou farest for Baghdad? But I will go with thee and care for thee till thou effectest thine object."" ""With joy and good will,"" answered Zau al-Makan. Then the Fireman get him ready for the journey and hired an ass and threw saddle bags over it and put therein something of provaunt; and, when all was prepared, he awaited the passage of the caravan. And presently the Chamberlain came by on a dromedary and his footmen about him. Then Zau al-Ma ken mounted the ass and said to his companion, ""Do thou mount with me."" But he replied, ""Not so: I will be thy servant."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""There is no help for it but thou ride awhile."" ""'Tis well,"" quoth the Stoker; ""I will ride when I grow tired."" Then said Zau al-Makan, ""O my brother, soon shalt thou see how I will deal with thee, when I come to my own folk."" So they fared on till the sun rose and,When it was the hour of the noonday sleep the Chamberlain called a halt and they alighted and reposed and watered their camels. Then he gave the signal for departure and, after five days, they came to the city of Hamáh, where they set down and made a three days' halt;—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seventy-first Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they halted in the city of Hamah three days; they then fared forwards and ceased not travelling till they reached another city. Here also they halted three days and thence they travelled till they entered the province Diyár Bakr. Here blew on them the breezes of Baghdad, and Zau al-Makan bethought him of his father and mother and native land, and how he was returning to his sire without his sister: so he wept and sighed and complained, and his regrets grew on him, and he began improvising these couplets,
""Sweetheart! How long must I await by so long suffering teed? *
            Nor cometh messenger to tell me where thou dost abide:
Ah me! in very sooth our meeting time was short enow: * Would
            Heaven shorter prove to me the present parting-tide!
Now trend my hand and open my robe and thou within shall sight *
            How wasted are the limbs of me and yet the waste I hide:
When say they 'Comfort take for loss of love' I but reply * 'By
            Allah, till the Day of Doom no comfort shall betide!' ""
Thereupon said to him the Fireman, ""Leave this weeping and wailing, for we are near the Chamberlain's tent."" Quoth Zau al- Makan, ""Needs must I recite somewhat of verse; haply it may quench the fire of my heart."" ""Allah upon thee,"" cried the other, ""cease this lamentation till thou come to shine own country; then do what thou wilt, and I will be with thee wherever thou art."" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""By Allah! I cannot forbear from this!"" Then he turned his face towards Baghdad and the moon was shining brightly and shedding her light on the place, and Nuzhat al-Zaman could not sleep that night, but was restless and called to mind her brother and wept. And while she was in tears, he heard Zau al-Makan weeping and improvising the following distichs,
'Al-Yaman's leven-gleam I see, * And sore despair
            despaireth me
For friend who erst abode wi' me * Crowning my cup with gladdest
           gree:
It minds me o' one who jilted me * To mourn my bitter liberty.
Say sooth, thou fair sheet lightning! shall * We meet once more
           in joy and glee?
O blamer! spare to me thy blame * My Lord hath sent this dule to
            dree,
Of friend who left me, fain to flee; * Of Time that breeds
            calamity:
All bliss hath fled the heart of me * Since Fortune proved mine
            enemy.
He brimmed a bowl of merest pine, * And made me drain the
            dregs, did he:
I see me, sweetheart, dead and gone * Ere I again shall gaze on
           thee.
Time! prithee bring our childhood back, * Restore our happy
            infancy,
When joy and safety 'joyed we * From shafts that now they shoot
            at me!
Who aids the hapless stranger wight, * That nights in fright and
            misery,
That wastes his days in lonely grief, * For 'Time's
             Delight' no more must be?
Doomed us despite our will to bear * The hands of base bores cark
             and care.""
When he ended his verse he cried out and fell down in a fainting fit. This is how it fared with him; but as regards Nuzhat al- Zaman, when she heard that voice in the night, her heart was at rest and she rose and in her joy she called the Chief Eunuch, who said to her, ""What is thy will?"" Quoth she, ""Arise and bring me him who recited verses but now."" Replied he, ""Of a truth I did not hear him""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Seventy-second Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhat Al-Zaman heard her brother reciting, she called the Chief Eunuch and said to him, ""Go, fetch me the man who is repeating this poetry!"" Replied he, ""Of a truth I heard him not and I wot him not and folks are all sleeping."" But she said, ""Whomsoever thou seest awake, he is the reciter."" So he went, yet found none on wake save the Stoker; for Zau al-Makan was still insensible, and when his companion saw the Eunuch standing by his head he was afraid of him. Then said the Eunuch, ""Art thou he who repeated poetry but now and my lady heard him?"" The Stoker fancied that the dame was wroth with the reciter; and, being afraid, he replied, ""By Allah, 'twas not I!"" Rejoined the Eunuch, ""Who then was the reciter?: point him out to me. Thou must know who it was, seeing that thou art awake."" The Fireman feared for Zau al- Makan and said in himself, ""Haply the Eunuch will do him some hurt""; so he answered, ""By Allah, I know not who it was."" Said the Eunuch, ""By Allah, thou liest, for there is none on wake here but thou! So needs must thou know him."" ""By Allah,"" replied the Fireman, ""I tell thee the truth!: some passer by, some wayfarer must have recited the verses and disturbed me and kept me awake; Allah requite him!"" Quoth the Eunuch, ""If thou happen upon him, point him out to me and I will lay hands on him and bring him to the door of our lady's litter or do thou take him with thine own hand."" Said the Fireman, ""Go thou back and I will bring him to thee."" So the Eunuch left him and went his ways; and, going in to his mistress, told her all this and said to her, ""None knoweth who it was; it must have been some passer by, some wayfarer."" And she was silent. Meanwhile, Zau al-Makan came to himself and saw that the moon had reached the middle Heavens; the breath of the dawn breeze breathed upon him and his heart was moved to longing and sadness; so he cleared his throat and was about to recite verses, when the Fire man asked him, ""What wilt thou do?"" Answered Zau al-Makan, ""I have a mind to repeat somewhat of poetry, that I may quench therewith the fire of my heart."" Quoth the other, ""Thou knowest not what befel me whilst thou wast a faint, and how I escaped death only by beguiling the Eunuch."" ""Tell me what happened,"" quoth Zau al-Makan. Replied the Stoker, ""Whilst thou wast aswoon there came up to me but now an Eunuch, with a long staff of almond tree wood in his hand, who took to looking in all the people's faces, as they lay asleep, and asked me who it was recited the verses, finding none awake but myself. I told him in reply it was some passerby, some wayfarer; so he went away and Allah delivered me from him; else had he killed me. But first he said to me, 'If thou hear him again, bring him to us.'"" When Zau al-Makan heard this he wept and said, ""Who is it would forbid me to recite? I will surely recite, befal me what may; for I am near mine own land and care for none."" Rejoined the Fireman, ""Thy design is naught save to lose thy life;"" and Zau al-Makan retorted, ""Needs must I recite verses."" ""Verily,"" said the Stoker, ""needs must there be a parting between me and thee in this place, albeit;I had intended not to leave thee, till I had brought thee to thy native city and reunited thee with thy mother and father. Thou hast now tarried with me a year and a half and I have never harmed thee in aught. What ails thee, then, that thou must needs recite verses, seeing that we are tired out with walking and watching and all the folk are asleep, for they require sleep to rest them of their fatigue?"" But Zau al-Makan answered, ""I will not be turned away from my purpose."" Then grief moved him and he threw off concealment and began repeating these couplets,
""Stand thou by the homes and hail the lords of the ruined stead;
          * Cry thou for an answer, belike reply to thee shall be
           sped:
If the night and absence irk thy spirit kindle a torch * Wi'
           repine; and illuminate the gloom with a gleaming greed:
If the snake of the sand dunes hiss, I shall marvel not at all!
           * Let him bite so I bite those beauteous lips of the
           luscious red:
O Eden, my soul hath fled in despite of the maid I love: * Had I
           lost hope of Heaven my heart in despair were dead.""
And he also improvised the two following distichs,
""We were and were the days enthralled to all our wills, *
           Dwelling in union sweet and homed in fairest site:
Who shall restore the home of the beloved, where showed * Light
            of the Place for aye conjoined with Time's
            Delight?''
And as he ceased his verses, he shrieked three shrieks and fell senseless to the ground and the Fireman rose and covered him. When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard the first improvisation, she called to mind her father and her mother and her brother and their whilome home; then she wept and cried at the Eunuch and said to him, ""Woe to thee! He who recited the first time hath recited a second time and I heard him hard by. By Allah, an thou fetch him not to me, I will assuredly rouse the Chamberlain on thee, and he shall beat thee and cast thee out. But take these hundred diners and give them to the singer and bring him to me gently, and do him no hurt. If he refuse, hand to him this purse of a thousand diners, then leave him and return to me and tell me, after thou hast informed thyself of his place and his calling and what countryman he is. Return quickly and linger not.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seventy-third Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Nuzhat al- Zaman sent the Eunuch to make enquiries concerning the singer and said, ""Beware how thou come back to me and report, I could not find him."" So the Eunuch went out and laid about the people and trod in their tents, but found none awake, all being asleep for weariness, till he came to the Stoker and saw him sitting up, with his head uncovered. So he drew near and seizing him by the hand, said to him, ""It was thou didst recite the verses!"" The Fireman was afeard for his life and replied, ""No, by Allah, O chief of the people, it was not I!"" But the Eunuch said, ""I will not leave thee till thou show me who it was that recited the verses, for I dread returning to my lady without him."" Now when the Fireman heard these words he feared for Zau al-Makan and wept with exceeding weeping and said to the Eunuch, ""By Allah, it was not I, and I know him not. I only heard some passer by, some wayfarer, recite verses: so do not thou commit sin on me, for I am a stranger and come from the Holy City of Jerusalem; and Abraham, the friend of Allah, be with you all."" ""Rise up and fare with me,"" rejoined the Eunuch, ""and tell my lady this with thine own mouth, for I have seen none awake save thyself."" Quoth the Stoker, ""Hast thou not come and seen me sitting in the place where I now am, and dost thou not know my station? Thou wottest none can stir from his place, except the watchman seize him. So go thou to thy station and if thou again meet any one after this hour reciting aught of poetry, whether he be near or far, it will be I or some one I know, and thou shalt not learn of him but by me."" Then he kissed the Eunuch's head and spake him fair till he went away; but the Castrato fetched a round and, returning secretly, came and stood behind the Fireman, fearing to go back to his mistress without tidings. As soon as he was gone, the Stoker arose and aroused Zau al-Makan and said to him, ""Come, sit up, that I may tell thee what hath happened."" So Zau al-Makan sat up, and his companion told him what had passed, and he answered, ""Let me alone; I will take no heed of this and I care for none, for I am mine own country."" Quoth the Stoker, ""Why wilt thou obey thy flesh and the devil? If thou fear no one, I fear for thee and for my life, so Allah upon thee! recite nothing more of verses till thou come to thine own land. Indeed, I had not deemed thee so ill conditioned. Dost thou not know that this lady is the wife; of the Chamberlain and is minded to chastise thee for disturbing her? Belike, she is ill or restless for fatigue of the journey and the distance of the place from her home, and this is the second time she hath sent the Eunuch to look for thee."" However Zau al-Makan paid no heed to the Fireman's words but cried out a third time and began versifying with these couplets,
""I fly the carper's injury,* Whose carping sorely vexeth me:
He chides and taunts me, wotting not * He burns me but more
            grievously.
The blamer cries 'He is consoled!' * I say, 'My own dear
            land to see:'
They ask, 'Why be that land so dear?' * I say, 'It taught me in
            love to be:'
They ask, 'What raised its dignity?' * I say, 'What made my
            ignomy:'
Whate'er the bitter cup I drain, * Far be fro' me that land to
             flee:
Nor will I bow to those who blame, * And for such love would deal
             me shame.
Hardly had he made an end of his verses and come to a conclusion, when the Eunuch (who had heard him from his hiding place at his head) came up to him; whereupon the Fireman flea end stood afar off to see what passed between them. Then said the Eunuch to Zau al-Makan, ""Peace be with thee, O my lord!"" ""And on thee be peace,"" replied Zau al-Makan, ""and the mercy of Allah and His blessings!"" ""O my lord,"" continued the Eunuch—-And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say,
When it was the Seventy-fourth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Eunuch said to Zau al-Makan, ""O my lord, I have sought thee these several times this night, for my mistress biddeth thee to her."" Quoth Zau al- Makan, ""And who be this bitch that seeketh for me? Allah curse her and curse her husband with her!"" And he began to revile the Eunuch, who could make him no answer, because his mistress had charged him to do Zau al-Makan no hurt, nor bring him save of his own especial free will; and, if he would not accompany him, to give him the thousand diners. So the Castrato began to speak him fair and say to him, ""O my lord, take this purse and go with me. We will do thee no upright, O my son, nor wrong thee in aught; but our object is that thou bend thy gracious steps with me to my mistress, to receive her answer and return in weal and safety: and thou shalt have a handsome present as one who bringeth good news."" When Zau al- Makan heard this, he arose and went with the Eunuch and walked among the sleeping folk, stepping over them; whilst the Fireman followed after them from afar, and kept his eye upon him and said to himself, ""Alas the pity of his youth! Tomorrow they will hang him."" And he ceased not following them till he approached their station, without any observing him. Then he stood still and said, ""How base it will be of him, if he say it was I who bade him recite the verses!"" This was the case of the Stoker; but as regards what befel Zau al-Makan, he ceased not walking with the Eunuch till he reached his station and the Castrato went in to Nuzhat al-Zaman and said, ""O my lady, I have brought thee him whom thou soughtest, and he is a youth, fair of face and bearing the marks of wealth and gentle breeding."" When she heard this, her heart fluttered and she cried, ""Let him recite some verses, that I may hear him near hand, and after ask him his name and his condition and his native land."" Then the Eunuch went out to Zau al-Makan and said to him, ""Recite what verses thou knowest, for my lady is here hard by, listening to thee, and after I will ask thee of thy name and thy native country and thy condition."" Replied he, ""With love and gladness but, an thou ask my name, it is erased and my trace is unplaced and my body a waste. I have a story, the beginning of which is not known nor can the end of it be shown, and behold, I am even as one who hath exceeded in wine drinking and who hath not spared himself; one who is afflicted with distempers and who wandereth from his right mind, being perplexed about his case and drowned in the sea of thought."" When Nuzhat al-Zaman heard this, she broke out into excessive weeping and sobbing, and said to the Eunuch, ""Ask him if he have parted from one he loveth even as his mother or father."" The Castrato asked as she bade him, and Zau al-Makan replied, ""Yes, I have parted from every one I loved: but the dearest of all to me was my sister, from whom Fate hath separated me."" When Nuzhat al- Zaman heard this, she exclaimed, ""Allah Almighty reunite him with what he loveth!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seventy-fifth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Nuzhat al-Zaman heard his words she said, ""Allah reunite him with what he loveth!"" Then quoth she to the Eunuch, ""Tell him to let me hear somewhat anent his separation from his countrymen and his country."" The Eunuch did so, and Zau al-Makan sighed heavily and began repeating these couplets,
""Is not her love a pledge by all mankind confest? * The house
            that hometh Hinda be forever blest'
Her love all levels; man can reck of naught beside; * Naught or
           before or after can for man have zest
'Tis though the vale is paved with musk and ambergris * That day
           when Hinda's footstep on its face is prest:
Hail to the beauty of our camp, the pride of folk, * The dearling
           who en' Slaves all hearts by her behest:
Allah on 'Time's Delight' send large dropped clouds that teem *
           With genial rain but bear no thunder in their breast.""
And also these,
""I vow to Allah if at home I sight * My sister Nuzhat al-Zamani
           highs
I'll pass the days in joyance and delight * Mid bashful minions,
             maidens soft and white:
To sound of harps in various modes they smite * Draining the
            bowl, while eyes rain lively light
'Neath half closed lids, a sipping lips red bright * By stream
            bank flowing through my garden site.""
When he had finished his verse, Nuzhat al-Zaman lifted up a skirt of the litter curtain and looked at him. As soon as her eyes fell on his face, she knew him for certain and cried out, ""O my brother! O Zau al-Makan!"" He also looked at her and knew her and cried out, ""O my sister! O Nuzhat al-Zaman!"" Then she threw herself upon him and he gathered her to his bosom and the twain fell down in a fainting fit. When the Eunuch saw this case, he wondered at them and throwing over them somewhat to cover them, waited till they should recover. After a while they came to themselves, and Nuzhat al-Zaman rejoiced with exceeding joy: oppression and depression left her and gladness took the mastery of her, and she repeated these verses,
""Time sware my life should fare in woeful waste; * Forsworn art
           Time, expiate thy sin in haste!
Comes weal and comes a welcome friend to aid; * To him who brings
           good news, rise, gird thy waist
I spurned old world tales of Eden bliss; * Till came I
            Kausar on those lips
When Zau al-Makan heard this, he pressed his sister to his breast; tears streamed from his eyes for excess of joy and he repeated these couplets,
""Long I lamented that we fell apart, * While tears repentant
            railed from these eyne;
And sware, if Time unite us twain once more, * 'Severance' shall
            never sound from tongue of mine:
Joy hath so overwhelmed me that excess * Of pleasure from mine
            eyes draws gouts of brine:
Tears, O mine eyes, have now become your wont * Ye weep for
            pleasure and you weep for pine!""
They sat awhile at the litter door till she said to him, ""Come with me into the litter and tell me all that hath befallen thee, and I will tell thee what happened to me."" So they entered and Zau al-Maken said, ""Do thou begin thy tale."" Accordingly she told him all that had come to her since their separation at the Khan and what had happened to her with the Badawi; how the merchant had bought her of him and had taken her to her brother Sharrkan and had sold her to him; how he had freed her at the time of buying; how he had made a marriage contract with her and had gone in to her and how the King, their sire, had sent and asked for her from Sharrkan. Then quoth she, ""Praised be Allah who hath vouchsafed thee to me and ordained that, even as we left our father together, so together shall we return to him!"" And she added, ""Of a truth my brother Sharrkan gave me in marriage to this Chamberlain that he might carry me to my father. And this is what befel me from first to last; so now tell me how it hath fared with thee since I left thee."" Thereupon he told her all that had happened to him from beginning to end; and how Allah vouchsafed to send the Fireman to him, and how he had journeyed with him and spent his money on him and had served him night and day. She praised the Stoker for this and Zau al-Makan added, ""Of a truth, O my sister, this Fireman hath dealt with me in such benevolent wise as would not lover with lass nor sire with son, for that he fasted and gave me to eat, and he walked whilst he made me ride; and I owe my life to him."" Said she, ""Allah willing, we will requite him for all this, according to our power."" Then she called the Eunuch, who came and kissed Zau al- Makan's hand, and she said, ""Take thy reward for glad tidings, O face of good omen! It was thy hand reunited me with my brother; so the purse I gave thee and all in it are thine. But now go to thy master and bring him quickly to me."" The Castrato rejoiced and, going in to the Chamberlain, him to his mistress. Accordingly, he came in to his wife and finding Zau al-Makan with her, asked who he was. So she told him all that had befallen them both, first and last, and added, ""Know, O Chamberlain, that thou hast married no slave girl; far from it, thou hast taken to wife the daughter of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman for I am Nuzhat al- Zaman, and this is my brother, Zau al-Makan."" When the Chamberlain heard the story he knew it to be sooth, and its manifest truth appeared to him and he was certified that he was become King Omar bin al-Nu'uman's son in law, so he said to himself, "" 'Twill be my fate to be made viceroy of some province."" Then he went up to Zau al-Makan and gave him joy of his safety and reunion with his sister, and bade his servants forthwith make him ready a tent and one of the best of his own horses to ride. Thereupon said Nuzhat al-Zaman, ""We are now near our country and I would be left alone with my brother, that we may enjoy each other's company and take our fill of it ere we reach Baghdad; for we have been parted a long, long time."" ""Be it as thou biddest,"" replied the Chamberlain, and, going forth from them, sent them wax candles and various kinds of sweetmeats, together with three suits of the costliest for Zau al-Makan. Then he returned to the litter and related the good he had done and Nuzhat al-Zaman said to him, ""Bid the Eunuch bring me the Fireman and give him a horse to ride and ration him with a tray of food morning and evening, and let him be forbidden to leave us."" The Chamberlain called the Castrato and charged him to do accordingly; so he replied, ""I hear and I obey;"" and he took his pages with him and went out in search of the Stoker till he found him in the rear of the caravan, girthing his ass and preparing for flight. The tears were running adown his cheeks, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al-Makan; and he was saying to himself, ""Indeed, I warned him for the love of Allah, but he would not listen to me; Oh would I knew what is become of him!"" Ere he had done speaking the Eunuch was standing by his head whilst the pages surrounded him The Fireman turned and seeing the Eunuch and the pages gathered around him became yellow with fear,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Seventy-sixth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Stoker girthed his ass for flight and bespake himself, saying, ""Oh would I knew what is become of him!""; ere he had done speaking the Castrato was standing by his head and his side muscles quivered for fear and he lifted up his voice and cried, ""Verily he knoweth not the value of the good offices I have done him! I believe he hath denounced me to the Eunuch (hence these pages et about me) and he hath made me an accomplice in his crime."" Then the effeminated one cried at him, saying, ""Who was it recited the verses? O liar! why didst thou say, 'I never repeated these couplets, nor do I know who repeated them;' when it was thy companion? But now I will not leave thee between this place and Baghdad, and what betideth thy comrade shall betide thee."" Quoth the Fireman, ""What I feared hath befallen me."" And he repeated this couplet,
""'Twas as I feared the coming ills discerning: * But unto Allah we are all returning.""
Then the Eunuch cried upon the pages, saying, ""Take him off the ass."" So they carried him along with the caravan, surrounded by the pages, as the white contains the black of the eye; and the Castrato said to them, ""If a hair of him be lost, you will be lost with it."" And he bade them privily treat him with honour and not humiliate him. But when the Stoker saw himself beset by the pages, he despaired of his life and turning to the Eunuch, said to him, ""O Chief, I am neither this youth's brother nor am I akin to him, nor is he sib to me; but I was a Fireman in a Hammam and found him cast out, in his sickness, on the dung heap."" Then the caravan fared on and the Stoker wept and imagined in himself a thousand things, whilst the Eunuch walked by his side and told him nothing, but said to him, ""Thou disturbedst our mistress by reciting verses, thou and this youth: but fear nothing for thy self;"" and kept laughing at him the while to himself. Whenever the caravan halted, they served him with food, and he and the Castrato ate from one dish. Then the Eunuch bade his lads bring a gugglet of sugared sherbet and, after drinking himself, gave it to the Fireman, who drank; but all the while his tears never dried, out of fear for his life and grief for his separation from Zau al-Makan and for what had befallen them in their strangerhood. So they both travelled on with the caravan, whilst the Chamberlain now rode by the door of his wife's litter, in attendance on Zau al-Makan and his sister, and now gave an eye to the Fireman; and Nuzhat al-Zaman and her brother occupied themselves with converse and mutual condolence; and they ceased not after this fashion till they came within three days' journey from Baghdad. Here they alighted at eventide and rested till the morning morrowed; and as they awoke and they were about to load the beasts, behold, there appeared afar off a great cloud of dust that darkened the firmament till it became black as gloomiest night. Thereupon the Chamberlain cried out to them, ""Stay, and your loading delay!""; then, mounting with his Mamelukes, rode forward in the direction of the dust cloud. When they drew near, suddenly appeared under it a numerous conquering host like the full tide sea, with flags and standards, drums and kettledrums, horsemen and footmen. The Chamberlain marvelled at this; and when the troops saw him, there detached itself from amongst them a plump of five hundred cavaliers, who fell upon him and his suite and surrounded them, five for one; whereupon said he to them, ""What is the matter and what are these troops, that ye do this with us?"" Asked they, ""Who art thou; and whence comest thou, and whither art thou bound?"" and he answered, ""I am the Chamberlain of the Emir of Damascus, King Sharrkan, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman, Lord of Baghdad and of the land of Khorasan, and I bring tribute and presents from him to his father in Baghdad."" When the horsemen heard his words they let their head kerchiefs fall over their faces and wept, saying, ""In very sooth King Omar is dead and he died not but of poison. So fare ye forwards; no harm shall befal you till you join his Grand Wazir, Dandan."" Now when the Chamberlain heard this, he wept sore and exclaimed, ""Oh for our disappointment in this our journey!"" Then he and all his suite wept till they had come up with the host and sought access to the Wazir Dandan, who granted an interview and called a halt and, causing his pavilion to be pitched, sat down on a couch therein and commanded to admit the Chamberlain. Then he bade him be seated and questioned him; and he replied that he was Chamberlain to the Emir of Damascus and was bound to King Omar with presents and the tribute of Syria. The Wazir, hearing the mention of King Omar's name, wept and said, ""King Omar is dead by poison, and upon his dying the folk fell out amongst themselves as to who should succeed him, until they were like to slay one another on this account; but the notables and grandees and the four Kazis interposed and all the people agreed to refer the matter to the decision of the four judges and that none should gainsay them. So it was agreed that we go to Damascus and fetch thence the King's son, Sharrkan, and make him Sultan over his father's realm. And amongst them were some who would have chosen the cadet, Zau Al-Makan, for, quoth they, his name be Light of the Place, and he hath a sister Nuzhat al-Zaman highs, the Delight of the Time; but they set out five years ago for Al-Hijaz and none wotteth what is become of them."" When the Chamberlain heard this, he knew; that his wife had told him the truth of her adventures; and he grieved with sore grief for the death of King Omar, albeit he joyed with exceeding joy, especially at the arrival of Zau al-Makan, for that he would now become Sultan of Baghdad in his father's stead—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seventy-seventh Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan's Chamberlain heard of the death of King Omar bin al- Nu'uman he mourned, but he rejoiced because of his wife and her brother Zau al-Makan who would become Sultan of Baghdad in his father's stead. So he turned to the Wazir Dandan and said to him, ""Verily your tale is a wonder of wonders! Know, O Chief Wazir, that here, where you have encountered me, Allah hath given you rest from fatigue and bringeth you your desire after the easiest of fashions, for that His Almighty Will restoreth to you Zau al-Makan and his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman; whereby we will settle the matter as we easily can."" When the Minister heard these words he rejoiced with great joy and said, ""O Chamberlain, tell me the tale of the twain and what befel them and the cause of their long absence."" So he repeated to him the whole story and told him that Nuzhat al-Zaman was his wife and related to him the adventures of Zau al-Makan from first to last. As soon as he had ended his tale, the Wazir sent for the Emirs and Wazirs and Chief Officers and acquainted them with the matter; whereat they rejoiced with great joy and wondered at the happy chance. Then they gathered in a body and went in to the Chamberlain and did their service to him, kissing the ground between his hands; and the Wazir Dandan also rose and went out to meet him and stood before him in honour. After this, the Chamberlain held on that day a Divan council; and he and the Wazir sat upon a throne, whilst all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State took their places before them, according to their several ranks. Then they melted sugar in rose water and drank, after which the Emirs sat down to hold council and permitted the rest of the host to mount and ride forward leisurely, till they should make an end of their debate and overtake them. So the officers kissed the ground between their hands and mounting, rode onwards, preceded by the standards of war. When the grandees had finished their conference, they took horse and rejoined the host; and the Chamberlain approached the Wazir Dandan and said, ""I deem it well to ride on before you, and precede you, that I may get ready a place for the Sultan and notify him of your coming and of your choosing him as Sultan over the head of his brother Sharrkan."" ""Aright thou reckest,"" answered the Wazir Then the Chamberlain rose up in haste and Dandan also stood up to do him honour and brought him presents, which he conjured him to accept. In similar guise did all the Emirs and Grandees and Officers of State, bringing him gifts and calling down blessings on him and saying to him, ""Haply thou wilt mention our case to Sultan Zau al-Makan and speak to him to continue us in our dignities."" The Chamberlain promised all they required and bade his pages be ready to march, whereupon the Wazir Dandan sent with him tents and bade the tent pitchers set them up at a day's journey from the city. And they did his bidding. Then the Chamberlain mounted and rode forward, full of joy and saying to himself, ""How blessed is this gurney!"", and indeed his wife was exalted in his eyes, she and her brother Zau al-Makan. They made all haste over their wayfare, till they reached a place distant a day's journey from Baghdad, where the Chamberlain called a halt for rest, and bade his men alight and make ready a sitting place for the Sultan Zau al-Makan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, while he rode forward with his Mamelukes and, alighting at a distance from Nuzhat al-Zaman's litter, commanded the eunuchs to ask leave of admission to the presence. They did so and she gave permission; whereupon he went in to her and conversed with her and her brother; and told them of the death of their father; and of Zau al-Makan, how the heads of the people had made him King over them in the stead of his sire; and he gave them joy of the kingdom. They both wept for their father and asked the manner of his being killed; but the Chamberlain answered, ""The news rests with the Wazir Dandan who will be here tomorrow leading all the host; and it only remaineth for thee, O King, to do what they counsel, since they have unanimously chosen thee Sultan; for if thou do not this, they will choose some one else and thou canst not be sure of thy life with another Sultan. Haply he will kill thee, or discord may befal between you twain and the kingdom pass out of the hands of both."" Zau al-Makan bowed his head awhile and then said, ""I accept this position;"" for indeed there was no refusing; and he was certified that the Chamberlain had counselled him well and wisely and set him on the right way. Then he added, ""O my uncle, how shall I do with my brother Sharrkan?"" ""O my son,"" replied the Chamberlain, ""thy brother will be Sultan of Damascus and thou Sultan of Baghdad; so take heart of grace and get ready thy case."" Zau al-Makan accepted this and the Chamberlain presented him with a suit of royal raiment and a dagger of state, which the Wazir Dandan had brought with him; then leaving him he bade the tent pitchers choose a spot of rising ground and set up thereon a spacious pavilion, wherein the Sultan might sit to receive the Emirs and Grandees. Moreover he ordered the kitcheners to cook rich viands and serve them and he commanded the water carriers to dispose the water troughs. They did as he bade them and presently arose a cloud of dust from the ground and spread till it walled the horizon round. After awhile, the dust dispersed and there appeared under it the army of Baghdad and Khorasan, a conquering host like the full tide sea.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Seventy-eighth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Chamberlain bade the tent pitchers set up a pavilion spacious enough to receive the subjects flocking to their Sultan, they planted a splendid Sháhmiyánah befitting Kings. And as they ended their labours behold, a dust cloud spired aloft and the breeze made it lift and beneath it showed a conquering host; and presently it appeared that this was the army of Baghdad and Khorasan preceded by the Wazir Dandan. And in it all rejoiced at the accession of the ""Light of the Place."" Now Zau al-Makan had donned robes of royal estate and girt himself with the sword of state: so the Chamberlain brought him a steed and he mounted surrounded by the Mamelukes and all the company from the tents on foot, to do him service, and he rode on until he came to the great pavilion, where he sat down and he laid the royal dagger across his thighs, whilst the Chamberlain stood in attendance on him and his armed slaves stationed themselves under the entrance awning of the Shahmiyanah, with drawn swords in their hands. Presently, up came the troops and the host and craved admission so the Chamberlain went in to Zau al-Makan and asked his leave whereupon he bade admit them, ten by ten. The Chamberlain acquainted them with the King's commands, to which they replied, ""We hear and we obey;"" and all drew up before the pavilion entrance. Then he took ten of them and carried them through the vestibule into the presence of Sultan Zau al-Makan, whom when they saw, they were awed; but he received them with most gracious kindness and promised them all good. So they gave him joy of his safe return and invoked Allah's blessings upon him after which they took the oath of fealty never to gainsay him in aught and they kissed ground before him and withdrew. Then other ten entered and he entreated them as he had entreated the ethers; and they ceased not to enter, ten by ten, till none was left but the Wazir Dandan. Lastly the Minister went in and kissed the ground before Zau al-Makan, who rose to meet him, saying, ""Welcome, O Wazir and sire sans peer! Verily, thine acts are those of a counsellor right dear, and judgement and foreseeing clear are in the hands of the Subtle of Lere."" Then bade he the Chamberlain forthwith go out and cause the tables to be spread and order all the troops thereto. So they came and ate and drank. Moreover the Sultan commanded his Wazir Dandan call a ten days' halt of the army, that he might be private with him and learn from him how and wherefore his father had been slain. The Wazir obeyed the commands of the Sultan with submission and wished him eternity of glory and said, ""This needs must be!"" He then repaired to the heart of the encampment and ordered the host to halt ten days. They did as he bade them and, moreover, he gave them leave to divert themselves and ordered that none of the lords in waiting should attend upon the King for service during the space of three days. Then the Wazir went to the Sultan and reported all to him, and Zau al-Makan waited until nightfall, when he went in to his sister Nuzhat al-Zaman and asked her, ""Dost thou know the cause of my father's murder or not?"" ""I have no knowledge of the cause,"" she answered, and drew a silken curtain before herself, whilst Zau al-Makan seated himself without the curtain and commanded the Wazir to the presence and, when he came, said to him, ""I desire thou relate to me in detail the cause of the killing of my sire, King Omar bin al-Nu'uman!"" ""Know then, O King,"" replied Dandan, ""that King Omar bin al- Nu'uman, when he returned to Baghdad from his chasing and hunting and entered the city, enquired for thee and thy sister, but could not find you and knew that you twain had gone on the Pilgrimage; whereat he was greatly grieved and much angered, and his breast was straitened and he abode thus half a year, seeking news of you from all who came and went but none could give him any tidings. Now while we were in attendance upon him one day, after a whole year had sped since ye were lost to his sight, lo! there came to us an ancient dame with signs of being a devotee, accompanied by five damsels, high bosomed virgins like moons, endowed with such beauty and loveliness as tongue faileth to describe; and, to crown their perfections of comeliness, they could read the Koran and were versed in various kinds of learning and in the histories of bygone peoples. Then that old woman sought audience of the King, and he bade admit her; whereupon she entered the presence and kissed the ground between his hands. I was then sitting by his side and he, seeing in her the signs of asceticism and devoutness, made her draw near and take seat hard by him. And when she had sat down she addressed him and said, 'Know, O King, that with me are five damsels, whose like no King among the Kings possesseth; for they are endowed with wit and beauty and loveliness and perfection. They read the Koran—and the Traditions and are skilled in all manner of learning and in the history of bygone races. They stand here between thy hands to do thee service, O King of the Age, and it is by trial that folk are prized or despised. 'Thy father, who hath found mercy; looked at the damsels and their favour pleased him; so he said to them, Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!'—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Seventy-ninth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said unto King Zau al-Makan, ""Thy father, who hath found mercy, glanced at the damsels and their favour pleased him and he said to them, 'Let each and every of you make me hear something of what she knoweth anent the history of the folk of yore and of peoples long gone before!' Thereupon one of them came forward and, kissing the ground before him, spake as follows 'Know, O King, that it behoveth one of good breeding to eschew impertinence and adorn himself with excellencies, and observe the Divine injunctions and avoid mortal sins; and to this he should apply himself with the assiduity of one who, if he stray therefrom, falleth into perdition; for the foundation of good breeding is virtuous behaviour. And know that the chief cause and reason of man's existence is the endeavour after life everlasting, and the right way thereto is the service of Allah. Wherefore it behoveth thee to deal beneficently with the people: and swerve not from this canon, for the mightier men are in dignity, the more their need of prudence and foresight; and indeed Monarchs need this more than the many, for the general cast themselves into affairs, without taking thought to the issue thereof. Be thou prodigal of thy life and thy good in the way of Allah, and know that, if an enemy dispute with thee, thou mayst dispute with him and refute him with proofs and be proof against him; but as for thy friend, there is none can judge between thee and him save righteousness and fair dealing. Choose, therefore, thy friend for thyself, after thou hast proved him. If he be of the brotherhood of futurity, let him be zealous in observing the externals of the Holy Law and versed in its inner meaning, as far as may be; and if he be of the brotherhood of the world, let him be free born, sincere, neither a fool nor a perverse, for the fool man is such that even his parents might well flee from him, and a liar cannot be a true friend. Indeed the word, Siddík ('friend') deriveth from Sidk ('truth') that welleth up from the bottom of the heart; and how can this be the case, when falsehood is manifest upon the tongue? And know, that the observance of the Law profiteth him who practiseth it: so love thy brother, if he be of this quality and do not cast him off, even if thou see in him that which irketh thee, for a friend is not I like a wife, whom one can divorce and re-marry: nay, his heart is like glass: once broken, it may not be mended. And Allah bless him who saith,
'Ware how thou hurtest man with hurt of heart; * 'Tis hard to win
             thee back the heart offended:
For hearts indeed, whence love is alien made, * Like broken glass
             may nevermore be mended.'
The maiden continued and concluded with pointing out to us what sages say, 'The best of brethren is he who is the most constant in good counsel; the best of action is that which is fairest in its consequence, and the best of praise is not that which is in the mouths of men. It is also said, 'It behoveth not the servant to neglect thanking Allah especially for two favours, health and reason.' Again it is said, 'Whoso honoureth himself, his lust is a light matter to him, and he who maketh much of his small troubles, Allah afflicteth him with the greater; he who obeyeth his own inclination neglecteth his duties and he who listeneth to the slanderer loseth the true friend. He who thinketh well of thee, do thou fulfill his thought of thee. He who exceedeth in contention sinneth, and he who against upright standeth not on ward, is not safe from the sword. Now will I tell thee somewhat of the duties of Kazis and judges. Know, O King, that no judgement serveth the cause of justice save it be given after proof positive, and it behoveth the judge to treat all people on the same level, to the intent that the great may not hunger for oppression nor the small despair of justice. Furthermore he should extract proof from the complainant and impose an oath upon the defendant; and mediation is admissible between Moslems, except it be a compromise sanctioning the unlawful or forbidding the lawful. If thou shalt have done aught during the day, of which thy reason is doubtful but thy good intention is proved, thou (O Kazi) shouldst revert to the right, for to do justice is a religious obligation and to return to that which is right is better than persistence in wrong. Then (O judge) thou shouldest study precedents and the law of the case and do equal justice between the suitors, withal fixing thine eyes upon the truth and committing thine affair to Allah (be He extolled and exalted!). And require thou proof of the complainant, and if he adduce evidence let him have due benefit of it; and if not, put the defendant to his oath; for this is the ordinance of Allah. Receive thou the testimony of competent Moslem witnesses, one against other, for Almighty Allah hath commanded judges to judge by externals, He Himself taking charge of the inner and secret things. It behoveth the judge also to avoid giving judge meet, whilst suffering from stress of pain or hunger, and that in his decisions between folk he seek the face of Allah Almighty for he whose intent is pure and who is at peace with himself, Allah shall guarantee him against what is between him and the people.' Quoth al-Zuhri, 'There are three things for which, if they be found in a Kazi, he should be deposed; namely, if he honour the base, if he love praise and if he fear dismissal. And Omar bin Abd al-Aziz once deposed a Kazi, who asked him, 'Why hast thou dismissed me? It hath reached me,' answered Omar, 'that thy converse is greater than thy condition.' It is said also that Iskandar said to his Kazi, 'I have invested thee with this function and committed to thee in it my soul and mine honour and my manliness; so do thou guard it with thy sense and thine understanding.' To his Cook he said, 'Thou art the Sultan of my body; so look thou tender it as thine own self.' To his Secretary he said, 'Thou art the controller of my wit: so do thou watch over me in what thou writest for me and from me.'"" Thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eightieth Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, ""Thereupon the first damsel backed out from the presence and a second damsel came forward and, kissing the ground seven times before the King thy father, spake as follows, 'The sage Lukmán said to his son, 'There be three who are known only in three several cases; the merciful man is unknown save in time of wrath, the brave only in battle, and thy friend in time of need.' It is said that the oppressor shall be depress though by people praised, and that the oppress is at rest though by people blamed. Quoth Allah Almighty, 'Assuredly deem not that those who rejoice in what they have done, and who love to be praised for what they have not done, shall escape reckoning of punishment: indeed there is reserved for them a grievous penalty.' And he said (on whom be salvation and salutation!), 'Works are according to intention and to each man is attributed that which he intendeth.' He said also, 'In the body is a part which being sound the rest is sound, and which being unsound the whole is unsound.' And this is the heart. Now this heart is the most marvellous of what is in man, since it is that which ordereth his whole affair: If covetise stir in it, desire destroyeth him, and if affliction master it, anguish slayeth him; if anger rage in it, danger is hard upon him; if it be blest with contentment, he is safe from discontent; if fear surprise it, he is full of mourning; and if calamity overtake it, affliction betideth him. If a man gain the use of wealth, peradventure he is diverted thereby from the remembrance of his Lord; if poverty choke him his heart is distracted by woe, or if disquietude waste his heart, weakness causeth him to fall. Thus, in any case, nothing profiteth him but that he be mindful of Allah and occupy himself with gaining his livelihood in this world and securing his place in the next. It was asked of a certain sage, 'Who is the most ill conditioned of men?'; and he answered, 'The man whose lusts master his manhood and whose mind soareth over high, so that his knowledge dispreadeth and his excuse diminisheth; and how excellently saith the poet,
Freest am I of all mankind fro' meddling wight * Who, seeing
            others err, self error ne'er can sight:
Riches and talents are but loans to creature lent, * Each wears
            the cloak of that he bears in breast and sprite:
If by mistaken door attempt on aught thou make, * Thou shalt go
            wrong and if the door be right, go right!'
Continued the maiden, 'As for anecdotes of devotees, quoth Hisham bin Bashar, 'I asked Omar bin Ubayd, What is true piety?'; and he answered, 'The Apostle of Allah (to whom be salutation and salvation!) hath explained it when he sayeth, The pious is he who forgetteth not the grave nor calamity and who preferreth that which endureth to that which passeth away; who counteth not the morrow as of his days but reckoneth himself among the dead.' And it is related that Abu Zarr used to say, Want is dearer to me than wealth, and unheal is dearer to me than health.' Quoth one of the listeners, 'May Allah have mercy on Abu Zarr!'. For my part, I say, 'Whoso putteth his trust in the goodness of the election of Almighty Allah should be content with that condition which Allah hath chosen for him.' Quoth one of the Companions of the Prophet, 'Ibn Abi Aufa once prayed with us the dawn prayer. When he had done, he recited, 'O Thou Enwrapped!' till he came to where Allah saith, 'When there shall be a trumping on the trumpet,' and fell down dead. It is said that Sabit al-Banani wept till he well nigh lost his eyes. They brought him a man to medicine him who said to him, 'I will cure thee, provided thou obey my bidding' Asked Sabit, 'In what matter?' Quoth the leach, 'In that thou leave weeping!' 'What is the worth of mine eyes?', rejoined Sabit, 'if they do not weep?' Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, 'Exhort thou me!'""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eighty-first Night,
She continued, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan said to Zau al-Makan, ""Thus spake the second hand maid to the King who hath found mercy, Omar bin al-Nu'uman. 'Quoth a man to Mohammed bin Abdillah, Exhort thou me!' 'I exhort thee,' replied he, 'to be a self ruler, an abstainer in this world, and in the next a greedy slave.' 'How so?' asked the other and Mohammed answered, 'The abstinent man in this world conquereth both the world that is and the world to come.' And quoth Ghaus bin Abdillah, 'There were two brothers among the sons of Israel, one of whom said to the other, 'What be the most perilous thing thou hast done?' Replied the brother, 'I once came upon a nest of young birds; so I took out one and threw it back into the nest; but among the chickens were some which drew apart from it. This is the most perilous thing I ever did; now what be the most perilous thing thou hast ever done?' He rejoined, 'When I arise for prayer I am fearful that it is only for the sake of the reward.' Now their father heard these words and exclaimed, 'O Allah, an say they sooth take them to Thyself!' It was declared by one of the wise men, 'Verily, these were of the most virtuous of children.' Quoth Sa'íd bin Jubayr, 'I was once in company with Fuzalah bin 'Ubaydand said to him, 'Exhort thou me!, Replied he, 'Bear in mind these two necessaries, Shun syntheism and harm not any of Allah's creatures.' And he repeated these two couplets,
'Be as thou wilt, for Allah still is bounteous Lord, * And care
            dispeller dread not therefore bane and ban
To two things only never draw thee nigh, nor give * Partner to
            Allah trouble to thy brother man.'
And how well saith the poet,
'An thou of pious works a store neglect * And after death meet
             one who did collect,
Thou shalt repent thou diddest not as he, * Nor madest ready as
             he did elect.'
Then the third damsel came forward, after the second had with drawn, and said, 'Of a truth, the chapter of piety is exceeding wide; but I will mention what occurreth to me thereof, concerning the pious of old. Quoth a certain holy man, 'I congratulate myself in death, though I am not assured of rest therein, save that I know death interveneth between a man and his works; so I hope for the doubling of good works and the docking off of ill works.' And Ita'a al Salami, when he had made an end of an exhortation, was wont to tremble and grieve and weep sore; and as they asked him why he did this he answered, 'I desire to enter upon a grave matter, and it is the standing up before Almighty Allah to do in accordance with my exhortation.' In similar guise Zayn al-Abidín, son of Al-Husayn, was wont to tremble when he rose to pray. Being asked the cause of this, he replied, 'Know ye not before whom I stand and whom I address?' It is said that there lived near Sufyán al-Thauri a blind man who, when the month of Ramazan came, went out with the folk to pray, but remained silent and hung back. Said Sufyan, 'On the Day of Resurrection he shall come with the people of the Koran and they will be distinguished by increase of honour from their fellows.' Quoth Sufyan, 'Were the soul established in the heart as befitteth, it would fly away for joy and pining for Paradise, and for grief and fear of hell-fire.' It is related also of Sufyan Al-Thauri that he said, 'To look upon the face of a tyrant is a sin.' Then the third damsel retired and came for ward the fourth, who said, 'Here am I to treat of sundry traditions of pious men which suggest themselves to me. It is related that Bishr Barefoot said, 'I once heard Khálid say, 'Beware of secret polytheism.' I asked, 'What may secret polytheism be?'; and he answered, 'When one of you in praying prolong his inclinations and prostrations till a cause of impurity come upon him.' And one of the sages said, 'Doing works of weal expiateth what is ill.' Quoth Ibrahim, 'I supplicated Bishr Barefoot to acquaint me with some theological mysteries; but he said, 'O my son, this knowledge it behoveth us not to teach to every one; of every hundred five, even as the legal alms upon money.' Said Ibrahim, 'I thought his reply excellent and approved of it and while I was praying behold, Bishr was also praying: so I stood behind him making the prayer bow till the Mu'ezzin called his call. Then rose a man of tattered appearance and said, O folk, beware of a truth which bringeth unweal, for there is no harm in a lie bringing weal, and in time of need no choice we heed: speech booteth not in the absence of good qualities even as silence hurteth not in the presence of good. Presently I saw Bishr drop a danik, so I picked it up and exchanged it for a dirham which I gave him. Quoth he, 'I will not take it.' Quoth I, 'It is perfectly lawful change'; but he rejoined 'I cannot take in exchange the riches of the present world for those of the future world.' It is related also that Bishr Barefoot's sister once went to Ahmad bin Hanbal""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eighty-second Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to bespeak Zau al-Makan on this wise, ""And quoth the maiden to thy father, 'Bishr Barefoot's sister once went to Ahmad bin Hanbal and said to him, 'O Imam of the Faith, we are a family that spin thread by night and work for our living by day; and oftentimes the cressets of the watch of Baghdad pass by and we on the roof spinning by their light. Is this forbidden to us?' Asked Ahmad:'Who are thou?' 'I am the sister of Bishr Barefoot,' answered she. Rejoined the Iman, 'O household of Bishr, I shall never cease to drink full draughts of piety from your hearts.' Quoth one of the sages, 'When Allah willeth well to His servant He openeth upon him the gate of action.' Málik bin Dinár, when he passed through the bazar and saw aught he desired, was wont to say, 'O soul, take patience, for I will not accord to thee what thou desirest.' He said also (Allah accept him!), 'The salvation of the soul lies in resistance to it and its damnation in submission to it.' Quoth Mansúr bin Ammár, 'I made a pilgrimage and was faring Meccahwards by way of Cufa, and the night was overcast, when I heard a voice crying out from the deeps of the darkness saying, 'O Allah, I swear by Thy Greatness and Thy Glory, I meant not through my disobedience to transgress against Thee; for indeed I am not ignorant of Thee; but my fault is one Thou didst foreordain to me from eternity without beginning; so do Thou pardon my transgression, for indeed I disobeyed Thee of my ignorance!' When he had made an end of his prayer he recited aloud the verse, 'O true believers, save your souls and those of your families from the fire whose fuel is men and stones.' Then I heard a fall, but not knowing what it was I passed on. When the morning morrowed, as we went our way, behold, we fell in with a funeral train, followed by an old woman whose strength had left her. I asked her of the dead, and she answered, 'This is the funeral of a man who passed by us yesterday whilst my son was standing at prayer and after his prayers he recited a verse from the Book of Allah Almighty when the man's gall bladder burst and he fell dead.' Therewith the fourth damsel retired and the fifth came forward and said, 'I here will also repeat what occurreth to me regarding the acts of devotees in olden time. Maslamah bin Dinár used to say, 'By making sound the secret thoughts, sins great and small are covered'; and, 'when the servant of Allah is resolved to leave sinning, victory cometh to him.' Also quoth he, 'Every worldly good which doth not draw one nearer to Allah is a calamity, for a little of this world distracteth from a mickle of the world to come and a mickle of the present maketh thee forget the whole of the future.' It was asked of Abú Házim, 'Who is the most prosperous of men?'; and he answered, 'Whoso spendeth his life in submission to Allah.' The other enquired, 'And who is the most foolish of mankind?' 'Whoso selleth his future for the worldly goods of others,' replied Abu Hazim. It is reported of Moses (on whom be peace!) that when he came to the waters of Midian he exclaimed, 'O Lord, verily I stand in need of the good which thou shalt send down to me.' And he asked of his Lord and not of his folk. There came two damsels and he drew water for them both and allowed not the shepherds to draw first. When the twain returned, they informed their father Shu'ayb (on whom be peace!) who said, 'Haply, he is hungry,' adding to one of them, 'Go back to him and bid him hither.' Now when she came to Moses, she veiled her face and said, 'My father biddeth thee to him that he may pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for us.' Moses was averse to this and was not willing to follow her. Now she was a woman large in the back parts, and the wind blowing upon her garment covered the hinder cheeks to Moses; which when Moses saw, he lowered his eyes and said to her, 'Get thee behind while I walk in front.' So she followed him till he entered the house of Shu'ayb where supper was ready.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eighty-third Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, ""Now, quoth the fifth damsel to thy sire, 'When Moses (on whom be peace!) entered the home of Shu'ayb where supper was ready, Shu'ayb said to him, 'O Moses, I desire to pay thee thy wage for having drawn water for these two.' But Moses answered, 'I am of a household which selleth nothing of the fashion of the next world for what is on earth of gold and silver.' Then quoth Shu'ayb, 'O youth! nevertheless thou art my guest, and it is my wont and that of my forbears to honour the guest by setting food before him.' So Moses sat down and ate. Then Shu'ayb hired Moses for eight pilgrimages, that is to say, eight years, and made his wage marriage with one of his two daughters, and Moses' service to him was to stand for her dowry. As saith the Holy Writ of him, 'Verily I will give thee one of these my two daughters in marriage, on condition that thou serve me for hire eight pilgrimages: and if thou fulfil ten years, it is in thine own breast; for I seek not to impose a hardship on thee.' A certain man once said to one of his friends whom he had not met for many days, 'Thou hast made me desolate, for that I have not seen thee this long while.' Quoth the other, 'I have been distracted from thee by Ibn Shiháb: dost thou know him?' Quoth his friend, 'Yes, he hath been my neighbour these thirty years, but I have never spoken to him.' He replied, 'Verily thou forgettest Allah in forgetting—thy neighbour! If thou lovedst Allah thou wouldst love thy neighbour. Knowest thou not that a neighbour hath a claim upon his neighbour, even as the right of kith and kin?' Said Huzayfah, 'We entered Meccah with Ibráhím bin Adham, and Shakík al-Balkhí was also making a pilgrimage that year. Now we met whilst circumambulating the Ka'abah and Ibrahim said to Shakik, 'What is your fashion in your country?' Replied Shakik, 'When we are blest with our daily bread we eat, and when we hunger we take patience.' 'This wise,' said Ibrahim, 'do the dogs of Balkh; but we, when blest with plenty, do honour to Allah and when an hungered we thank Him.' And Shakik seated himself before Ibrahim and said to him, 'Thou art my master.' Also said Mohammed bin Imrán, 'A man once asked of Hátim the Deaf 'What maketh thee to trust in Allah?' 'Two things,' answered he, 'I know that none save myself shall eat my daily bread, so my heart is at rest as to that; and I know that I was not created without the knowledge of Allah, and am abashed before Him.' Then the fifth damsel retired and the ancient dame came forward and, kissing the ground before thy father nine times, said, 'Thou hast heard, O King, what these all have spoken on the subject of piety; and I will follow their example in relating what hath reached me of the famous men of past times. It is said that the Imam al-Sháfi'í departed the night into three portions, the first for study, the second for sleep and the third for prayer. The Imam Abú Hanífah was wont also to pass half the night in prayer. One
day a man pointed him out to another, as he walked by and remarked, 'Yonder man watcheth the whole night.' When he heard this Abu Hanifah said, 'I was abashed before Allah to hear myself praised for what was not in me'; so after this he used to watch the whole night. And one of the Sages hath said,
'Who seeketh for pearl in the Deep dives deep; * Who on high would hie robs his night of sleep.'
Al-Rabí a relates that Al-Shafi'i used to recite the whole Koran seventy times during the month of Ramazan, and that in his daily prayers. Quoth Al-Shafi'i (Allah accept him!), 'During ten years I never ate my fill of barley bread, for fullness hardeneth the heart and deadeneth the wit and induceth sleep and enfeebleth one from standing up to pray.' It is reported of Abdullah bin Mohammed al-Sakrá that he said, 'I was once talking with Omar and he observed to me, 'Never saw I a more God fearing or eloquent man than Mohammed bin Idris al-Shafi'i.' It so happened I went out one day with Al-Háris bin Labíb al-Saffár, who was a disciple of Al-Muzani and had a fine voice and he read the saying of the Almighty, 'This shall be a day whereon they shall not speak to any purpose, nor shall they be permitted to excuse themselves.' I saw Al-Shafi'i's colour change; his skin shuddered with horripilation, he was violently moved and he fell down in a fainting fit When he revived he said, 'I take refuge with Allah from the stead of the liars and the lot of the negligent! O Allah, before whom the hearts of the wise abase themselves, O Allah, of Thy bene ficence accord to me the remission of my sins, adorn me with the curtain of Thy protection and pardon me my shortcomings, by the magnanimity of Thy Being!' Then I rose and went away. Quoth one of the pious, 'When I entered Baghdad, Al-Shafi'i was there. So I sat down on the river bank to make the ablution before prayer; and behold, there passed me one who said, 'O youth, make thy Wuzu-ablution well and Allah will make it well for thee in this world and in the next.' I turned and lo! there was a man behind whom came a company of people. So I hastened to finish my ablution and followed him. Presently, he turned and asked me, 'Say, dost thou want aught?' 'Yes,' answered I, 'I desire that thou teach me somewhat of that which Allah Almighty hath taught thee.' He said, 'Know then that whoso believeth in Allah shall be saved, and whoso jealously loveth his faith shall be delivered from destruction, and whoso practiseth abstinence in this world, his eyes shall be solaced on the morrow of death. Shall I tell thee any more?' I replied, 'Assuredly;' and he continued, 'Be thou of the world that is, heedless; and of the world to come, greediest. Be truthful in all thy dealings, and thou shalt be saved with the Salvationists.' Then he went on and I asked about him and was told that he was the Imam Al-Shafi'i. Al-Shafi'i was wont to remark, 'I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine, on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eighty-fourth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, ""The old woman bespake thy sire, saying, 'The Imam Al-Shafi'i was wont to remark, I love to see folk profit by this learning of mine on condition that nothing of it be attributed to me.' He also said, 'I never disputed with any one, but I would that Almighty Allah should give him the knowledge of the Truth and aid him to dispread it: nor did I ever dispute with anyone at all but for the showing forth of the Truth, and I reck not whether Allah manifest it by my tongue or by His.' He said also (whom Allah accept!), 'If thou fear to grow conceited of thy lore, then bethink thee Whose grace thou seekest and for what good thou yearnest and what punishment thou dreadest.' It was told to Abu Hanífah that the Commander of the Faithful, Abú Ja'afar al-Mansúr, had appointed him Kazi and ordered him a salary of ten thousand dirhams; but he would not accept of this; and, when the day came on which the money was to be paid him, he prayed the dawn prayer, then covered his head with his robe—and spoke not. When the Caliph's messenger came with the money, he went in to the Imam and accosted him, but he would not speak to him. So the messenger said, 'Verily this money is lawfully thine.' 'I know that it is lawfully mine,' replied he: 'but I abhor that the love of tyrants get a hold upon my heart.' Asked the other, 'If thou go in to them canst thou not guard thyself from loving them?' Answered Abu Hanifah, 'Can I look to enter the sea without my clothes being wet?' Another of Al-Shafi'i's sayings (Allah accept him!) is,
'Oh soul of me, an thou accept my rede, * Thou shalt be wealthy
           and of grace entire:
Cast off ambitious hopes and vain desires, * How many a death was
            done by vain desire!'
Among the sayings of Sufyán al-Thaurí, with which he admonished Ali bin al-Hasan al-Salami was, 'Be thou a man of truth and 'ware lies and treachery and hypocrisy and pride. Be not indebted save to Him who is merciful to His debtors; and let thine associate be one who shall dissociate thee from the world. Be ever mindful of death and be constant in craving pardon of Allah and in beseeching of Allah peace for what remaineth of thy life. Counsel every True Believer, when he asketh thee concerning the things of his faith; and beware of betraying a Believer, for whoso betrayeth a Believer, betrayeth Allah and His Apostle. Avoid dissensions and litigation; and leave that which causeth doubt in thee for things which breed no doubt: so shalt thou be at peace. Enjoin beneficence and forbid malevolence: so shalt thou be loved of Allah. Adorn thine inner man and Allah shall adorn thine outer man. Accept the excuse of him who excuseth self to thee and hate not any one of the Moslems. Draw near unto those who withdraw from thee and excuse those that misuse thee: so shalt thou be the friend of the Prophets. Let thine affairs, both public and private, be in Allah's charge, and fear Him with the fear of one who knoweth he is dead and who fareth towards Resurrection and Judgement stead between the hands of the Lord of Dread; and remember that to one of two houses thou art sped, either for Heavens eterne or to the Hell fires that burn.' Thereupon the old woman sat down beside the damsels. Now when thy father, who hath found mercy, heard their discourse, he knew that they were the most accomplished of the people of their time; and, seeing their beauty and loveliness and the extent of their wisdom and lore, he showed them all favour. Moreover, he turned to the ancient dame and treated her with honour, and set apart for her and her damsels the palace which had lodged Princess Abrizah, daughter of the King of Greece, to which he bade carry all the luxuries they needed. They abode with him ten days and the old woman abode with them; and, whenever the King visited them, he found her absorbed in prayer, watching by night and fasting by day; whereby love of her took hold upon his heart and he said to me, 'O Wazir, verily this old woman is of the pious, and awe of her is strong in my heart.' Now on the eleventh day, the King visited her, that he might pay her the price of the damsels; but she said to him, 'O King, know that the price of these maidens surpasseth the competence of men; indeed I seek not for them either gold or silver or jewels, be it little or much.' Now when thy father heard these words he wondered and asked her, 'O my lady and what is their price?'; whereto she answered, 'I will not sill them to thee save on condition that thou fast, watching by night a whole month, and abstaining by day, all for the love of Allah Almighty; and, if thou do this, they are thy property to use in thy palace as thou please.' So the King wondered at the perfection of her rectitude and piety and abnegation; she was magnified in his eyes and he said, 'Allah make this pious woman to profit us!' Then he agreed with her to fast for a month as she had stipulated, and she said to him, 'I will help thee with the prayers I pray for thee and now bring me a gugglet of water.' They brought one and she took it and recited over it and muttered spells, and sat for an hour speaking in speech no one understood or knew aught thereof. Lastly she covered it with a cloth and, sealing it with her signet ring, gave it to thy sire, saying, 'When thou hast fasted the first ten days, break thy fast on the eleventh night with what is in this gugglet, for it will root out the love of the world from thy heart and fill it with light and faith. As for me, tomorrow I will go forth to my brethren, the Invisible Controuls, for I yearn after them, and I will return to thee when the first ten days are past. Thy father took the gugglet and arose and set it apart in a closet of his palace, then locked the door and put the key in his pocket. Next day the King fasted and the old woman went her ways.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eighty-fifth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan thus continued to Zau al-Makan, ""Now when came the day for the Sultan's fast, the old woman went her ways. And after he had accomplished the ten days thereof, on the eleventh he opened the gugglet and drank what was therein and found it cordial to his stomach. Within the second ten days of the month the old woman returned, bringing sweetmeats wrapped in a green leaf, like no leaf of known tree. She went in to thy sire and saluted him; and, when he saw her, he rose to her saying, 'Welcome, O pious lady!' 'O King,' quoth she, 'the Invisible Controuls salute thee, for I told them of thee, and they rejoiced in thee and have sent thee their Halwá, which is of the sweetmeats of the other world. Do thou break thy fast on it at the end of the day.' The King rejoiced at this with great joy, and exclaimed, 'Praised be Allah, who hath given me brethren of the Invisible World!' Thereupon he thanked the ancient dame and kissed her hands; and he honoured her and the damsels with exceeding honour. She went forth for the twenty days of thy father's fast at the end of which time she came to him and said, 'Know, O King, that I told the Invisible Controuls of the love which is between me and thee, and informed them how I had left the maidens with thee, and they were glad that the damsels should belong to a King like thee; for they were wont, when they saw them, to be strenuous in offering on their behalf prayers and petitions ever granted. So I would fain carry them to the Invisible Controuls that they may benefit by the breath of their favour, and peradventure, they shall not return to thee without some treasure of the treasures of the earth, that thou, after completing thy fast, mayst occupy thyself with their raiment and help thyself by the money they shall bring thee, to the extent of thy desires.' When thy sire heard her words, he thanked her for them and said, 'Except that I fear to cross thee, I would not accept the treasure or aught else; but when wilt thou set out with them?' Replied she, 'On the seven and twentieth night; and I will bring them back to thee at the head of the month, by which time thou wilt have accomplished thy fast and they will have had their courses and be free from impurity; and they shall become thine and be at thy disposal. By Allah, each damsel of them is worth many times thy kingdom!' He said, 'I know it, O pious lady!' Then quoth the old woman, 'There is no help but that thou send with them someone in thy palace who is dear to thee, that she may find solace and seek a blessing of the Invisible Controuls.' Quoth he, 'I have a Greek slave called Sophia, by whom I have been blessed with two children, a girl and a boy; but they were lost; years ago. Take her with thee that she may get the blessing'""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eighty-sixth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Wazir Dandan continued to Zau al-Makan, ""Quoth thy sire to the ancient woman when she demanded the handmaids of him, 'I have a Greek slave called Sophia, by whom I have been blest with two children, a girl and a boy, but they were lost years ago; so take her with thee, haply she may get the benediction and, belike, the Invisible Controuls will sue Allah for her that her two children may be restored to her.' 'Thou hast said well,' replied she; 'for that indeed was her grievousest want.' Thy sire gave not over finishing his fast till the old woman said to him, 'O my son, I am going to the Invisible Controuls; so bring me Sophia.' Accordingly, he summoned her and she came forthright, and he delivered her to the old woman who mixed her up with the other damsels. Then she went in to her chamber and bringing out a sealed cup, presented it to the Sultan saying, 'On the thirtieth day, do thou repair to the Hammam and when thou comest out, enter one of the closets in thy palace and drink what is in this cup. Then sleep, and thou shalt attain what thou seekest, and peace be with thee'! Thereat the King was glad and thanked her and kissed her hands. Quoth she, 'I commend thee to Allah's care;' whereat quoth he, 'And when shall I see thee again, O pious lady? In very sooth I love not to part with thee.' Then she called down blessings on him and departed with the five damsels and the Queen; whilst the King fasted after her departure other three days, till the month ended, when he arose and went to the Hammam and coming out shut himself up in a closet of his palace, commanding that none should go in to him. There, after making fast the door, he drank what was in the cup and lay down to sleep; and we sat awaiting him till the end of the day, but he did not come out and we said, 'Perchance he is tired with the bath and with watching by night and fasting by day; wherefore he sleepeth.' So we waited till next day; but still he did not come forth. Then we stood at the closet door and cried aloud so haply he might awake and ask what was the matter. But nothing came of that; so at last we lifted up the door; and, going in, found him dead, with his flesh torn into strips and bits and his bones broken. When we saw him in this condition it was grievous to us, and we took up the cup and found within its cover a piece of paper whereon was inscribed, 'Whoso doeth evil leaveth no regrets, and this be the reward of him who playeth traitor with the daughters of Kings and who debaucheth them; and we make known to all who fall upon this scroll that Sharrkan, when he came to our country, seduced our Queen Abrizah; nor did that suffice him but he must needs take her from us and bring her to you. Then he sent her away in company of a black slave who slew her, and we found her lying dead on the desert sward and thrown out to wild beasts. This be no kingly deed, and he who did this is requited with naught but what he merited. So do ye suspect none of having killed him, for no one slew him but the cunning witch, whose name is Zat al-Dawahi. And behold, I have taken the King's wife, Sophia, and have carried her to her father, Afridun King of Constantinople. Moreover, there is no help for it but that we wage war upon you and kill you and take your country from you, and ye shall be cut off even to the last man, nor shall a living soul be spared by Death nor one who bloweth fire with his breath, save he who Cross and Belt worshippeth.' When we read this paper, we knew that the ancient woman had beguiled us and carried out her plot against us: whereupon we cried aloud and buffeted our faces and wept sore when weeping availed us naught. And the troops fell out as to whom they should make Sultan; some would have thee, and others would have thy brother Sharrkan; and we ceased not to dispute about this for the space of a month, at the end of which certain of us drew together and agreed to repair to thy brother Sharrkan: so we set out and journeyed on till we fell in with thee. And such is the manner of the death of Sultan Omar bin al-Nu'uman!"" Now when the Wazir Dandan had made an end of his story, Zau al- Makan and his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman wept; and the Chamberlain, who wept also, said to Zau al-Makan, ""O King, weeping will avail thee naught; nor shall aught profit thee but that thou harden thy heart and strengthen thy stress and establish thy sovranty; for verily whoso leaveth the like of thee is not dead."" Thereupon Zau al-Makan gave over his weeping and caused his throne to be set up without the pavilion, and then commanded the army to pass in review order before him. And the Chamberlain sat by his side and all the armour-bearers behind him, whilst the Wazir Dandan and the rest of the Emirs and Grandees stood each in his individual stead. Then quoth King Zau al-Makan to the Minister Dandan, ""Inform me concerning my sire's treasures;"" and he replied, ""I hear and I obey;"" and gave him to know of the late King's hoards and monies, and what was in the treasury of amassed wealth and jewels, and acquainted him with other precious things. So Zau al-Makan opened his hand to the army, and gave a sumptuous robe of honour to the Wazir Dandan, saying, ""Thou continues"" in office. Whereupon Dandan kissed the ground before him and wished him long life. Then he bestowed dresses on the Emirs, after which he said to the Chamberlain, ""Bring out before me the tribute of Damascus that is with thee."" So he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, when he took them and parted them all amongst the troops,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eighty-seventh Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Zau al- Makan ordered the Chamberlain to bring out before him what he had brought of the tribute of Damascus; and, when he was shown the chests of money and rarities and jewels, he took them and parted them all amongst the troops, till nothing was left. And the Emirs kissed the ground before him and wished him long life, saying, ""Never saw we a King, who gave the like of these gifts."" Then all went away to their tents and when it was morning he gave orders for marching. So they marched for three days, till, on the fourth day, they drew near to Baghdad. When they entered the city, they found it decorated, and Zau al-Makan, the Sultan, went up to his father's palace and sat down on the throne, whilst the Emirs of the army and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain of Damascus stood between his hands. Then he bade his private secretary write a writ to his brother Sharrkan, acquainting him with all that had passed, from first to last, and he concluded, ""As soon as thou hast read this letter, make ready thine affair and join us with thine army, that we may turn to Holy War upon the Infidels and take man bote for our father and wipe out the stain upon our honour."" Then he folded the letter and sealed it with his seal ring and said to the Minister Dandan, ""None shall carry this letter but thou; and it behoveth thee speak my brother fair and say to him, 'If thou have a mind to thy father's kingdom, it is thine, and thy brother shall be Viceroy for thee in Damascus; for to this effect am I instructed by him.'"" So the Wazir went down from before him and made ready for his march. Then Zau al-Makan bade set apart a magnificent house for the Fireman and furnished it with the best of furniture and long is the tale of that Fireman. Presently Zau al-Makan went out chasing and hunting and, as he was returning to Baghdad, one of the Emirs presented him with blood horses and with beauteous handmaids whose description the tongue evades. One of the damsels pleased him: so he went in unto her and knew her that night, and she conceived by him forthright. After a while, the Wazir Dandan returned from his journey, bringing him news of his brother Sharrkan and that he was then on his way to him, and said, ""It were fitting thou go forth to meet him."" Zau al- Makan replied, ""I hear and I consent;"" and riding forth with his Grandees a day's journey from Baghdad, he pitched his pavilions there awaiting his brother. Next morning appeared King Sharrkan amid the army of Syria, a horseman of might, a lion fierce in fight, a prow and doughty knight. As the squadrons drew nigh and the dust clouds came hard by and the troops rode up with banners on high, Zau al-Makan and those with him pushed forward to meet Sharrkan and his men; and when Zau al-Makan saw his brother, he desired to dismount, but Sharrkan conjured him not to do on this wise, and himself footed it, and walked a few paces towards him. As soon as he reached Zau al-Makan, the new Sultan threw himself upon him, and Sharrkan embraced him and wept with great weeping and the twain condoled with each other. Then they mounted and rode onward, they and their troops, till they reached Baghdad, where they alighted and went up to the royal palace and there they passed that night, and when next morning came, Zau al- Makan went forth and bade summon the troops from all parts, and proclaimed a Holy War and a Razzia. They then awaited the coming of the levies from each quarter of the kingdom, and every one who came they entreated with honour and promised him all manner of good; till in so doing a full month had sped, and the fighting men flocked to them in a continuous body. Then Sharrkan said to Zau al-Makan, ""O my brother, tell me thy history."" So he told him all that had befallen him from first to last, including the benevolent dealing of the Fireman with him. Asked Sharrkan, 'Hast thou requited his kindness?""; and he answered, ""O my brother! I have not rewarded him as yet, but Inshallah! I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Eighty-eighth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan asked his brother Zau al-Makan, ""Hast thou requited the Fireman for his kindness?""; and he answered, ""O my brother, I have not rewarded him as yet, but Inshallah! I will recompense him whenas I return from this raid and find time so to do."" Therewith Sharrkan was certified that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, had told him the whole truth; but he concealed what had passed between them and offered his salutation to her by her husband the Chamberlain. She sent him back her greeting, calling down blessings on him and enquiring after her daughter Kuzia-Fakan, to which he replied that the maiden was well and in the best of health and safety. Where upon she praised Almighty Allah and gave him thanks. Then Sharrkan went to his brother to take counsel with him for departure; and Zau al-Makan said, ""O my brother, as soon as the army is complete and the Arabs have come in from all parts, we will march forth."" So he bade make ready the commissariat and prepare munitions of war and went in to his wife, who was now five months gone with child; and he put under her astrologers and mathematicians, to whom he appointed stipends and allowances. Then he set out three months after the arrival of the army of Syria, and as soon as the Arabs were come in and the troops were assembled from all directions; and, as he fared forth, he was followed by the warriors and the united host. Now the name of the General of the Daylam army was Rustam and that of the General of the army of the Turks Bahram. And Zau al- Makan marched in mid host and on his right was his brother Sharrkan, and on his left the Chamberlain his brother-in-law. So the squadrons broke up and pushed forward and the battalions and companies filed past in battle array, till the whole army was in motion. They ceased not to fare on for the space of a month, and each body dismounted at its own ground and there rested every week three days (for the host was great); and they advanced in this order till they came to the country of the Greeks. Then the people of the villages and hamlets and the poorer sort took fright at them and fled to Constantinople. But when King Afridun heard the tidings he arose and betook himself to Zat al-Dawahi, the same who had contrived the stratagem, and had travelled to Baghdad and had slain King Omar bin Al-Nu'uman; and who after carrying off her slaves and Queen Sophia, had returned with them all to her native land. Now when she had been restored to her son, the King of Greece, and felt herself safe, she said to King Hardub, ""Cool thine eyes; for I have avenged by blood the shame of thy daughter Abrizah, and have killed Omar bin al-Nu'uman and have brought back Sophia. So now let us go to the King of Constantinople and carry to him his daughter and acquaint him with what hath happened, that all of us be on guard and prepare our forces; and I will fare with thee to King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, for I opine that the Moslems will not await our attack."" Said Hardub, ""Tarry thou till they draw near our country, that we may make us ready meantime and assemble our power."" Accordingly they took to levying their forces and preparing for war, and, when the news of the Moslems' advance reached them, they were prepared for defence; and Zat al Dawahi had preceded them. Now when she and her son arrived at Constantinople, the King of Kings, Afridun, hearing of the approach of Hardub, King of the Greeks, came forth to meet him and asked how it was with him and the cause of his visit. So Hardub acquainted him with the cunning doings of his mother, Zat al-Dawahi, how she had slain the Moslem King and recovered from him Queen Sophia, and had said, ""The Moslems have assembled their forces and are on their way to attack us, wherefore it behoveth that we two join hands in single band and meet them."" Now King Afridun rejoiced in the return of his daughter and the killing of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman; and he sent to all countries seeking succour and acquainting the folk with the cause of slaying the Moslem King. So the Nazarene troops flocked to him and three months were not past ere the army of the Greeks was complete, besides which there joined themselves to him Franks from all their lands, French, Germans and Ragusans, with men of Zara, Venetians, Genoese, and all the hosts of the Yellow Faces; and, when the gathering was at its full, earth was straitened on them by reason of their multitude. Then Afridun, the Great King, ordered a march; so they set out and ceased not to defile through the city for ten days. They fared on till they reached the Wady highs Al-Nu'uman, a broad sided vale hard by the Salt Sea, where they halted three days; and on the fourth they were about to set out again, when news came that the army of Al-Islam on them press, and the defenders of the faith of Mohammed, of Men the Best. So they halted in it other three days, and on the eighth they espied a dust cloud which towered till it walled the whole land; nor was an hour of the day past ere that dust began to drift and was torn to shreds in the lift, and pierced through its shades the starry radiance of lance and the white levee of blades. Presently there appeared beneath it the banners Islamitan and the ensigns Mahometan; the horsemen urged forward, like the letting loose of seas that surged, clad in mail, as they were mackerel-back clouds which the moon enveil; whereupon the two hosts clashed, like two torrents on each other dashed. Eyes fell upon eyes; and the first to seek combat singular was the Wazir Dandan, he and the army of Syria, numbering thirty thousand bridles, and with him were the General of the Turks, and the General of Daylam, Rustam and Bahram, amid twenty thousand horse, behind whom came the men from the shores of the Salt Sea, clad in iron mail, as they were full moons that past through a night o'ercast. Then the Nazarene host called out on Jesus and Mary, and the defiled Cross and they heaped themselves upon the Wazir Dandan and those with him of the Syrian host. Now all this was in pursuance of a stratagem devised by that ancient woman Zat al-Dawahi; for, before his departure, King Afridun had gone in to her and asked her, ""How shall I do and what plan shall I pursue?; it is thou hast caused this great distress to us;"" and she had answered, ""O great King and mighty Cohen! I will teach thee a trick would baffle Iblis himself, though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Eighty-ninth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, all this was a stratagem of the ancient woman, for that the King before his departure had gone to her and asked, ""How shall I do and what plan shall I pursue? it is thou hast caused this great distress to us!"" And she had answered, ""O great King and mighty Cohen, I will teach thee a trick would baffle the Devil himself though he summon to his assistance all his grisly hosts. It is that thou send fifty thousand men going down in ships, and sailing over the sea to the Mountain of Smoke; and there let them land and stir not till {he standards of Al-Islam come upon thee, when do thou up and at them. Then bid the troops from the seaward sally out upon the Moslems and take them in rear, whilst we confront them from the landward. So not one of them shall escape, and our sorrows shall tease and peace abide with us."" Now the counsel of this ancient woman commended itself to King Afridun, and he replied, ""Right is the recking thou reckest, O Princess of wits and recourse of Kings and Cohens warring for their blood wit!"" So when the army of Al-Islam came upon them in chat valley, before they knew of it the flames began to burn up the tents and the swords in men's bodies to make rents. Then hurried up the army of Baghdad and Khorasan who numbered one hundred and twenty thousand horse, with Zau al-Makan in the front of war. When the host of the Infidels that lay by the sea saw them, they sallied out against them and followed in their tracks; and when Zau al- Makan espied this he cried out to his men, ""Turn back to the Infidels, O People of the Chosen Apostle, and slay those who deny and hate the authority of the Compassionating, the Compassionate!"" So they turned and fought with the Christians. Then Sharrkan marched up with another corps of the Moslem host, some hundred thousand men, whilst the Infidels numbered nigh upon a thousand and six hundred thousand men. When the Moslems were united, their hearts were strengthened and they cried out, saying, ""Verily Allah hath pro mised us victory, and to the Infidels hath assigned defeat."" And they clashed together with sword and spear. Now Sharrkan tare through rank and row and raged among the masses of the foe, fighting so fierce a fight as to make children grey grow; nor did he cease tourneying among the infidel horde and working havoc among them with the keen edged sword, shouting ""Allaho Akbar!"" (Allah is Most Great) till he drove back the host to the coast. Then failed the force of the foe and Allah gave victory to the faith of Al-Islam, and folk fought folk, drunken without strong drink till they slew of the Infidels in this affair forty and five thousand, while of the Moslems but three thousand and five hundred fell. Moreover, the Lion of the Faith, King Sharrkan, and his brother, Zau al-Makan, slept not that night, but occupied themselves with congratulating their braves and with looking to the wounded and with assuring the army of victory and salvation and promise of reward in the world to come. Thus far concerning the Moslem; but as regards King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople and Sovran of Roum, and Zat Al-Dawahi, they assembled the Emirs of the host and said to them, ""Verily, we had worked our will and solaced our hearts, but our over confidence in our numbers, and that only, defeated us."" Then quoth to them the ancient one, the Lady of Calamities, ""In very sooth nought shall profit you, except ye draw you nigh unto the Messiah and put your trust in the True Belief, for, by the virtue of the Messiah, the whole strength of the Moslem host lieth in that Satan, King Sharrkan."" ""Tomorrow,"" said King Afridun, ""I have resolved to draw up in battle array and to send out against them that redoubtable cavalier, Lúká bin Shamlút; for if King Sharrkan come forth as a champion to fight single handed, our man will slay him and will slay the other Moslem Knights, till not one is left. And I purpose this night to sacre you all with the Holy Incense."" When the Emirs heard these words they kissed the ground before him. Now the incense which he designated was the excrement of the Chief Patriarch, the denier, the defiler of the Truth, and they sought for it with such instance, and they so highly valued it that the high priests of the Greeks used to send it to all the countries of the Christians in silken wraps after mixing it with musk and ambergris. Hearing of it Kings would pay a thousand gold pieces for every dram and they sent for and sought it to fumigate brides withal; and the Chief Priests and the great Kings were wont to use a little of it as collyrium for the eyes and as a remedy in sickness and colic; and the Patriarchs used to mix their own skite with it, for that the skite of the Chief Patriarch could not suffice for ten countries. So, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen, and King Afridun,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Ninetieth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, as soon as dawn was seen and the morning shone with its shine and sheen, the horsemen ran to their spears full keen and King Afridun summoned his chief Knights and Nobles and invested them with dresses of honour; and, drawing the sign of the cross on their brows, incensed them with the incense which as aforesaid was the skite of the Chief Patriarch, the Cohen, the Heresiarch. This incensing done, he called for Luka bin Shamlut, surnamed the Sword of the Messiah; and, after fumigating him and rubbing his palate with the Holy Merde, caused him to snuff it and smeared his cheeks and anointed his moustaches with the rest. Now there was no stouter champion in the land of Roum than this accursed Luka, nor any better at bending of bow or sway of sword or lunge with lance on the day of devoir; but he was foul of favour, for his face was as the face of an ass, his shape that of an ape and his look as the look of a malignant snake: his presence was grievouser than parting from the beloved make; and blacker than night was his blackness and more fetid than the lion was his breath for foulness; more crooked than a bow was his crookedness and grimmer than the leopard was his ugliness, and he was branded with the mark of the Infidels on face. After this he came up to King Afridun and kissed his feet and stood before him; and the King said to him, ""I desire thou go out against Sharrkan, King of Damascus, son of Omar bin al-Nu'uman, and deliver us from this affliction."" Quoth Luka, ""Hearkening and obedience;"" and the King made the sign of the cross on his forehead and felt assured of help from Heaven being near hand. Then Luka went out from the presence and the accursed one mounted a sorrel horse; he was clad in a red robe and a hauberk of gold set with jewels, and he bore a trident spear, as he were Iblis the damned on the day of drewing out his hosts war to darraign. Then he rode forward, he and his horde of Infidels, even as though they were driving to the Fire, preceded by a herald, crying aloud in the Arabic tongue and saying, ""Ho, sect of Mohammed (upon whom be salutation and salvation!), let none of you come out but your champion Sharrkan, the Sword of Al-Islam, Lord of Damascus in Shám!"" Nor had he made an end of speaking, when arose a tumult in the plain; all the people heard the strain and the whole moving bodies of the armies twain called to mind the Day of Complain. Then the cowards trembled and all necks turned towards the sound, and lo! it was King Sharrkan, son of King Omar bin al-Nu'uman. For when his brother, Zau al-Makan, saw that accursed one push out on the plain, and heard the pursuivant, he turned to Sharrkan and said to him, ""Of a surety they seek for thee."" Said he, ""Should it so be, 'twere most pleasing to me."" So when they made sure of the matter and heard the herald crying in the plain, ""Let none of you come out against me save Sharrkan,"" they knew this cursed Luka to be champion of the land of Roum who had sworn to sweep the earth clean of Moslems. Now he was one of the greatest of villains, a wretch who caused hearts to pain; and the DayIamites, Turks and Kurds dreaded his might and main. Presently Sharrkan crave at him like a lion angry grim, mounted on a courser like a wild gazelle flying snell and slim; and coming nigh to him made the spear he hent to shake as it were a darting snake, and recited these couplets,
""I have a sorrel steed, whose pride is fain to bear the rein, *
             Shall give thee what thou likest not and make thee feel his
             main:
I have a handy limber spear full bright and keen of point, * Upon
             whose shaft the dam of Death her throny seat hath ta'en:
I have a trenchant glaive of Hind; and, when I bare its face * Of
             scabbard"" veil, from out its brow the rays of levee rain.""
Luka understood not the sense of his speech nor did he apprehend the vehemence of the verse; but he smote his forehead with his hand, in honour of the Cross drawn thereon and kissed it; then he couched his throw spear and ran at Sharrkan. But first he tossed the javelin with one hand in air to such height that it was lost to the spectators' sight; and, catching it with the other hand as do the jugglers, hurled it at Sharrkan. It flew from his grasp like a shooting star and folk clamoured and feared for Sharrkan; but, as the spear flew near him, he put out his hand and caught it in full flight to the amazement of all who saw the sight. Then he shook it with the hand that took it till it was well nigh broken, and hurled it so high into the welkin that it disappeared from view. As it descended, he caught it again with the other hand, in less than the twinkling of an eye, and cried out from his heart core, saying, ""By the truth of Him who created the sevenfold skies, I will assuredly make this cursed wight a byword for mankind to despise!"" Then threw he the throw spear at Luka, who thought to do as Sharrkan had done and put forth his hand to trend it in mid flight; but Sharrkan prevented him, and sped at him a second throw spear which smote him and the point fell on his forehead, in the very centre of the sign of the Cross, and Allah hurried his soul to the Fire and Dwelling place dire. But when the Infidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and they cried, ""Alas!"" and ""Woe worth the day!"" and called for aid upon the Abbots of the monasteries,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Ninety-first Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Infidels saw Luka bin Shamlut fall slain, they buffeted their faces and cried, ""Alas!"" and ""Woe worth the day!"" and called upon the Abbots of the monasteries and cried, ""Where be the crosses?"" So the Religious offered up prayers and the Christians all drew together against Sharrkan; and, brandishing their scymitars and lances, rushed forward to the attack. Then army met army and breasts fell under hoof, whilst spear and sword ruled the day and forearms and wrists grew weak and the coursers seemed created without legs; nor did the herald of-war cease calling to fight, till arms were aweary and day took flight and night came on with darkness dight. So the two hosts drew apart, whilst every brave staggered like a drunken knave, for that with so much cut and thrust they strave; and the place was choked with the slain; fell were the wounds and the hurt knew not by whom they fell. Then Sharrkan joined his brother, Zau al-Makan, and the Chamberlain and the Wazir Dandan, and said to them, ""Verily Allah hath opened a door for the Infidels to fall, praised be the Lord of the Worlds one and all!"" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""Let us never cease to praise Allah, for that He hath dispelled trouble from the Arab and the Ajam. Indeed the folk, generation after generation, shall tell of thy derring do against the accursed Luka, the falsifier of the Evangel; of thy catching the throng spear in mid-flight, and how the enemy of Allah among men thou didst smite; and thy fame shall endure until the end of time."" Then said Sharrkan, ""Harkye, O grand Chamberlain and doughty Capitayne!"" and he answered, ""Adsum!"" Quoth Sharrkan, ""Take with thee the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousand horse, and lead them seven parasangs towards the sea, and force the march till ye shall have come near the shore, and there remain only two parasangs between thee and the foe. Then ambush ye in the hollows of the ground till ye hear the tumult of the Infidels disembarking from their ships; and the war cry from every side strike your ear and ye know that the sabres have begun labour between us and them; and, whenso ye see our troops falling back, as if defeated, and all the Infidels following them, as well those in front as those from the seaward and the tents, do ye still lie in wait for them: but as soon as ye see the standard with the words, There is no god but the God, and Mohammed is God's Apostle (on whom be salutation and salvation!), then up with the green banner, and do your endeavour and fall on their rear and shout, 'Alla ho Akbar! Allah is most Great!' and circle round that they may not interpose between the retreating army and the sea."" He replied, ""To hear is to obey!""; and forthright they agreed upon this matter and they went forth. Now the Chamberlain took with himself the Wazir Dandan and twenty thousand men even as Sharrkan had commanded. As soon as dawned the morn, the troops sprung to horse when they had donned their armour gear and drawn the scymitar and slung the spear. Then the Christians dispread themselves over hill and dale and the Ecclesiasts cried out and all heads were bared, and those in the ships hoisted the Cross at their mast heads and began making for shore from every side, and landed their horses and get them ready for fight and fray, whilst the sword blades glittered bright and the javelins glanced like levee light on mail shirt white; and all joined fight and the grind mill of Death whirled round and ground those who fought from horse and aground: heads from bodies flew end tongues mute grew and eyes no vision knew. Scymitars strave with utmost strain and heads flew over the battle plain; gall bladders crave and wrists were shorn in twain; steeds plashed in pools of gore and beards were gripped right sore; the host of Al-Islam called out, saying, ""On the Prince of Mankind be blessings and peace, and to the Compassionate glory and praise, which ne'er shall cease, for His boons which aye increase;"" and the host of the Infidels shouted, ""Glory to the Cross and the Belt and the vine press juice, and the wine presser and the Priests and the Monks and the Festival of Palms and the Metropolitan!"" Now Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan held back and their troops gave way and feigned flight from before the enemy, while the Infidel array pressed hard upon them deeming them in rout, and made ready to foin and hew. Then the meiny of the Moslems raised their voices, reciting the first verses of the Chapter of the Cow, whilst the dead were trampled under hoofs of steeds, and the heralds of the Greeks cried out, ""Ho, servants of the Messiah! Ho, people of the True Faith! Ho, followers of the Primate! Verily Divine grace upon you opes; for see, the hosts of Al Islam like birds with broken wings incline to elope! So turn ye not to them your backs, but let your swords cleave deep in their necks and hold not your hands from them, else are ye outcasts from the Messiah, Mary's son, who spoke even when a cradled one!"" Now Afridun, King of Constantinople, deemed that the Infidels were victorious, knowing not that this was but a clever stratagem of the Moslems, and sent to King Hardub of Roum congratulations on success, adding, ""Availed us naught but the Holy Merde of the Arch Patriarch, whose fragrance exhaled from the beards and mustachios of the slaves of the Cross near and far; and I swear, by the Miracles of the Messiah; and by thy daughter Abrizah, the Nazarene, the Mariolater; and by the Waters of Baptism, that I will not leave upon the earth a single defender of Al- Islam! And to the bitter end will I carry out this plan."" So the messenger betook himself with the address to King Hardub, whilst the Infidels called to one another saying, ""Take we vengeance wreak for Luka!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Ninety-second Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Infidels called to one another, saying, ""Take we vengeance wreak for Luka!"" while Hardub King of Greece cried aloud, ""Ho, to our revenge for Abrizah!"" Thereupon King Zau al-Makan shouted ""Ho, servants of the Requiting King!: smite the children of denial and disobedience with the blanch of sword and the brown of spear!"" So the Moslems returned to the Infidels and plied them with the keen edged scymitar, whilst their herald cried aloud, ""Up, and at the foes of the Faith, all ye who love the Prophet Elect, with hope of salvation on the Day of Fear, to win favour of the Bountiful, the Forgiving One; for verily the Garden of Paradise is under the shadow of swords!"" And behold, Sharrkan and his men charged down upon the Infidels and cut off their retreat and wheeled and tourneyed among the ranks; when lo! a knight of goodly presence opened a passage through the army of Unbelievers and circled hither and thither amongst the Deniers, cutting and thrusting and covering the ground with heads and trunks, so that the Faithless feared him and their necks bent under his lunge and hew. He was girt with two swords, his glances and his brand, and he was armed with two lances, one of bamboo cane and the other his straight wand like shape; and his flowing hair stood him in stead of many warriors, even as saith the poet,
""Laud not long hair, except it be dispread * In two fold
            locks, on day of fight and fray,
O'er youth who bears his lance 'twixt flank and thigh, * From
             many a whis kered knight to win the day.""
And as singeth another,
""I say to him, what while he slings his sword, * 'For sword shall
             serve those looks that sword like show!'
Says he, 'My sabre looks for those I love, * My sword for those
             who sweets of love unknow!'""
When Sharrkan saw him, he said to him, ""I conjure thee by the Koran and the attributes of the Compassionate One, O Champion of the Champions! tell me who thou art: for verily by thy deeds this day thou hast pleased the Requiting King, whom one thing distracteth not from other thing; in that thou hast been discomforting the children of impiety and in rebellion revelling."" Then cried the Cavalier to him saying, ""Thou art he who madest brother covenant with me but yesterday: how quickly thou hast forgotten me!"" Thereupon he withdrew his mouth veil, so that what was hidden of his beauty was disclosed, and lo! it was none other than Zau al-Makan. Then Sharrkan rejoiced in his brother, save that he feared for him the rush of fighting and the crush of braves a smiting; and this for two reasons, the first, his tender age and exposure to the evil eye, and the second, that his safety was to the kingdom the greater of the two overshadowing wings. So he said to him, ""O King! thou riskest thy life, so join thy steed to mine; in very sooth I fear for thee from the foe; and better thou stint hazarding thyself forth of these squadrons, that we may shoot at the enemy thine unerring shaft."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""I desire to even thee in fray and I will not be niggard of myself before thee in the melay."" Then the host of Al-Islam, heaping itself upon the Infidels, girt them on all sides, warred on them a right Holy War, and brake the power of the children of impiety and pride and stowre. But King Afridun sighed when he saw the evil wreak that had fallen on the Greek, and they turned their backs from fight and addressed themselves to flight, making for the ships, when lo! there came out upon them from the seacoast another host, led by the Minister Dandan, the champion who was wont to make champions bite the dust, and to lay load on them with cut and thrust. Nor less came forth the Emir Bahram, Lord of the Provinces of Sham, amid twenty thousand horse doughty of arm; and the host of Al-Islam pressed them in front and on flank and wrought them grievous harm. Then a body of the Moslems turned against those who in the ships remained, and perdition on them rained, till they threw themselves into the main, and they slew of them many slain, more than a hundred thousand noblemen, nor was one of their champions, great or small, saved from bale and bane. Moreover, they took their ships, with all the money and treasure and cargo, save a score of keel, and the Moslems got that loot whose like was never gotten in by gone years; nor was such cut and thrust ever heard of by men's ears. Now amongst the booty were fifty thousand horses, besides treasure and spoil past reckoning and arithmetic, whereat the Moslems rejoiced with an exceeding joy for that Allah had given them victory and protection. Such was the case with them; but as regards the fugitive Infidels they soon reached Constantinople, whither the tidings preceded them that King Afridun had prevailed over the Moslems; so quoth the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, ""I know that my son Hardub, King of Roum, is no runagate and that he feareth not the Islamitic hosts, but will restore the whole world to the Nazarene faith."" Then she bade the Great King, Afridun, give command that the city be decorated, and the people held festival high and drank their wines drunkenly and knew not the decrees of Destiny. Now whilst they were in the midst of their rejoicings, behold, the raven of dule and downfall croaked over them, and up came the twenty fugitive ships wherein was the King of Cæsarea. So King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, met them on the sea shore, and they told him all that had befallen them from the Moslem, and they wept sore and groaned and moaned; and rejoicing at weal was turned into dismay for unheal; and they informed him concerning Luka son of Shamlut, how calamity had betided him and how Death had shot him with his shaft. Thereat the horrors of Doomday rose upon King Afridun, and he knew that there was no making straight their crook. Then came up from them the sound of weeping and wailing; the city was full of men mourning and the keepers were keening, and sighs and cries were heard from all sides. And when King Hardub of Greece met King Afridun he told him the truth of the case and how the flight of the Moslems was by way of stratagem and deceit, and said to him, ""Look not to see any of the army, save those who have already reached thee."" When King Afridun heard these words he fell down in a fainting fit, with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, he exclaimed, ""Surely the Messiah was wroth with them that he caused the Moslems to prevail over them!"" Then came the Arch Patriarch sadly to the King who said to him, ""O our father, annihilation hath overtaken our army and the Messiah hath punished us!"" Replied the Patriarch, ""Grieve not nor feel concerned, for it cannot be but that one of you have sinned against the Messiah, and all have been punished for his offence; but now we will read prayers for you in the churches, that the Mohammeden hosts may be repelled from you."" After which the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, came to Afridun and said to him, ""O King, verily the Moslem hosts are many, and we shall never overcome them save by wile: wherefore I purpose to work upon them by guile and repair to this army of Al-Islam, haply I may win my wish of their leader and slay their champion, even as I slew his father. If my stratagem succeed in his case, not one of the host he leads shall return to his native land, for all are strong only because of him; but I desire to have some Christian dwellers of Syria, such as go out every month and year to sell their goods, that they may help me (for this they can do) in carrying out my plan."" Replied the King, ""Be it so whenever thou wilt."" So she bade fetch an hundred men, natives of Najrán, in Sham, and the King asked them, ""Have ye not heard what hath befallen the Christians with the Moslems?"" ""Yes,"" answered they; and he rejoined, ""Know ye that this woman hath devoted her life to the Messiah and purposeth to go forth with you, disguised as Monotheists and Mohammedans, to work out a device which shall profit us and hinder the Moslem from us: say, then, are ye also willing to devote yourselves to the Anointed and I will give you a quintal of gold? He of you who escapeth shall have the money, and him of you who dieth will the Messiah reward."" ""O King,"" replied they, ""we will devote our lives to the Messiah, and we will be thy sacrifice."" Thereupon the old woman took all she required of aromatic roots and placed them in water which she boiled over the fire till the black essence of them was extracted. She waited till the decoction was cold, then dipped the corner of a long kerchief therein and stained her face therewith. Moreover, she donned over her clothes a long gaberdine with an embroidered border and took in her hand a rosary, and afterwards went in to King Afridun, who knew her not, nor did any of his companions know her, till she discovered herself to them: and there was none in the assembly but who thanked and praised her for her cunning; and her son rejoiced and said, ""May the Messiah never fail thee!"" Thereupon she took with her the Syrian Christians, and set out for the army of Baghdad.— And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Ninety-third Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Afridun heard these words, he fell into a fainting fit with his nose under his feet; and, as soon as he revived, fear fluttered the scrotum below his belly and he complained to the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi. Now this accursed old woman was a witch of the witches, past mistress in sorcery and deception; wanton and wily, deboshed and deceptious; with foul breath, red eyelids, yellow cheeks, dull brown face, eyes bleared, mangy body, hair grizzled, back humped, skin withered and wan and nostrils which ever ran. But she had studied the scriptures of Al-Islam and had made the Pilgrimage to the Holy House of Meccah and all this that she might come to the knowledge of the Mohammedan ordinances and the miraculous versets of the Koran; and she had professed Judaism in the Holy City of Jerusalem for two years' space, that she might master the magic of men and demons; so that she was a plague of plagues and a pest of pests, wrong headed as to belief and to no religion fief. Now the chief reason of her sojourn with her son, King Hardub of Greece, was on account of the slave virgins at his court: for she was given to tribadism and could not exist without sapphism or she went mad: so if any damsel pleased her, she was wont to teach her the art of rubbing clitoris against clitoris and would anoint her with saffron till she fainted away for excess of volupty. Whoso obeyed her she was wont to favour and make her son incline towards her; but whoso repelled her she would contrive to destroy; and so she abode for a length of time. This was known to Marjanah and Rayhánah and Utrijah, the handmaids of Abrizah, and their Princess loathed the old woman and abhorred to lie with her, because of the rank smell from her armpits, the stench of her fizzles more fetid than carrion, and the roughness of her hide coarser than palm fibre. She was wont to bribe those who rubbed parts with her by means of jewels and instructions; but Abrizah held aloof from her and sought refuge with the Omnipotent, the Omniscient; for, by Allah, right well quoth the poet,
""Ho thou who grovellest low before the great * Nor over fording
             lesser men dost blench
Who gildest dross by dirham gathering, * No otter scent disguises
             carrion stench!
And now to return to the story of her stratagem and the woes of her working. Presently she departed, taking the chief Nazarenes with their hosts, and turned towards the army of the Moslems. Whereupon King Hardub went in to King Afridun and said to him, ""O King, we have no need of the Chief Patriarch nor of his prayers, but will consult my mother's counsel and observe what she will do with her craft unending against the Moslem hosts; for these are marching with all their power, they will soon be upon us and they will encircle us on all sides."" When King Afridun heard this, terror took hold upon his heart and he wrote letters, without stay or delay, to all the nations of the Nazarenes, saying, ""It behoveth none of the Messiahites or Cross knights to hold back, especially the folk of the strongholds and forts: but let them all come to us, foot and horse, women and children, for the Moslem hosts already tread our soil. So haste! haste ye! ere what we fear to us here appear."" Thus much concerning them; but regarding the work of the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi; when she went forth from the city with her suite, she clad them in the clothing of Moslem merchants, having provided herself with an hundred mules carrying stuffs of Antioch, such as goldwoven satins and royal brocades and so forth. And she had taken a letter from King Afridun to the following effect: ""These be merchantmen from the land of Sham who have been with us: so it besitteth none to do them harm or hindrance, nor take tax and tithe of them, till they reach their homes and safe places, for by merchants a country flourisheth, and these are no men of war nor of ill faith."" Then quoth the accursed Zat al-Dawahi to those with her, ""Verily I wish to work out a plot for the destruction of the Moslem."" Replied they, ""O Queen, command us whatso thou wilt; we are at thy disposal and may the Messiah never disappoint thy dealings!"" Then she donned a gown of fine white wool and rubbed her forehead, till she made a great mark as of a scar and anointed it with an ointment of her own fashion, so that it shone with prodigious sheen. Now the old hag was lean bodied and hollow eyed, and she bound her legs tightly round with cords just above her feet, till she drew near the Moslem camp, when she unwound them, leaving their marks deeply embedded in her ankles. Then she anointed the wheels with dragon's blood and bade her companions beat her with a severe beating, and set her in a chest and, quoth she, ""Cry abroad the Refrain of Unity, nor fear from it aught of damage!"" Replied they, ""How can we beat thee, who be our sovereign lady, Zat al-Dawahi, mother of the King we glory in?"" Then said she, ""We blame not nor deal reproach to him who goeth to the jakes, and in need evil becometh good deed. When ye have set me in the chest, take it and make it one of the bales and place it on mule back and fare forth with it and the other goods through the Moslem camp, and fear ye no blame. And if any of the Moslems hinder you, give up the mules and their lading and be take yourselves to their King, Zau al-Makan, and implore his protection saying, 'We were in the land of the Infidels and they took nothing from us, but wrote us a passport, that none shall do us hindrance or work our mischance.' If he ask you, 'What profit had ye of your property in the land of Roum?' answer him, 'We profited in the deliverance of a pious man, who had been bound down in an underground cell nigh fifteen years, crying out for help yet none helped him. Nay, the Infidels tortured him night and day. We knew not this; but, after we had tarried in Constantinople for some time, having sold our goods and bought others in their stead, we determined on and made ready for a return to our native land. We spent that night conversing about our journey and when day broke, we saw figured upon the wall a human form and as we drew nigh it, behold, it moved and said, 'O Moslems, is there amongst you one who is minded to woo the favour of the Lord of the three Worlds?' 'How so?' asked we; and the figure answered, 'Know that Allah hath made me speak to you, to the intent that your faith be fortified, and that your belief embolden you and that you may go forth of the country of the Infidels and repair to the Moslem host; for with them wones the Sword of the Com passionate One, of our Age the Champion, King Sharrkan, by whom He shall conquer Constantinople town and destroy the sect of the Nazarene. And when ye shall have journeyed three days, you will find an hermitage known as the Hermitage of the ascetic Matruhina and containing a cell; visit it with pure intent and contrive to arrive there by force of will, for therein is a Religious from the Holy City, Jerusalem, by name Abdullah, and he is one of the devoutest of mankind, endowed with the power of working saintly miracles such as dispel doubts and obscurity. Certain of the monks seized him by fraud and shut him up in a souterrain where he hath lain a long time. By his deliverance you will please the Lord of Faithful Men, for such release is better than fighting for the Faith.'"" Now when the ancient dame and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, ""As soon as that which I impart shall reach the ears of King Sharrkan, say him further, 'Hearing this from that image we knew that the holy man'""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Ninety-fourth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, and those with her had agreed upon such words, she said, ""Now as soon as that which I impart shall reach the ears of King Sharrkan say him further, 'Hearing these words from that image we knew that the holy man was indeed of the chiefest devotees and Allah's servants of purest qualities; so we made three days' march till we came in sight of that hermitage, and then we went up to it and passed the day in buying and selling, as is the wont of merchants. As soon as day had departed our sight and night was come to darken light, we repaired to the cell wherein was the dungeon, and we heard the holy man, after chanting some verses of the Koran, repeat the following couplets,
'My heart disheartened is, my breast is strait, * And sinks my
            soul in sea of bale and bate
Unless escape be near I soon shall die; * And Death were better
             than this doleful strait:
O Lightning an thou light my home and folk, * An their still
             brighter charms thy shine abate,
Say, what my path to meet them, being barred * By wars, and
             barricado'd succour's gate?'
""When once ye have brought me into the Moslem camp, and I mix with them you shall see,"" the old woman continued, ""how I will make shift to beguile them and slay them all, even to the last man."" The Nazarenes hearing whet she said, kissed her hands and set her in the chest, after they had beaten her with a grievous beating in obedience to her commands, for they saw it was incumbent on them to do her bidding in this; then they all made for the Moslem host as hath erst been said. Such was the case with the damned hag, Zat al-Dawahi and her companions; but as regards the Mohammeden army, they indeed, after Allah had given them victory over their enemies and they had plundered everything in the ships of money and hoards, all sat down to converse with one another and Zau al-Makan said to his brother Sharrkan, ""Verily, Allah hath granted us to prevail because of our just dealing and discipline and concord amongst ourselves; wherefore continue, O Sharrkan, to obey my commandment, in submission to Allah (be He exalted and extolled!), for I mean to slay ten Kings in blood revenge for my sire, to cut the throat of fifty thousand Greeks and to enter Constantinople."" Replied Sharrkan, ""My life be thy ransom against death! Needs must I follow out the Holy War, though I wone many a year in their country. But I have, O my brother, in Damascus a daughter, named Kuzia Fakan, whom I love heartily for she is one of the marvels of the time and she will soon be of age.' Said Zau al-Makan, ""And I also have left my wife with child and near her time, nor do I know what Allah will vouchsafe me by her. But promise me, O my brother, that if Allah bless me with a son, thou wilt grant me thy daughter for wife to him, and make covenant with me and pledge me thy faith thereon."" ""With love and good will, replied Sharrkan; and, stretching out his hand to his brother, he said, If she bring thee a son, I will give him my daughter Kuzia Fakan, to wife."" At this Zau al-Makan rejoiced, and they fell to congratulating each other on the victory over the enemy. And the Wazir Dandan also congratulated the two brothers and said to them, ""Know, O ye Kings, that Allah hath given us the victory, for that we have devoted our lives to Him (be He exalted and ex tolled!); and we have left our homes and households; and it is my counsel that we follow up the foe and press upon him and harass him, so haply Allah shall enable us to win our wishes, and we shall destroy our enemies, branch and root. If it please you, do ye go down in these ships and sail over the sea, whilst we fare forward by land and bear the brunt of battle and the thrust of fight."" And the Minister Dandan ceased not to urge them to combat and repeated his words who said,
""To slay my foes is chiefest bliss I wist, * And on the courser's
            back be borne a list;
Comes promising tryst a messenger from friend * Full oft, when
            comes the friend withouten tryst.""
And these words of another,
""War for my mother (an I live) I'll take; * Spear for my brother;
           scymitar for sire
With every shag haired brave who meets his death * Smiling, till
           won from Doom his dear desire!""
And when the Wazir ended his verses, he said, ""Praise be to Him who aided us dear victory to uphold and who hath given us spoil of silver and fine gold!"" Then Zau al-Makan commanded the army to depart; and they fared on forcing their marches for Constantinople, till they came to a wide and spacious champaign, full of all things fair and fain, with wild cattle frisking and gazelles pacing to and fro across the plain. Now they had traversed great deserts and drink had been six days cut off from them, when they drew near this meadow and saw therein waters founting and ripe fruits daunting and that land as it were Paradise; for it had donned its adornments and decked itself. Gently waved the branches of its trees drunken with the new wine of the dew, and combined with the nectar of Tasnim the soft breathings of the morning breeze. Mind and gazer were confounded by its beauty, even as saith the poet,
""Behold this lovely garden! 'tis as though * Spring o'er its
           frame her greeny cloak had spread.
Looking with fleshly eyne, thou shalt but sight * A lake whose
            waters balance in their bed,
But look with spirit eyes and lo! shalt see * Glory in every
           leaf o'erwaves thy head.""
And as another saith,
""The stream's a cheek by sunlight rosy dyed, * Whose down
          is creeping shade of tamarisk stems
Round legs of tree trunks waveless roll in rings * Silvern, and
           blossoms are the diadems.""
When Zau al-Makan saw this champaign, with its trees bowing and its flowers blooming and its birds warbling, he called to his brother Sharrkan and said, ""O my brother, verily in Damascus is naught the like of this place. We will not march from it save after three days, that we may take rest ourselves and that the army of Al-Islam may regain strength and their souls be fortified to encounter the blamed Infidels."" So they halted therein and while camping behold, they heard a noise of voices from afar, and Zau al-Makan asked the cause thereof, and was answered that a caravan of merchants from the Land of Syria had halted there to rest and that the Moslem troops had come on them and had haply seized something of the goods which they had brought from the country of the Infidels. After a while up came the merchants, crying out and appealing to the King for aidance. When Zau al- Makan saw this, he bade them be brought before him and, when in presence they said to him, ""O King, we have been in the country of the Infidels and they plundered us of nothing: why then do our brothers the Moslems despoil our goods, and we in their own land? Of a truth when we saw your troops, we went up to them and they robbed us of what we had with us and we have now reported to thee all that hath befallen us."" Thereupon they brought out to him the letter of the King of Constantinople, and Sharrkan read it and said, ""We will presently restore to you what hath been taken from you; but yet it behoveth you not to carry merchandise to the country of the Infidels."" Replied they, ""O our Lord, in very sooth Allah despatched us thither that we might win what Gházi never won the like of, not even thou in all thy razzias."" Asked Sharrkan, ""What was it ye won?"" ""O King,"" answered they, ""we will not tell thee save in private; for if this matter be noised among the folk, haply it may come to the ears of some, and this will be the cause of our ruin and of the ruin of all Moslems who resort to the land of the Greeks."" Now they had hidden the chest wherein was the damned Zat al- Dawahi. So Zau al-Makan and his brother brought them to a private place, where they laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee, and wept till they made the two Kings weep.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Ninety-fifth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the Nazarenes who wore merchants' weed, when brought to a private place by Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan, laid bare to both of them the story of the devotee and wept till they made the two Kings weep and repeated to them all which had been taught by the old witch Zat al-Dawahi. Thereupon Sharrkan's heart yearned to the devotee and he was moved to ruth for him and was fired with zeal for the service of Almighty Allah. So quoth he to them, ""Did ye rescue this holy man or is he still in the hermitage?"" Quoth they, ""We delivered him and slew the hermit, fearing for our lives; after which we made haste to fly for dread of death; but a trusty man told us that in this hermitage are quintals of gold and silver and stones of price."" Then they fetched the chest and brought out the accursed old woman, as she were a cassia pod for excess of blackness and leanness, and she was laden with the same fetters and shackles. When Zau al-Makan and the bystanders saw her, they took her for a man of the best of Allah's devotees and surpassing in pious qualities, more especially because of the shining of her forehead for the ointment wherewith she had anointed her face. So Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan wept sore; then they rose up in honour and kissed her hands and feet, sobbing aloud: but she signed to them and said, ""Cease this weeping and hear my words. Hereat they dried their tears in obedience to her bidding, and she said, ""Know ye both that I was content to accept what my Lord did unto me, for I kenned that the affliction which befel me was a trial from Him (be He exalted and extolled!); and whoso hath not patience under calamity and tribulation, for him there is no coming to the delights of Paradise. I had indeed supplicated Him that I might return to my native land, not as a compensation for the sufferings decreed to me, but that I might die under the horse hoofs of warriors fighting for the Faith who, being slain in fray, live again without suffering death."" Then she repeated the following couplets,
""Our Fort is Tor, and flames the fire of fight: * Moses
            art thou and this is time for aid:
Cast down thy rod, 'twill swallow all they wrought, * Nor dread
            for men their ropes be vipers made.
For Chapters read on fight day lines of foes, * And on their
            necks 'grave versets wi' thy blade!""
When the old woman had ended her verse, her eyes overflowed with tears and her forehead under the unguent shone like gleaming light, and Sharrkan rose and kissed her hand and caused food be brought before her: but she refused it, saying, ""I have not broken my fast by day for fifteen years; and how should I break it at such a time when my Lord hath been bountiful to me in delivering me from the captivity of the Infidels and removing from me that which was more grievous to me than torment of fire? I will wait till sun down."" So when it was nightfall, Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan came and served her with food and said, ""Eat, O ascetic!"" But she said, ""This is no time for eating; it is the time for worshipping the Requiting King."" Then she stood up in the prayer niche and remained praying till the night was spent; and she ceased not to do after this fashion for three days and nights, sitting not but at the time of the Salám or salutation ending with several prayers. When Zau al- Makan saw her on this wise, firm belief in her get hold of his heart and he said to Sharrkan, ""Cause a tent of perfumed leather to be pitched for this Religious, and appoint a body servant to wait upon him."" On the fourth day she called for food; so they brought her all kinds of meats that could seduce the sense or delight the sight; but of all this she would eat only a scone with salt. Then she again turned to her fast and, as the night came, she rose anew to pray; when Sharrkan said to Zau al-Makan, ""Verily, this man carrieth renunciation of the world to the extreme of renouncing, and, were it not for this Holy War, I would join myself to him and worship Allah in his service, till I came before His presence. And now I desire to enter his tent and talk with him for an hour."" Quoth Zau al-Makan, ""And I also: tomorrow we sally forth to fight against Constantinople, and we shall find no time like the present."" Said the Wazir Dandan, ""And I no less desire to see this ascetic; haply he will pray for me that I find death in this Holy War and come to the presence of my Lord, for I am aweary of the world."" So as soon as night had darkened, they repaired to the tent of that witch, Zat al-Dawahi; and, seeing her standing to pray, they drew near her and fell a weeping for pity of her; but she paid no heed to them till midnight was past, when she ended her orisons by pronouncing the salutation. Then she turned to them and after wishing them long life, asked them ""Wherefore come ye?"", whereto they answered, ""O thou holy man! diddest thou not hear us weep around thee?"" She rejoined, ""To him who standeth in the presence of Allah, remaineth no existence in time, either for hearing any or for seeing aught about him."" Quoth they, ""We would have thee recount to us the cause of thy captivity and pray for us this night, for that will profit us more than the possession of Constantinople."" Now when she heard their words she said, ""By Allah, were ye not the Emirs of the Moslems, I would not relate to you aught of this at any time; for I complain not but to Allah alone. However, to you I will relate the circumstances of my captivity. Know, then, that I was in the saintly City of Jerusalem with certain ecstatics and inspired men, and did not magnify myself among them, for that Allah (be He exalted and extolled!) had endowed me with humility and abnegation, till I chanced to go down to the sea one night and walked upon the water. Then entered into me pride; whence I know not, and I said to myself, 'Who like me can walk the water?' And my heart from that time hardened and Allah afflicted me with the love of travel. So I journeyed to Roum land and visited every part for a whole year, and left no place but therein I worshiped Allah. When I came to this spot, I clomb the mountain and saw there an hermitage, inhabited by a monk called Matrubina, who, when he sighted me, came out and kissed my hands and feet and said, 'Verily, I have seen thee since thou enteredst the land of the Greeks, and thou hast filled me with longing for the land of Al-Islam.' Then he took my hand and carried me into that hermitage, and brought me to a dark room; and, when I entered it unawares, he locked the door on me and left me there forty days, without meat or drink; for it was his intent to kill me by delay. It chanced one day, that a Knight called Dakianús came to the hermitage, accompanied by ten squires and his daughter Tamásil, a girl whose beauty was incom parable. When they entered that hermitage, the monk Matruhina told them of me, and the Knight said, 'Bring him out, for surely there is not on him a bird's meal of meat.' So they opened the door of the dark room and found me standing in the niche, praying and reciting the Koran and glorifying Allah and humbling myself before the Almighty. When they saw me in this state Matrohina exclaimed, 'This man is indeed a sorcerer of the sorcerers!'; and hearing his words, they all came in on me, Dakianus and his company withal, and they beat me with a grievous beating, till I desired death and reproached myself, saying, 'This is his reward who exalteth himself and who prideth himself on that which Allah hath vouchsafed to him, beyond his own competence! And thou, O my soul, verily self esteem and arrogance have crept into thee. Dost thou not know that pride angereth the Lord and hardeneth the heart and bringeth men to the Fire?' Then they laid me in fetters and returned me to my place which was the dungeon under ground. Every three days, they threw me down a scone of barley bread and a draught of water; and every month or two the Knight came to the hermitage. Now his daughter Tamasil had grown up, for she was nine years old when I first saw her, and fifteen years passed over me in captivity, so that she had reached her four and twentieth year. There is not in our land nor in the land of the Greeks a fairer than she, and her father feared lest the King take her from him; for she had vowed herself to the Messiah and rode with Dakianus in the habit of a cavalier, so that albeit none might compare with her in loveliness, no one who saw her knew her for a woman. And her father had laid up his monies in this hermitage, every one who had aught of price or treasured hoard being wont to deposit it therein; and I saw there all manner of gold and silver and jewels and precious vessels and rarities, none may keep count of them save Almighty Allah. Now ye are worthier of these riches than those Infidels; so lay hands on that which is in the hermitage and divide it among the Moslems and especially on fighters in the Holy War. When these merchants came to Constantinople and sold their merchandise, that image which is on the wall spoke to them, by grace of a marvel which Allah granted to me; so they made for that hermitage and slew Matruhina, after torturing him with most grievous torments, and dragging him by the beard, till he showed them the place where I was; when they took me and found no path but flight for dread of death. Now tomorrow night Tamasil will visit that hermitage as is her habit, and her father and his squires will come after her, as he feareth for her; so, if ye would witness these things, take me with you and I will deliver to you the monies and the riches of the Knight Dakianus which be in that mountain; for I saw them bring out vessels of gold and silver to drink therefrom, and I heard a damsel of their company sing to them in Arabic and well-away! that so sweet a voice should not be busied in chaunting the Koran. If, then, ye will; enter into that hermitage and hide there against the coming of Dakianus and his daughter; and take her, for she is fit only for the King of the Age, Sharrkan, or King Zau al-Makan."" Thereat they all rejoiced with the exception of the Wazir Dandan, who put scant faith in her story, for her words took no hold on his reason, and signs of doubt in her and disbelief showed in his face. Yet he was confounded at her discourse, but he feared to speak with her for awe of the King. Then quoth the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, ""Verily, I fear lest the Knight come and, seeing these troops encamped in the meadow, be afraid to enter the hermitage."" So Zau al-Makan ordered the army to march upon Constantinople and said, ""I have resolved to take with me an hundred horse and many mules and make for that mountain, where we will load the beasts with the monies which be in the hermitage."" Then he sent at once for the Chief Chamberlain whom they brought into the presence; and he summoned likewise the leaders of the Turks and Daylamites and said, ""As soon as it is dawn, do ye set forth for Constantinople; and thou, O Chamberlain, shalt take my place in council and contrivance, while thou, O Rustam, shalt be my brother's deputy in battle. But let none know that we are not with you and after three days we will rejoin you."" Then he chose out an hundred of the doughtiest riders, and he and Sharrkan and the Minister Dandan set out for the hermitage, and the hundred horsemen led the mules with chests for transporting the treasure.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Ninety-sixth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan and his brother, Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan set off with an hundred horse for the hermitage described to them by that accursed Zat al-Dawahi, and they took with them mules and chests for transporting the treasure. Now as soon as dawned the morn, the Chamberlain signalled to the host an order for departure, and they set out thinking that the two Kings and the Wazir were with them; knowing not that the three had made for the monastery. Such was the case with the host, but as regards the two Kings and the Minister, they tarried in their place till the end of that day. Now the Infidels who were with Zat al-Dawahi took their departure privily, after they had gone in to her and kissed her hands and feet and obtained her leave to march. So she not only gave them permission but also taught them all she minded of wile and guile. And when it was dark night, she arose and went in to Zau al-Makan and his companions and said to them, ""Come, let us set out for the mountain, and take with you a few men at arms."" They obeyed her and left five horsemen at the foot of the mountain, whilst the rest rode on before Zat al-Dawahi, who gained new strength for excess of joy, so that Zau al-Makan said, ""Glory be to Him who sustaineth this holy man, whose like we never saw!"" Now the witch had written a letter to the King of Constantinople and despatched it on the wings of a bird, acquainting him with what had passed and ending, ""I wish thee to send me ten thousand horsemen of the bravest of the Greeks and let them steal along the foot of the mountains with caution, lest the host of Al-Islam get sight of them; and, when they reach the hermitage, let them ambush themselves there, till I come to them with the Moslem King and his brother, for I shall inveigle them and will bring them thither, together with the Wazir and an hundred horse and no more, that I may presently deliver to them the crosses which be in the hermitage. I am resolved to slay the Monk Matruhina, since my scheme cannot be carried out but by taking his life. If my plot work well, not one of the Moslems shall return to his own country; no, not a living wight nor one who blows the fire alight; and Matruhina shall be a sacrifice for the followers of the Nazarene faith and the servants of the Cross, and praise be to the Messiah, first and last."" When this letter reached Constantinople, the keeper of the carrier pigeons carried it to King Afridun, who read it and forthwith inspected his host and equipped ten thousand cavaliers with horses and dromedaries and mules and provaunt and bade them repair to that hermitage and, after reaching the tower, to hide therein. Thus far concerning them; but as regards King Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan and the escort, when they reached the hermitage they entered and met the Monk Matruhina, who came out to see who and what they were; whereupon quoth that pious man Zat al-Dawahi, ""Slay this damned fellow."" So they smote him with their swords and made him drink the cup of death. Then the accursed old woman carried them to the place of offerings and ex votos, and brought out to them treasures and precious things more than she had described to them; and after gathering the whole together, they set the booty in chests and loaded the mules therewith. As for Tamasil, she came not, she or her father, for fear of the Moslems; so Zau al-Makan tarried there, awaiting her all that day and the next and a third, till Sharrkan said to him, ""By Allah, I am troubled anent the army of Al-Islam, for I know not what is become of them."" His brother replied, ""And I also am concerned for them: we have come by this great treasure and I do not believe that Tamasil or any one else will approach the hermitage, after that befel which hath befallen the host of the Christians. It behoveth us, then, to content ourselves with what Allah hath given us and depart; so haply He will help us conquer Constantinople."" Accordingly they came down from the mountain, while Zat al-Dawahi was impotent to oppose their march for fear of betraying her deceit; and they fared forwards till they reached the head of a defile, where the old woman had laid an ambush for them with the ten thousand horse. As soon as these saw the Moslems they encircled them from all sides, couching lance and baring the white sabre blade; and the Infidels shouted the watch word of their faithless Faith and set the shafts of their mischief astring. When Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Minister Dandan looked upon this host, they saw that it was a numerous army and said, ""Who can have given these troops information of us?"" Replied Sharrkan, ""O my brother, this be no time for talk; this is the time for smiting with swords and shooting with shafts) so gird up your courage and hearten your hearts, for this strait is like a street with two gates; though, by the virtue of the Lord of Arabs and Ajams, were not the place so narrow I would bring them to naught, even though they were an hundred thousand men!"" Said Zau al-Makan, ""Had we wotted this we would have brought with us five thousand horse;"" and the Wazir Dandan continued, ""If we had ten thousand horse they had availed us naught in these narrows; but Allah will succour us against them. I know this defile and its straitness, and I know there be many places of refuge in it; for I have been here on razzia with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman, what while we besieged Constantinople. We abode in this place, and here is water colder than snow. So come, let us push out of this defile ere the Infidel host increase on us and get the start of us to the mountain top, whence they will hurl down rocks upon us, and we powerless to come at them."" So they began hurrying on to get out of those narrows; but the pious man, Zat al-Dawahi, looked at them and said, ""What is it ye fear, ye who have vowed yourselves to the Lord, and to working His will? By Allah, I abode imprisoned underground for fifteen years, yet never gainsaid the Almighty in aught he did with me! Fight ye in Allah's way; so whoever of you is slain Paradise shall be his abode, and whoso slayeth, his striving shall be to his honour."" When they heard from the ascetic these words, their care and anxiety ceased from them and they stood firm till the Infidels charged down from all sides, whilst the swords played upon their necks and the cup of death went round amongst them. The Moslems fought for the service of Allah a right good fight, and wrought upon His foes with sway of sword and lunge of lance; whilst Zau al-Makan smote upon the men and garred the knights bite the dust and their heads from their bodies take flight, five by five and ten by ten, till he had done to death a number of them past numbering and an accompt beyond counting. Now while so doing, he looked at the accursed old woman who was waving her sword and heartening them, and all who feared fled to her for shelter; but she was also signing the Infidels to slay Sharrkan. So troop after troop rushed on him with design to do him die; but each troop that charged, he charged and drove back; and when another troop attacked him he repelled the assault with the sword in their backs; for he thought it was the devotee's blessing that gave him the vic tory, and he said in himself, ""Verily on this holy men Allah looketh with eyes of His favour and strengtheneth my prowess against the Infidels with the purity of his pious intent: for I see that they fear me and cannot prevail against me, but every one who assaileth me turneth tail and taketh flight."" So they battled the rest of the day and, when night fell, the Moslems took refuge in a cave of that defile being weary with stress of war and cast of stone: and that day were slain of them five and forty. And when they were gathered together, they sought the devotee, but could find no trace of him; and this was grievous to them and they said, ""Belike, he hath died a martyr."" Quoth Sharrkan, ""I saw him heartening the horsemen with divine instances and using as talisman verses of Holy Writ."" Now while they were talking, behold, the accursed old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, stood before them, hending in hand the head of the Chief Captain of the ten thousand horse, a noble knight, a champion fierce in fight and a Satan for blight. One of the Turks had slain him with an arrow, and Allah hurried his soul to the fire; and when the Infidels saw what that Moslem had done with their leader, they all fell on him and wrought his bane and hewed him in pieces with their swords, and Allah hurried his soul to Heaven. Then the accursed old woman cut off that Knight's head and brought it and threw it at the feet of Sharrkan and Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan. Now when Sharrkan sew her, he sprang up hastily before her and exclaimed, ""Praised be Allah for thy safety and for our sighting thee, O holy man and devout champion of the Religion!"" Replied she, O my son, I have sought martyrdom this day, and have thrown my life away amid the Infidel array, but they feared me with dismay. When ye dispersed, I waxed jealous for your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight their leader, albeit he was a match for a thousand horse, and I smote him till I severed head from trunk. Not one of the Infidels could near me; so I brought his head to you,""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the Ninety-seventh Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the damned witch, Zat al-Dawahi, took the head of the Knight, the leader of the twenty thousand Infidels, she brought it and threw it down before Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan, saying, ""When I saw your condition, I waxed jealous for your honour; so I rushed on the Chief Knight and smote him with the sword till I severed head from trunk. And none could near me, so I brought his head to you, that you may be strengthened in Holy War and work out with your swords the will of the Lord of the Faithful. And now I purpose leaving you to strive against the Infidels, whilst I go to your army, though they be at the gates of Constantinople, and return with twenty thousand horse to destroy these Unfaithfuls."" Quoth Sharrkan, ""How wilt thou pass to them, O thou holy man, seeing that the valley is blocked up on all sides by the Miscreants?"" Quoth the accursed hag, ""Allah will veil me from their eyes and they shall not sight me; nor, if any saw me, would he dare to attack me at that time, for I shall be as one non existing, absorbed in Allah, and He will fend off from me His foes."" ""Thou sayest sooth, O holy man,"" rejoined Sharrkan, ""for indeed I have been witness of that; so, if thou can pass out at the first of the night, 'twill be best for us."" Replied she, ""I will set out at this very hour and, if thou desire, thou shalt go with me and none shall see thee. Furthermore if thy brother also have a mind to go with us we will take him, but none else; for the shadow of a saint can cover only twain."" Sharrkan said, ""As for me I will not leave my comrades; but, if my brother will, there is no harm in his going with thee and setting us free of this strait; for he is the stronghold of the Moslems and the sword of the Lord of the three Worlds; and if it be his pleasure, let him take with him the Wazir Dandan, or whom else he may elect and send us ten thousand horse to succour us against these caitiffs."" So after debate they agreed on this and the old woman said, ""Give me leisure to go before you and consider the condition of the Infidels, if they be asleep or awake."" Quoth they, ""We will not go forth save with thee and trust our affair to Allah."" ""If I do your bidding,"" replied she, ""blame me not but blame yourselves; for it is my rede that you await me till I bring you tidings of the case."" Then said Sharrkan, ""Go to them and delay not from us, for we shall be awaiting thee."" Thereupon she fared forth and Sharrkan turned to his brother addressing him and said, ""Were not this holy man a miracle worker, he had never slain yonder furious knight. This is proof sufficient of the ascetic's power; and of a truth the pride of the Infidels is laid low by the slaying of this cavalier, for he was violent, an evil devil and a stubborn."" Now whilst they were thus devising of the mighty works of the devotee, behold, the accursed Zat al-Dawahi came upon them and promised them victory over the Unbelievers; wherefor they thanked her (not knowing that all this was wile and guile) and the damned hag asked, ""Where be the King of the Age, Zau al-Makan, and the Minister Dandan?"" Answered he, ""Here am I!"" Take with thee thy Wazir,"" said she, ""and follow after me, that we may fare forth to Constantinople."" Now she had acquainted the Infidels with the cheat she had put upon the Moslems, and they rejoiced with exceeding great joy, and said, Our hearts will not be contented till we shall have slain their King in return for the Knight's death; because we had no stouter rider than he;"" and they added (bespeaking the ill omened hag as she told them her plan of faring to the land of the Moslems), ""When thou bringest him to us, we will bear him to King Afridun."" Then she went out and went out with her Zau al-Makan and the Minister Dandan, and she walked on before the two saying, ""Fare forth with the blessing of Almighty Allah!"" So they did her bidding, for the shaft of Pate and Fortune of man's lot had shot them, and she ceased not leading them both through the midst of the Grecian camp, till they came to the defile, the narrow pass aforesaid, whilst the Infidel enemy watched them, but did them no hindrance; for the infernal old woman had enjoined this. Now when Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan saw that the Infidel host offered them no let and stay and yet had them in sight, the Wazir exclaimed, ""By Allah, this is one of the holy man's saintly miracles! and doubtless he be of the elect."" Rejoined Zau al-Makan, ""By Allah, I think the Infidels be naught but blind, for we see them and they see us not."" And while they were thus praising the holy man and recounting his mighty works and his piety and his prayers, behold, the Infidels charged down on them from all sides and surrounded them and seized them, saying, ""Is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him too?"" And the Wazir Dandan replied, ""See you not yon other man that is before us? ' Replied the Unbelievers, ""By the truth of the Messiah and the Monks, and the Primate and the Metropolitan, we see none save you two!"" Then Zau Al-Makan said, ""By Allah, this is a chastisement decreed to us by Almighty Allah!""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Ninety-eighth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when the Unfaithful had seized upon King Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan, they said to the two, ""Is there anyone else with you twain, that we may seize upon him also?"" And the Wazir Dandan replied, ""See you not yon other man who be with us?"" They rejoined, ""By the truth of the Messiah and the Monks and the Primate and the Metropolitan, we see none save you two!"" Then the Infidels laid shackles on their feet and set men to guard them during the night, whilst Zat al-Dawahi fared on and disappeared from their sight. So they fell to lamenting and saying to each other, ""Verily, the opposing of pious men leadeth to greater distress than this, and we are punished by the strait which hath befallen us."" So far concerning Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan; but as regards King Sharrkan, he passed that night in the cavern with his comrades, and when dawned the day and he had prayed the morn prayer, he and his men made ready to do battle with the Infidel and he heartened them and promised them all good. Then they sallied out till they were hard upon the Unbelievers and, when these saw them from afar, they cried out to them, saying, ""O Moslems, we have taken captives your Sultan and your Wazir who hath the ordering of your affairs; and except ye leave off fighting us, we will slay you to the last man; but an you yield yourselves we will take you to our King, who will make peace with you on condition that you quit our country and return home and harm us in naught, and we will do you no harm in aught. If ye accept, it will be well for you; but if ye refuse there remaineth nothing for you but death. So we have told you sooth, and this is our last word to you."" Now when Sharrkan heard this and was certified of the captivity of his brother and the Wazir Dandan, he was weighed down with woe and wept; his force failed him and, making sure of death, he said to himself, ""Would I knew the cause of their capture! Did they fail of respect to the holy man or disobey him, or what was the matter?"" Then they sprang up to battle with the Unbelievers and slew great numbers of them. The brave was known that day from craven men, and sword and spear were dyed with bloody stain; for the Infidels flocked up on them, as flies flock to drink, from hill and from plain; but Sharrkan and his men ceased not to wage the fight of those who fear not to die, nor let death hinder them from the pursuit of victory, till the valley ran gore and earth was full of the slain she bore. And when night fell the armies separated each making for his own place; and the Moslems returned to the cavern where gain and loss were manifest to them: few remained of them and there was no dependence for them but on Allah and the scymitar. Now there had been slain of them that day five and thirty men of the chiefest Emirs, and they had killed thousands of the Infidels, footmen and fighters on horse. When Sharrkan saw this, the case was grievous to him and he asked his comrades ""What shall we do?""; whereto all answered, ""That which Almighty Allah willeth shall befal us."" On the morning of the second day, Sharrkan said to the remnant of his troop, ""If ye go forth to fight, not one of you will remain alive and we have but little left of food and water; so I deem ye would do better to bare your brands and go forth and stand at the mouth of this cavern, to hinder any from entering. Haply the holy man may have reached the Moslem host, and may return with ten thousand horses to succour us in fight with the Infidels, for belike the Unfaithful may have failed to see him and those with him."" They said, This were the better course to take, and of its expediency no doubt we make."" So the troop went out and held the cavern mouth standing by its walls; and every one of the Infidels who sought to enter in, they slew. Thus did they fend off the foe from the gape of the cave and they patiently supported all such assaults, till day was done and night came on dusky and dun;—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the Ninety-ninth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that the army of the Moslems held the cavern mouth and stood by its walls and they fended off the foe, and every one of the Infidels attempted to charge them, him they slew; and they patiently supported all such assaults till day was done and night came on dusky and dun, by which time King Sharrkan had only five and twenty men and no more left. Then quoth the Infidels to one another, ""When shall these battle days have an end? We are weary of warring the Moslems."" And quoth one of them, ""Up and at them, for there remain of them but five and twenty men! If we cannot prevail on them to fight, let us light a fire upon them; and if they submit themselves and yield to us, we will take them prisoners; but if they refuse we will leave them for fuel to the fire, so shall they become to men of foreseeing mind a warning dire. May the Messiah on their fathers have no grace, and may the sojourn of the Nazarenes be for them no abiding place!"" So they carried fuel to the jaws of the cavern and set fire to it. Thereupon Sharrkan and his companions made sure of perdition and yielded themselves prisoners. And while they were in this condition, lo! the knight their captain said to those who counselled their slaughter, ""It is not for any save for King Afridun to kill them, that he may gratify his wrath; therefore it behoveth us to keep them in durance by us till the morrow, when we will journey with them to Constantinople and deliver them to our King, who shall deal with them as he please."" Said they, ""This is the right course;"" and he commanded to pinion them and set guards over them. Then, as soon as it was black night, the Infidels busied themselves with feasting and making festival; and they called for wine and drank it till all fell upon their backs. Now Sharrkan and his brother, Zau al-Makan, were in confinement and so also were his companion knights; whereupon the elder turned to the younger brother and said to him, ""O my brother, how win free?"" ""By Allah,"" replied Zau al Makan, ""I know not; for here we be like birds in cage."" Then Sharrkan waxed wroth and sighed for excess of rage and stretched himself, till his pinion bonds brass asunder; whereupon being free he arose and went up to the Captain of the guard, and taking from his pocket the keys of the fetters, freed Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the rest of his men. Then he turned to the two and said, ""I desire to slay three of these Infidels and take and don their dress, we three; so that we shall be guised as Greeks and we will pass through them, with out their knowing us, and fare forth to our own force."" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""This is no safe counsel for if we kill them, I fear some of their comrades may hear their shrieks and the foe be aroused upon us and kill us. 'Twere the surer way to pass out of the defile."" So they agreed upon this and set out; and, when they had left the head of the strait a little distance behind, they saw horses picketed and the riders sleeping: and Sharrkan said to his brother, ""Better we take each one of us a steed."" There were five and twenty horsemen, so they took five and twenty horses, whilst Allah sent sleep upon the Infidels for a purpose He knew and the Faithful mounted and fared on till they were out of reach. Meanwhile Sharrkan set to gathering from the Infidels as many weapons, swords, and spears, as were wanted. And while they took saddle and struck forwards none of the Infidels supposed that anyone could release Zau al-Makan and his brother and their men; or that their prisoners had power to escape. Now when all the captives were safe from the Unfaithful, Sharrkan came up with his comrades, and found them awaiting his arrival, on coals of flame, expecting him in anxious grame, so he turned to them and said, ""Feel no fear since Allah protecteth us. I have that to propose which haply shall effect our purpose."" ""What is it?"" asked they and he answered, ""I desire that ye all climb to the mountain top and cry out with one voice, 'Allaho Akbar!' and ye add, 'The army of Al Islam is upon you! Allaho Akbar!' This wise their company will surely be dissolved nor will they find out the trick for they are drunk, but they will think that the Moslem troops have encompassed them about on all sides and have mingled with them; so they will fall on one another brand in hand during the confusion of drunkenness and sleep, and we will cleave them asunder with their own swords and the scymitar will go round amongst them till dawn."" Replied Zau al-Makan, ""This plan is not good; we should do better to make our way to our army and speak not a word; for if we cry out 'Allaho Akbar,' they will wake and fall on us and not one of us will escape."" Rejoined Sharrkan, ""By Allah, though they should awake tis no matter, and I long that ye fall in with my plan, for naught save good can come of it!"" So they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain and shouted, ""Allaho Akbar!"" And hills and trees and rocks reworded their Allaho Akbar for fear of the Almighty. But when the Kafirs heard this slogan they cried out to one another,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the One Hundredth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan spake thus, ""I long that ye fall in with this my plan, for naught save good can come of it."" So they agreed thereon and clomb the mountain head and shouted, ""Allaho Akbar!""; and hills and trees and rocks re worded their Allaho Akbar for fear of the Almighty. The Infidels heard it and cried out one to other and donned their armour and said, ""The foe is upon us, by the truth of the Messiah!"" Then they fell on one another and slew of their own men more than any knoweth save Almighty Allah. As soon as it was dawn, they sought for the captives, but found no trace of them, and their captains said, ""They who did this were the prisoners in our possession; up, then, and after them in all haste till ye overtake them, when we will make them quaff the cup of requital; and let not fright nor the panic of sudden awaking possess you."" So they took horse and rode after the fugitives and it wanted but an eye twinkling before they overtook them and surrounded them. Now when Zau al-Makan saw this, he was seized with increase of terror and said to his brother, ""What I feared would come, is come upon us, and now it remaineth only for us to fight for the Faith."" But Sharrkan preferred to hold his peace. Then Zau al- Makan and his companions rushed down from the hill crest, shouting, ""Allaho Akbar!"" and his men repeated the war cry and addressed themselves to fight and to sell their lives in the service of the Lord of Faithful Men; and while they were in this case, behold, they heard many voices voicing, ""There is no god but the God! God is most great! Salutation and salvation upon the Apostle, the Bringer of glad Tidings, the Bearer of bad Tidings!'' So they turned towards the direction of the sound and saw a company of Moslems who believed in one God, pushing towards them, whereat their hearts were heartened and Sharrkan charged upon the Infidels crying out, ""There is no god but the God! God is most great! he and those with him, so that earth quaked as with an earthquake and the Unbeliever host brake asunder and fled into the mountains and the Moslems followed them with lunge and blow; and Zau al-Makan and his comrades of the Moslems ceased not to smite the hosts of the Infidel foe, and parted heads from bodies till day darkened and night coming on starkened sight. Thereupon the Moslems drew together and passed the night in congratulations, and, when morning dawned and daybreak shone with its shine and sheen, they saw Bahram, the captain of the Daylamites, and Rustam, the captain of the Turks, advancing to join them, with twenty thousand cavaliers like lions grim. As soon as they saw Zau al-Makan, the riders dismounted and saluted him, and kissed ground between his hands when he said to them, ""Rejoice ye in the glad tidings of the victory of the Moslem and the discomfiture of the tribe of Unbelievers!"" Then they gave one another joy of their deliverance and of the greatness of their reward after Resurrection Day. Now the cause of the coming of the succours to that place was this. When the Emir Bahram and the Emir Rustam and the Chief Chamberlain, with the Moslem host and flags flaunting high ahead, came in sight of Constantinople they saw that the Nazarenes had mounted the walls and manned the towers and the forts, and had set all their defenders in order of defence, as soon as they learned of the approach of the host of Al-Islam and the banners Mohammedan, and they heard the clash of arms and the noise of war voices and tramp of horse hoofs and from their look outs they beheld the Moslems, with their standards and ensigns of the Faith of Unity under the dust clouds and lo! they were like a flight of locusts or rain clouds raining rain, and the voices of the Moslems chanting the Koran and glorifying the Compassionate One, struck their ears. Now the Infidels knew of the approach of this host through Zat al-Dawahi with her craft and whoredom, calumny and contrivance. And the armies of Al-Islam drew near, as it were the swollen sea, for the multitude of footmen and horsemen and women and children. Then quoth the General of the Turks to the General of the Daylamites, ""O Emir, of a truth, we are in jeopardy from the multitude of the foe who is on the walls. Look at yonder bulwarks and at this world of folk like the seas that clash with dashing billows. Indeed yon Infidel outnumbereth us an hundredfold and we cannot be safe from spies who may inform them that we are without a Sultan. In very sooth, we run danger from these enemies, whose numbers may not be told and whose resources none can withhold, especially in the absence of King Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the illustrious Wazir Dandan. If they know of this, they will be emboldened to attack us in their absence and with the sword they will annihilate us to the last man; not one of us safety shall see. So it is my counsel that thou take ten thousand riders of the allies and the Turks, and march them to the hermitage of Matruhina and the meadow of Malúkhiná in quest of our brothers and comrades. If thou act by my advice, it may be we shall approve ourselves the cause of their deliverance, in case they be hard pressed by the Infidels; and if thou act not, blame will not attach to me. But, an ye go, it behoveth that ye return quickly, for ill suspicion is part of prudence."" The Emir aforesaid fell in with his counsel; so they chose twenty thousand horse and they set out covering the roads and making for the monastery above mentioned. So much for the cause of their coming; but as regards the ancient dame, Zat al-Dawahi, as soon as she had delivered Sultan Zau al-Makan and his brother Sharrkan and the Wazir Dandan into the hands of the Infidels, the foul whore mounted a swift steed, saying to the Faithless, ""I design to rejoin the Moslem army which is at Constantinople and contrive for their destruction; for I will inform them that their chiefs are dead, and when they hear that from me, their joining will be disjointed and the cord of their confederation cut and their host scattered. Then will I go to King Afridun, Lord of Constantinople, and to my son Hardub, King of Roum, and relate to them their tidings and they will sally forth on the Moslems with their troops and will destroy them and will not leave one of them alive."" So she mounted and struck across country on her good steed all the livelong night; and, when day dawned, appeared the armies of Bahram and Rustam advancing towards her. So she turned into a wayside brake and hid her horse among the trees and she walked a while saying to herself, ""Haply the Moslem hosts be returning, routed, from the assault of Constantinople."" However, as she drew near them she looked narrowly and made sure that their standards were not reversed, and she knew that they were coming not as conquered men, but fearing for their King and comrades. When she was assured of this, she hastened towards them, running at speed, like a devil of ill rede, till reaching them she cried out, ""Haste ye! haste ye! O soldiers of the Compassionate One, hasten to the Holy War against the hosts of Satan!"" When Bahram saw her he dismounted and kissed the ground before her and asked her, ""O friend of Allah what is behind thee?"" Answered she, ""Question not of sad case and sore condition; for when our comrades had taken the treasure from the hermitage of Matruhina, and designed to win their way Constantinople wards, thereupon came out on them a driving host and a dreadful of the Infidels."" And the damned witch repeated to them the story to fill them with trouble and terror, adding, ""The most of them are dead, and there are but five and twenty men left."" Said Bahram, ""O holy man! when didst thou leave them?"" ""But this night,"" replied she. He cried, ""Glory be to Allah! to Him who hath rolled up the far distance for thee like a rug, so that thou hast sped thus walking upon thy feet and props upon a mid-rib of palm-tree! But thou art one of the saints which fly like birds when inspired and possessed by His directions."" Then he mounted his horse, and he was perplexed and confounded by what he had heard from the beldam so strong in lies and ill calumnies, and he said, ""There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Verily our labour is lost and our hearts are heavy within us, for our Sultan is a prisoner and those who are with him."" Then they cut across the country, wide and side, night and day, and when morning dawned they reached the head of the defile and saw Zau al-Makan and Sharrkan shouting. ""There is no god but the God! Allaho Akbar! and Salutation and Salvation upon the Congratulator, the Comminator."" Whereupon he and his drove at the Unbelievers and whelmed them, as the rain torrent whelms the waste; and cried out their war cries, till fear get hold of the prowess Knights and the mountains were cloven in affright. And when shone the day and showed its shine and sheen, the breeze of morning blew upon them sweet and fragrant, and each recognised other as hath been said before. Then they kissed the ground before the King and before his brother Sharrkan, who told them all that had befallen the party in the cave. Now thereat they marvelled and said to one another, ""Hasten we back to Constantinople, for we left our companions there, and our hearts are with them."" So they hurried departure, commending themselves to the Subtle, the All-wise, and Zau al-Makan exhorted the Moslems to steadfast- ness and versified in the following couplets,
""Be praises mine to all praiseworthy Thee, * O Lord, who stinted
            not mine aid to be!
Though was I lost abroad, Thou west to me * Strongest support
            which vouchsafed victory:
Thou gav'st me wealth and reign and goodly gifts, * And slungest
            con quering sword of valiancy:
Thou mad'st me blest beneath Thy kingly shade, * Engraced with
            generous boons dealt fain and free:
Thou savedst *from every fear I feared, by aid * Of my Wazir, the
            Age's noblest he!
Garred us Thy grace in fight to throw the Greek, * Who yet came
             back dight in War's cramoisie:
Then made I feint to fly from out the fight; * But like grim lion
           turning made them flee,
And left on valley sole my foemen, drunk * Not with old
           wine but Death-cup's revelry:
Then came the Saintly Hermit, and he showed * His marvels wrought
            for town and wold to see;
When slew they hero-wights who woke to dwell * In Eden bowers
           wherein sweet rill-lets well.""
But, when Zau al-Makan had made an end of versifying, his brother Sharrkan congratulated him on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the One Hundred and First Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that Sharrkan congratulated his brother, Zau al-Makan, on his safety and thanked him for the deeds he had done; after which both set out forcing their marches to rejoin their army. Such was their case; but as regards the old woman, Zat al-Dawahi, after she had foregathered with the hosts of Rustam and Bahram, she returned to the coppice, where she took her steed and mounted and sped on at speed, till she drew near the Moslem army that beleaguered Constantinople, when she lighted down from her destrier and led it to the pavilion tent of the Chief Chamberlain. And when he saw her, he stood up to her in honour and signed to her with his right hand and said, ""Welcome O pious recluse!"" Then he questioned her of what had befallen, and she repeated to him her disquieting lies and deluding calumnies, saying, ""In sooth I fear for the Emir Rustam, and the Emir Bahram, for that I met them and theirs on the way and sent them and their following to relieve the King and his companions. Now there are but twenty thousand horse and the Unbelievers outnumber them; so I would have thee at this moment send off the rest of thy troops at full speed to their suc cour, lest they be slain to the last man."" And she cried to them, ""Haste! Haste!"" When the Chamberlain and the Moslems heard these words, their spirits fell and they wept; but Zat al-Dawahi said to them, ""Ask aidance of Allah and bear patiently this triburation; for ye have the example of those who have been before you of the people of Mohammed; and Paradise with its palaces is laid out by Allah for those who die martyrs; and needs must all die, but most praiseworthy is dying while fighting for the Faith."" The Chamberlain, hearing this speech of the accursed old woman, called for the Emir Bahram's brother, a knight by name Tarkash; and, choosing out for him ten thousand horse, riders famed for force, bade him set out at once. So he fared forth and marched all that day and the whole of the next night, till he neared the Moslems. When daylight dawned, Sharrkan saw the dust cloud about them and feared for the men of Al-Islam and said, ""If these troops which are coming upon us be Moslem men our victory is assured by them; but, if these be Nazarenes, there is no gainsaying Destiny's decrees."" Then he turned to his brother, Zau al- Makan, and said, Never fear, for with my life I will ransom thee from death. If these be Mohammedan troops, then were it an increase of heavenly favours; but, if they be our foes, there is no help save that we fight them. Yet do I long to meet the Holy Man ere I die, so I may beg him to pray that I die not save by death of martyrdom."" Whilst the twain were thus speaking, behold, there appeared the banners inscribed with the words, ""There is no god but the God and Mohammed is the Apostle of God;"" and Sharrkan cried out, ""How is it with the Moslems?"" ""All are sound and safe,"" replied they, ""and we came not but out of concern for you."" Then the Chief of the army dismounted and, kissing ground before Sharrkan, asked, ""O my lord, how be the Sultan and the Wazir Dandan and Rustam and my brother Bahram; are they all in safety?"" He answered, ""All well; but who brought thee tidings of us?"" Quoth Tarkash; ""It was the Holy Man who told us that he had met my brother Bahram and Rustam and had sent them both to you and he also assured us that the Infidels had encompassed you and out numbered you; but I see not the case save the contrary thereof and that you are victorious."" They questioned him, ""And how did the Holy Man reach you?""; and he replied, ""Walking on his feet and he had compassed in a day and a night, ten days' journey for a well girt horseman."" ""There is no doubt but that he is a Saint of Allah,"" said Sharrkan, ""but where is he now?"" They rejoined, ""We left him with our troops, the folk of the Faith, moving them to do battle with the rebels and the Faithless."" Thereat Sharrkan rejoiced and all thanked Allah for their own deliverance and the safety of the Holy Man; and commended the dead to His mercy saying, ""This was writ in the Book."" Then they set out making for Constantinople by forced marches, and whilst they were on this enterprise, behold, a dust cloud arose to such height that it walled the two horizons, the eastern and the western, from man's sight and the day was darkened by it to night. But Sharrkan looked at it and said, ""Verily, I fear lest this be the Infidels who have routed the army of Al-Islam for that this dust walleth the world, east and west, and hideth the two horizons, north and south."" Presently appeared under the dust a pillar of darkness, blacker than the blackness of dismal days; nor ceased to come upon them that column more dreadful than the dread of the Day of Doom. Horse and foot hastened up to look at it and know the terrors of the case, when behold, they saw it to be the recluse aforesaid; so they thronged round him to kiss his hands and he cried out, ""O people of the Best of Mankind, the lamp which shineth in darkness blind, verily the Infidels have outwitted the Moslems by guile, for they fell upon the host of the One God whilst they deemed themselves safe from the Faithless, and attacked them in their tents and made a sore slaughter of them what while they looked for no wile; so hasten to the aid of the Believers in the unity of God, and deliver them from those who deny Him!"" Now when Sharrkan heard these words, his heart flew from his breast with sore trouble; and, alighting from his steed in amazement, he kissed the Recluse's hands and feet. On like wise did his brother, Zau al-Makan, and the rest of the foot and horse troops; except the Wazir Dandan, who dismounted not but said, ""By Allah, my heart flieth from this devotee, for I never knew show of devotion to religion that bred not bane. So leave him and rejoin your comrades the Moslems, for this man is of the outcasts from the gate of the mercy of the Lord of the Three Worlds! How often have I here made razzias with King Omar bin al-Nu'uman and trodden the earth of these lands!"" Said Sharrkan, ""Put away from thee such evil thought, hast thou not seen this Holy Man exciting the Faithful to fight, and holding spears and swords light? So slander him not, for backbiting is blameable and poisoned is the flesh of the pious. Look how he inciteth us to fight the foe; and, did not Almighty Allah love him, He had cast him aforetime into fearful torment."" Then Sharrkan bade bring a Nubian mule for the ascetic to ride and said, ""Mount, O pious man, devout and virtuous!"" But the devotee refused to ride and feigned self denial, that he might attain his end; and they knew not that this holy personage was like him of whom the poet saith,
""He prayeth and he fasteth for an end he doth espy; * When once his end is safely won then fast and prayer good bye.""
So the devotee ceased not to walk among the horsemen and the footmen, like a wily fox meditating guile, and began to uplift her voice, chanting the Koran and praising the Compassionate One. And they continued pressing forward till they approached the camp of Al-Islam, where Sharrkan found the Moslem in conquered plight and the Chamberlain upon the brink of falling back in flight, whilst the sword of Greece havoc dight among the Faithful, the righteous and those who work upright,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the One Hundred and Second Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Sharrkan saw the Moslems in conquered plight and the Chamberlain upon the brink of retreat and flight and the sword havoc dight among the righteous and the workers of upright, the cause of this weakness among the Moslems was that the accursed old woman, Zat al- Dawahi, the foe of the Faith, after seeing that Bahram and Rustam had set forward with their troops to join Sharrkan and his brother Zau al-Makan, repaired to the camp of the Mahometans before Constantinople and caused the mission of the Emir Tarkash, as hath been before said. In this her purpose was to divide the Moslem forces the better to weaken them. Then she left them and entered Constantinople, and called with a loud voice on the knights of the Greeks, saying, ""Let me down a cord that I may tie thereto this letter, and do ye bear it to your King Afridun, that he may read it and to my son King Hardub that they both do what is written therein of bidding and forbidding."" So they let down for her a string and she tied thereto a letter whose purport was the following: ""From the terriblest of tribulations and the chiefest of all calamities, Zat al-Dawahi, to King Afridun greeting. But afterwards, of a truth I have contrived a device for destroying the Moslems; so bide ye quiet and content. I have cozened and captured their Sultan and the Wazir Dandan; and then I returned to their camp and acquainted them therewith, whereby their pride had a fall and their withers were wrung. And I have so wrought upon the host 'leaguering Constantinople that they have sent ten thousand men under the Emir Tarkash to succour the capitves, of whom there be now left but few; it is therefore my object that ye sally forth against them with all your power while this day endureth; and that ye fall on them in their tents and that ye leave them not till ye shall have slain them to the last man; for, verily the Messiah looketh down upon you and the Blessed Virgin favoureth you; and I hope of the Messiah that he forget not what deed I have done."" When her letter came to King Afridun, he rejoiced with great joyance; and, sending at once for King Hardub of Greece, son of Zat al-Dawahi, read the letter to him as soon as he came,whereathe was exceeding glad and said, ""See my mother's craft; verily it dispenseth with swords, and her aspect standeth in stead of the terrors of the Day of Dread."" Rejoined Afridun, ""May the Messiah not bereave us of thy venerable parent nor deprive her of her wile and guile!"" Then he bade the Knights give orders for sallying outside the city, and the news was noised abroad in Constantinople. So the Nazarenes and the cohorts of the Cross burst forth and unsheathed their keen sabres in their numbers, shouting out their professions of impiety and heresies, and blaspheming the Lord of all Creatures. When the Chamberlain saw the sally, he said, ""Behold, the Greek is upon us and they surely have learned that our Sultan is far away; and haply they have attacked us, for that the most part of our troops have marched to the succour of King Zau al-Makan!"" Therewith he waxed wroth and cried out, ""Ho, soldiers of Al-Islam and favourers of the True Faith, an you flee you are lost, but if ye stand fast, ye win! Know ye that valiancy lieth in endurance of outrance and that no case is so strait but that the Almighty is able to make it straight; Allah assain you and look upon you with eyes of compassion fain!"" Thereupon the Moslems cried out, ""Allaho Akbar!"" and the believer in the One God shouted his slogan, and whirled the mill wheels of fight with cutting and thrusting in main and might; scymitars and spears played sore and the plains and valleys were swamped with gore. The priests and monks priested it, tight girding their girdles and uplifting the Crucifixes, while the Moslem shouted out the professions of the Requiting King and verses of the Koran began to sing. The hosts of the Compassion are One fought against the legions of Satan; and head flew from body of man, while the good Angels hovered above the people of the Chosen Prophet, nor did the sword cease to smite till the day darkened and night came on and starkened. Now the miscreants had encompassed the Moslems and made sure of escaping the pains that awaited them; and the Faithless greeded for victory over the Faithful until day dawned and dazzled. There upon the Chamberlain mounted, he and his men, trusting thee Allah would help them to victory; and host was mingled with host and battle rose a foot and took post. And heads flew from trunks whilst the brave stood fast in stead; the craven turned tail and fled; and the Judge of death judged and sentence sped, so that the champions fell from their saddles slain and corpses cumbered meadow and plain. Then the Moslem began to give ground and rearwards bent; and the Greek took possession of some of their tents; whereupon the Moslems were about to break and retreat and take flight, when meanwhile behold, up came Sharrkan with the rest of the host of Al-Islam and the standards of the Believers in Unity. And having come up with them, he charged the Infidels; and followed him Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the Emirs Bahram and Rustam with his brother Tarkash. When the foe saw this, they lost head and their reason fled, and the dust clouds towered till they covered the country whilst the righteous Believers joined their pious comrades. Then Sharrkan accosted the Chamberlain and praised him for his steadfastness; and he in turn gave the Prince joy of his timely succour and his gaining the day. Thereat the Moslems were glad and their hearts were heartened; so they rushed upon their enemies and devoted themselves to Allah in their Fight for the Faith. But when the Idolaters beheld the standards Mohammedan and there on the profession of Faith Islamitan, proclaiming the Unity, they shrieked ""Woe!"" and ""Ruin!"" and besought succour of the Patriarchs of the Monasteries. Then fell they to calling upon John and Mary and the Cross abhorrent and stayed their hands from slaughter, whilst King Afridun went up to consult King Hardub of Greece, for the two Kings stood one at the head of each wing, right and left. Now there was with them also a famous cavalier, Lawiya highs, who commanded the centre; and they drew out in battle array, but indeed they were full of alarm and affray. Meanwhile, the Moslems aligned their forces and thereupon Sharrkan came to his brother, Zau al-Makan, and said, ""O King of the Age, doubtless they mean to champion it, and that is also the object of our desire; but it is my wish to push forward the stoutest hearted of our fighters, for by forethought is one half of life wrought."" Replied the Sultan, ""As thou wilt, O companion of good counsel!"" ""It is my wish,"" added Sharrkan, ""to stand in mid line opposite the Infidel, with the Wazir Dandan on my left and thee on my right, whilst the Emir Bahram leads the dexter wing and the Emir Rustam leads the wing sinistral; and thou, O mighty King, shalt be under the standards and the ensigns, for that thou art the pillar of our defence; upon thee, after Allah, is our dependence and we will all be thy ransom from aught that can harm thee."" Zau al-Makan thanked him therefor, and the slogan arose and the sabre was drawn; but, as things stood thus, behold, there came forth a cavalier from the ranks of Roum; and, as he drew near, they saw that he was mounted on a slow paced she mule, fleeing with her master from the shock of swords. Her housings were of white silk covered by a prayer-carpet of Cash mere stuff, and on her back sat a Shaykh, an old man of comely presence and reverend aspect, garbed in a gown of white wool. He stinted not pushing her and hurrying her on till he came near the Moslem and said, ""I am an ambassador to you all, and an ambassador hath naught to do save to deliver; so give me safe conduct and permit of speech, that I communicate to you my message."" Replied Sharrkan, ""Thou art in safety: fear neither sway of sword nor lunge of lance."" Thereupon the old man dismounted and, taking the Cross from his neck, placed it before the Sultan and humbled himself with much humility. Then quoth to him the Moslems, ""What is with thee of news?""; and quoth he, ""I am an ambassador from King Afridun, for I counselled him to avert the destruction of all these frames of men and temples of the Compassionate One; and to him it seemed righteous to stay the shedding of blood and limit it to the encounter of two knights in shock of fight singular; so he agreed to that and he saith to you, 'Verily, I will ransom my army with my life; so let the Moslem King do as I do and with his life ransom his host. And if he kill me, there will be no stay left in the army of Roum, and if I kill him, there will be no stability with the Moslems."" When Sharrkan heard this he said, ""O monk, I agree to that, for it is just nor may it be gainsaid; and behold, I will meet him in duello and do with him derring do, for I am Champion of the Faithful even as he is Champion of the Faithless; and if he slay me, he will have won the day and naught will remain for the Moslems forces save flight. So return to him, O thou monk, and say that the single combat shall take place to morrow, for this day we have come off our journey and are aweary; but after rest neither reproach nor blame fear ye."" So the monk returned (and he rejoicing) to King Afridun and King Hardub, and told them both what Sharrkan had said, whereat King Afridun was glad with exceeding gladness and fell from him anxiety and sadness, and he said to himself, ""No doubt but this Sharrkan is their doughtiest swayer of the sword and the dourest at lunge of lance; and when I shall have slain him, their hearts will be disheartened and their strength will be shattered."" Now Zat al-Dawahi had written to King Afridun of that and had told him how Sharrkan was a Knight of the Braves and the bravest of knights and had warned him against him; but Afridun was a stalwart cavalier who fought in many a fashion; he could hurl rocks and throw spears and smite with the iron mace and he feared not the prowess of the prow. So when he heard the report of the monk that Sharrkan agreed to the duello, he was like to fly for exceeding joy because he had self confidence and he knew that none could with stand him. The Infidels passed that night in joy and jubilee and wine bibbing; and, as soon as it was dawn, the two armies drew out with the swart of spear and the blanch of blade. And behold a cavalier rode single handed into the plain, mounted on a steed of purest strain, and for foray and fray full ready and fain. And that Knight had limbs of might and he was clad in an iron cuirass made for stress of fight. On his breast he wore a jewelled mirror and in his hand he bore a keen scymitar and his lance of Khalanj wood, the curious work of the Frank, weighing a quintal. Then the rider uncovered his face and cried out, saying, ""Whoso knoweth me verily hath enough of me, and whoso knoweth me not right soon shall ken who I be. I am Afridun the overwhelmed by the well omened Shawáhi, Zat al-Dawahi."" But he had not ended speaking ere Sharrkan, the Champion of the Moslems, fared forth to meet him, mounted on a sorrel horse worth a thousand pieces of red gold with accoutrements purfled in pearls and precious stone; and he bore in baldrick a blade of watered Indian steel that through necks shore and made easy the hard and sore. He crave his charger between the two hosts in line whilst the horsemen all fixed on him their eyne, and he cried out to Afridun, ""Woe to thee, O accursed! dost thou deem me one of the horsemen thou hast overta'en who cannot stand against thee on battle plain?"" Then each rushed upon other and they bashed together like two mountains crashing or two billows dash ing and clashing: they advanced and retreated; and drew together and withdrew; and stinted not of fray and fight and weapon play, and strife and stay, with stroke of sword and lunge of lance. Of the two armies looking on, some said, ""Sharrkan is victor!"" and others, ""Afridun will conquer!""; and the two riders stayed not their hands from the hustle until ceased the clamour and the bustle; and the dust columns rose and the day waned and the sun waxed yellow and wan. Then cried out King Afridun to Sharrkan, saying, ""By the truth of the Messiah and the Faith which is no liar, thou art nought save a doughty rider and a stalwart fighter; but thou art fraudful and thy nature is not that of the noble. I ken thy work is other than praiseworthy nor is thy prowess that of a Prince; for thy people behave to thee as though thou wert a slave; and see! they bring thee out a charger which is not thine, that thou mayst mount and return to the fight. But by the truth of my Faith, thy fighting irketh and fatigueth me and I am weary of cutting and thrusting with thee; and if thou purpose to lay on load with me to night, thou wouldst not change aught of thy harness nor thy horse, till thou approve to the cavaliers, thy generous blood and skill in brunt."" When Sharrkan heard him say these words concerning his own folk behaving to him though he were a slave, he waxt wroth and turned towards his men, meaning to sign to them and bid them not prepare him change of harness or horse, when lo! Afridun shook his throw spear high in air and cast it at Sharrkan. Now when the Moslem turned his back, he found none of the men near him, and he knew this to be a trick of the accursed Infidel; so he wheeled round in haste and behold, the javelin came at him, so he swerved from it, till his head was bent low as his saddle bow. The weapon grazed his breast, and pierced the skin of his chest, for Sharrkan was high bosomed: whereupon he gave one cry and swooned away. Thereat the accursed Afridun was joyful, thinking he had slain him; and shouted to the Infidels bidding them rejoice, whereat the Faithless were encouraged and the Faithful wept. When Zau al-Makan saw his brother reeling in selle so that he well nigh fell, he despatched cavaliers towards him and the braves hurried to his aid and came up with him. Thereupon the Infidels drove at the Moslems; the two hosts joined battle and the two lines were mingled, whilst the keen scymitar of Al-Yaman did good work. Now the first to reach Sharrkan was the Wazir Dandan,—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the One Hundred and Third Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Zau al-Makan saw that the accursed Infidel had struck with javelin his brother Sharrkan, he deemed him dead, and despatched cavaliers towards him; and the first to reach him were the Wazir Dandan and the Emir of the Turks, Bahram, and the Emir of the Daylamites, Rustam. They found him falling from his horse; so they stayed him in his saddle and returned with him to his brother, Zau al-Makan; then they gave him in charge to his pages, and went again to do the work of cut and thrust. So the strife redoubled and the weapons together clashed and ceased not bate and debate and naught was to be seen but blood flowing and necks bowing; nor did the swords cease on the napes of men to make play nor the strife to rage with more and more affray, till the most part of the night was past away and the two hosts were aweary of the mellay. So they called a truce and each army returned to its tents, whilst all the Infidels repaired to King Afridun and kissed the ground before him, and the priests and monks wished him joy of his victory over Sharrkan. Then the King fared for Constantinople and sat upon the throne of his realm, when King Hardub came to him and said, ""May the Messiah strengthen thy fore arm and never cease to be thy helper and hearken to what prayers my pious mother, Zat al-Dawahi, shall pray for thee! Know that the Moslems can make no stay without Sharrkan."" Replied Afridun, ""To morrow shall end the affair when to fight I fare: I will seek Zau al-Makan and slay him, and their army shall turn tail and of flight shall avail."" Such was the case with the Kafirs; but as regards the host of Al-Islam, when Zau al-Makan returned to his tent, he thought of naught but his brother and, going into the pavilion, found him in evil case and sore condition; whereupon he summoned for counsel the Wazir Dandan and Rustam and Bahram. When they entered, they opined to assemble the physicians that they might medicine Sharrkan, and they wept and said, ""The world will not readily afford his like!"" and they watched by him all that night, and about the later hours came to them the Recluse in tears. When Zau al-Makan saw him, he rose in honour; and the Religious stroked Sharrkan's wound with his hand, chanting somewhat of the Koran and repeating by way of talisman some of the verses of the Compassionate One. And the pretender ceased not to watch over him till dawn, when he came to himself and, opening his eyes, moved his tongue in his mouth and spake. At this Zau al-Makan rejoiced, saying, ""Of a truth the blessing of the Holy Man hath taken effect on him!"" And Sharrkan said, ""Praised be Allah for recovery; indeed, I am well at this hour. That accursed one played me false; and, but that I swerved aside lighter than lightening, the throw spear had pierced through my breast. So praised be Allah for saving me! And how is it with the Moslems?"" Answered Zau al-Makan, ""All are weeping for thee."" Quoth Sharrkan, ""I am well and in good case; but where is the Holy Man?"" Now he was sitting by him and said, ""At thy head."" So the Prince turned to him and kissed his hand when he said, ""O my son! Be of good patience and Allah shall increase thy reward; for the wage is measured by the work."" Sharrkan rejoined, ""Pray for me,"" and he prayed for him. As soon as morning dawned and day brake in shine and sheen, the Moslems sallied out to the plain and the Kafirs made ready to thrust and cut. Then the Islamite host advanced and offered fight with weapons ready dight, and King Zau al-Makan and Afridun made to charge one at other. But when Zau al-Makan fared forth into the field, there came with him the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Bahram, saying, ""We will be thy sacrifice."" He replied, ""By the Holy House and Zemzem and the Place! I will not be stayed from going forth against these wild asses."" And when he rode out into the field he played with sword and spear till riders marvelled and both armies wondered; then he rushed upon the foe's right wing and of it slew two knights and in like manner he dealt with the left wing. Presently he stayed his steed in the midst of the field and cried out, ""Where is Afridun, that I may make him taste the cup of disgrace?"" But when King Hardub saw the case he conjured Afridun not to attack him, saying, ""O King, yesterday it was thy turn to fight: it is mine to day. I care naught for his prowess."" So he rushed out towards Zau al-Makan brand in hand and under him a stallion like Abjar, which was Antar's charger and its coat was jet black even as saith the poet,
""On the glancing racer outracing glance * He speeds, as though he
            would collar Doom:
His steed's black coat is of darkest jet, * And likest Night in
            her nightliest gloom:
Whose neigh sounds glad to the hearer's ears * Like thunders
             rolling in thun d'rous boom:
If he race the wind he will lead the way, * And the lightning
             flash will behind him loom.''
Then each rushed upon the opponent, parrying blows and proving the marvellous qualities were stored in him; and they fell to drawing on and withdrawing till the breasts of the bystanders were straitened and they were weary of waiting for the event. At last Zau al-Makan cried out his war cry and rushed upon Hardub, King of Cæsarea, and struck him a stroke that shore head from trunk and slew him on the spot. When the Infidels saw this, they charged in a body, compact and united, upon Zau al-Makan, who met them amidfield, and they engaged in hewing and foining, till blood ran in rills. Then the Moslems cried out, ""Allaho Akbar!"" (God is most Great) and ""There is no god but the God!"", and invoked salvation for the Prophet, the Bringer of Glad Tidings, the Bearer of Bad Tidings. And there befel a great fight, but Allah assigned victory to the Faithful and defeat to the Faithless. The Wazir Dandan shouted, ""Take your blood revenge for King Omar bin al Nu'uman and his son Sharrkan!""; and bared his head and cried out to the Turks. Now there were by his side more than twenty thousand horse, and all charged with him as men, when the Faithless found naught to save their lives but flight. So they turned tail to fly while the biting sabre wrought its havoc and the Moslems slew of them that day some fifty thousand horse and took more than that number: much folk also were slain while going in at the gates, for the flock was great. Then the Greeks hove to the doors and swarmed up the walls to await the assault; and in fine the Moslem hosts returned to their tents aided to glory and victory, and King Zau al-Makan went in to his brother whom he found in most joyous case. So he made a prostration of thanks to the Bountiful and the Exalted; and then he came forward and gave Sharrkan joy of his recovery. Answered he, ""Verily we are all under the benediction of this Religious, holy and righteous, nor would you have been victorious, but for his accepted orisons; indeed all day he remained at prayer to invoke victory on the Moslems.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the One Hundred and Fourth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when Zau al- Makan went in to his brother Sharrkan, he found him sitting with the Holy Man by his side; so he rejoiced and drew near him and gave him joy of his recovery. Answered he, ""Verily we are all under the benediction of this Recluse nor would you have been victorious but for his prayers, indeed he felt no fear this day and he ceased not supplication for the Moslems. I found strength return to me, when I heard your 'Allaho Akbar,' for then I knew you to be victorious over your enemies. But now recount to me, O my brother, what befel thee."" So he told him all that had passed between him and the accursed Hardub and related how he had slain him and sent him to the malediction of Allah; and Sharrkan praised him and thanked him for his prowess. When Zat al-Dawahi heard tell of her son's death (and she still drest as a devotee), her face waxed yellow and her eyes ran over with railing tears: she kept her counsel, however, and feigned to the Moslems that she was glad and wept for excess of joy. But she said to herself, ""By the truth of the Messiah, there remaineth no profit of my life, if I burn not his heart for his brother, Sharrkan, even as he hath burned my heart for King Hardub, the mainstay of Christendom and the hosts of Crossdom!"" Still she kept her secret. And the Wazir Dandan and King Zau al-Makan and the Chamberlain remained sitting with Sharrkan till they had dressed and salved his wound; after which they gave him medicines and he began to recover strength; whereat they joyed with exceeding joy and told the troops who congratulated themselves, saying, ""To morrow he will ride with us and do manly devoir in the siege."" Then said Sharrkan to them, ""Ye have fought through all this day and are aweary of fight; so it behoveth that you return to your places and sleep and not sit up."" They accepted his counsel and then each went away to his own pavilion, and none remained with Sharrkan but a few servants and the old woman Zat al-Dawahi. He talked with her through part of the night, then he stretched himself to rest: and his servants did likewise and presently sleep overcame them all and they lay like the dead. Such was the case with Sharrkan and his men; but as regards the old woman she alone abode awake while they slumbered in the tent and, looking at Sharrkan she presently saw that he was drowned in sleep. Thereupon she sprang to her feet, as she were a scald she bear or a speckled snake, and drew from her waist cloth a dagger so poisoned that if laid thereon it would have melted a rock. Then she unsheathed the poniard and went up to Sharrkan's head and she drew the knife across his throat and severed his weasand and hewed off his head from his body. And once more she sprang to her feet; and, going the round of the sleeping servants, she cut off their heads also, lest they should awake. Then she left the tent and made for the Sultan's pavilion, but finding the guards on the alert, turned to that of the Wazir Dandan. Now she found him reading the Koran and when his sight fell upon her he said, ""Welcome to the Holy Man!"" Hearing this from the Wazir, her heart trembled and she said, ""The reason of my coming hither at this time is that I heard the voice of a saint amongst Allah's Saints and am going to him."" Then she turned her back, but the Wazir said to himself, ""By Allah, I will follow our Devotee this night!"" So he rose and walked after her; but when the accursed old woman sensed his footsteps, she knew that he was following her: wherefore she feared the disgrace of discovery and said in herself, ""Unless I serve some trick upon him he will disgrace me."" So she turned and said to him from afar, ""Ho, thou Wazir, I am going in search of this Saint that I may learn who he is; and, after learning this much, I will ask his leave for thee to visit him. Then I will come back and tell thee: for I fear thine accompanying me, without having his permission, lest he take umbrage at me seeing thee in my society."" Now when the Wazir heard these words, he was ashamed to answer her; so he left her and returned to his tent, and would have slept; but sleep was not favourable to him and the world seemed heaped upon him. Presently he rose and went forth from the tent saying in himself, ""I will go to Sharrkan and chat with him till morning."" But when he entered into Sharrkan's pavilion, he found the blood running like an aqueduct and saw the servants lying with their throats cut like beasts for food. At this he cried a cry which aroused all who were asleep; the folk hastened to him and, seeing the blood streaming, set up a clamour of weeping and wailing. Then the noise awoke the Sultan, who enquired what was the matter, and it was said to him, ""Sharrkan thy brother and his servants are murthered."" So he rose in haste and entered the tent, and found the Wazir Dandan shrieking aloud and he saw his brother's body without a head. Thereat he swooned away and all the troops crowded around him, weeping and crying out, and so remained for a while, till he came to himself, when he looked at Sharrkan and wept with sore weeping, while the Wazir and Rustam and Bahram did the like. But the Chamberlain cried and lamented more than the rest and asked leave to absent himself, such was his alarm. Then said Zau al-Makan, ""Know ye who did this deed and how is it I see not the Devotee, him who the things of this world hath put away?"" Quoth the Wazir, ""And who should have been the cause of this affliction, save that Devotee, that Satan? By Allah, my heart abhorred him from the first, because I know that all who pretend to be absorbed in practices religious are vile and treacherous!"" And he repeated to the King the tale of how he would have followed the Religious, but he forbade him, whereupon the folk broke out into a tumult of weeping and lamentation and humbled themselves before Him who is ever near, Him who ever answereth prayer, supplicating that He would cause the false Devotee who denied Allah's testimony to fall into their hands. Then they laid Sharrken out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues.—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the One Hundred and Fifth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that they laid Sharrkan out and buried him in the mountain aforesaid and mourned over his far-famed virtues. Then they looked for the opening of the city gate; but it opened not and no sign of men appeared to them on the walls; whereat they wondered with exceeding wonder. But King Zau al-Makan said, ""By Allah, I will not turn back from them, though I sit here for years and years, till I take blood revenge for my brother Sharrkan and waste Constantinople and kill the King of the Nazarenes, even if death overcome me and I be at rest from this woeful world!"" Then he bade be brought out the treasure taken from the Monastery of Matruhina; and mustered the troops and divided the monies among them, and he left not one of them but he gave him gifts which contented him. Moreover, he assembled in the presence three hundred horse of every division and said to them, ""Do ye send supplies to your households, for I am resolved to abide by this city, year after year, till I have taken man bote for my brother Sharrkan, even if I die in this stead."" And when the army heard these words and had received his gifts of money they replied, ""To hear is to obey!"" Thereupon he summoned couriers and gave them letters and charged them to deliver the same, together with the monies, to the soldiers' families and inform them that all were safe and satisfied, and acquaint them saying, ""We are encamped before Constantinople and we will either destroy it or die; and, albeit we be obliged to abide here months and years, we will not depart hence till we take it."" Moreover, he bade the Wazir Dandan write to his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, and said to him, ""Acquaint her with what hath befallen us, and what be our situation and commend my child to her care since that, when I went out to war, my wife was near her delivery and by this time she must needs have been brought to bed; and if she hath given birth to a boy, as I have heard say, hasten your return and bring me the acceptable news."" Then he gave them somewhat of money, which they pouched and set out at once; and all the people flocked forth to take leave of them and entrust them with the monies and the messages. After they had departed, Zau al-Makan turned to the Wazir Dandan and commanded him to advance with the army against the city walls. So the troops pushed forward, but found none on the ramparts, whereat they marvelled, while Zau al-Makan was troubled at the case, for he deeply mourned the severance from his brother Sharrkan and he was sore perturbed about that traitor the Ascetic. In this condition they abode three days without seeing anyone. So far concerning the Moslems; but as regards the Greeks and the cause of their refusing to fight during these three days the case was this. As soon as Zat al-Dawahi had slain Sharrkan, she hastened her march and reached the walls of Constantinople, where she called out in the Greek tongue to the guards to throw her down a rope. Quoth they, ""Who art thou?""; and quoth she, ""I am Zat al- Dawahi."" They knew her and let down a cord to which she tied herself and they drew her up; and, when inside the city, she went in to the King Afridun and said to him, ""What is this I hear from the Moslems? They say that my son King Hardub is slain."" He answered, ""Yes;"" and she shrieked out and wept right grievously and ceased not weeping thus till she made Afridun and all who were present weep with her. Then she told the King how she had slain Sharrkan and thirty of his servants, whereat he rejoiced and thanked her; and, kissing her hands, exhorted her to resignation for the loss of her son. Said she, ""By the truth of the Messiah, I will not rest content with killing that dog of the Moslem dogs in blood revenge for my son, a King of the Kings of the age! Now there is no help for it but that I work some guile and I contrive a wile whereby to slay the Sultan Zau al-Makan and the Wazir Dandan and the Chamberlain and Rustam and Bahram and ten thousand cavaliers of the army of Al-Islam; for it shall never be said that my son's head be paid with the bloodwit of Sharrkan's head; no, never!"" Then said she to King Afridun, ""Know, O King of the Age, that it is my wish to set forth mourning for my son and to cut my Girdle and to break the Crosses."" Replied Afridun, ""Do what thou desire; I will not gainsay thee in aught. And if thou prolong thy mourning for many days it were a little thing; for though the Moslems resolve to beleaguer us years and years, they will never win their will of us nor gain aught of us save trouble and weariness."" Then the Accursed One (when she had ended with the calamity she had wrought and the ignominies which in herself she had thought) took ink case and paper and wrote thereon: ""From Shawahi, Zat al- Dawahi, to the host of the Moslems. Know ye that I entered your country and duped by my cunning your nobles and at first hand I slew your King Omar bin al-Nu'uman in the midst of his palace. Moreover, I slew, in the affair of the mountain pass and of the cave, many of your men; and the last I killed were Sharrkan and his servants. And if fortune do not stay me and Satan obey me, I needs must slay me your Sultan and the Wazir Dandan, for I am she who came to you in disguise of a Recluse and who heaped upon you my devices and deceits. Wherefore, an you would be in safety after this, fare ye forth at once; and if you seek your own destruction cease not abiding for the nonce; and though ye tarry here years and years, ye shall not do your desire on us. And so peace be yours!"" After writing her writ she devoted three days to mourning for King Hardub; arid, on the fourth, she called a Knight and bade him take the letter and make it fast to a shaft and shoot it into the Moslem camp. When this was done, she entered the church and gave herself up to weeping and wailing for the loss of her son, saying to him who took the kingship after him, ""Nothing will serve me but I must kill Zau al-Makan and all the nobles of Al-Islam."" Such was the case with her; but as regards what occurred to the Moslems, all passed three days in trouble and anxiety, and on the fourth when gazing at the walls behold, they saw a knight holding a bow and about to shoot an arrow along whose side a letter was bound. So they waited till he had shot it among them and the Sultan bade the Wazir Dandan take the missive and read it. He perused it accordingly; and, when Zau al-Makan heard it to end and understood its purport, his eyes filled with tears and he shrieked for agony at her perfidy; and the Minister Dandan said, ""By Allah, my heart shrank from her!"" Quoth the Sultan, ""How could this whore play her tricks upon us twice? But by the Almighty I will not depart hence till I fill her cleft with molten lead and jail her with the jailing of a bird encaged, then bind her with her own hair and crucify her over the gate of Constantinople."" And he called to mind his brother and wept with excessive weeping. But when Zat al-Dawahi arrived amongst the Infidels and related to them her adventures at length, they rejoiced at her safety and at the slaying of Sharrkan. There upon the Moslems addressed themselves again to the siege of the city and the Sultan promised his men that, if it should be taken, he would divide its treasures among them in equal parts. But he dried not his tears grieving for his brother till his body was wasted and sick, growing thin as a tooth pick. Presently the Wazir Dandan came in to him and said, ""Be of good cheer and keep thine eyes cool and clear; in very sooth thy brother died not but because his hour was come, and there is no profit in this mourning. How well saith the poet,
""Whatso is not to be no sleight shall bring to pass; * What is to
             be without a failure shall become;
Soon the becoming fortune shall be found to be, * And Folly's
             brother shall abide forlorn and glum.""
Wherefore do thou leave this weeping and wailing and hearten thy heart to bear arms."" He replied, ""O Wazir, my heart is heavy for the death of my father and my brother and for our absence from hearth and home; and my mind is concerned for my subjects."" Thereupon the Wazir and the bystanders wept; but they ceased not from pushing forward the siege of Constantinople for a length of days. And they being thus, behold, news arrived from Baghdad, by one of the Emirs to the effect that the King's wife had been blessed with a boy, and that his sister, Nuzhat al-Zaman, had named him Kánmákán. Moreover, that the boy bid fair to be famous, already showing wondrous signs and marvellous tokens; and that she had commanded the Olema and the preachers to pray for mother and child from the pulpits and bless them in all wise; furthermore that the twain were well, that the land had enjoyed abundant rains, and that his comrade the Fireman was established in all prosperity, with eunuchs and slaves to wait upon him; but that he was still ignorant of what had befallen him. And she ended with the greeting of peace. Then quoth Zau al- Makan to the Wazir Dandan, ""Now is my back strengthened for that I have been blest with a son whose name is Kanmakan.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased saying her permitted say.
When it was the One Hundred and Sixth Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when they brought him the news of his wife having borne him a boy child, Zau al- Makan rejoiced with great joy and cried, ""Now is my back strengthened, for that I have been blessed with a son whose name is Kanmakan."" And he spake to the Wazir Dandan, saying, ""I am minded to leave this mourning and order perfections of the Koran for my brother and command almsdeeds on his account."" Quoth the Wazir, ""Thy design is good."" Thereupon he caused tents to be pitched over his brother's tomb; so they raised them and gathered together such of the men at arms as could repeat the Koran; and some began reciting the Holy volume; whilst others chanted litanies containing the names of Allah, and thus they did till the morning. Then Zau al-Makan went up to the grave of his brother Sharrkan and poured forth copious tears, and improvised these couplets,
""They bore him bier'd, and all who followed wept * With Moses'
         shrieks what day o'erhead shook Tor;
Till reached the grave which Pate had made his home, * Dug in
           men's souls who one sole God adore:
Ne'er had I thought before to see my joy * Borne on the bier
           which heads of bearers bore:
Ah no! nor ere they homed thee in the dust * That stars of
           heaven earth ever covered o'er.
Is the tomb dweller hostage of a stead, * Where light and
            splendour o'er thy face shall pour?
Praise to restore his life her word hath pledged: * Cribbed and
           confined he shall dispread the more!""
When Zau al-Makan had made an end of his versifying he wept and wept with him all the troops; then he came to the grave and threw himself upon it wild with woe, and the Wazir repeated the words of the poet,
""Pain leaving life that fleets thou hast th' eternal won; * Thou
            didst as whilom many a doer like thee hath done
Leftest this worldly house without reproach or blame; * Ah, may
            th' ex change secure thee every benison!
Thou west from hostile onset shield and firm defence, * For us to
            baffle shafts and whistling spears to shun.
I see this world is only cheat and vanity, * Where man naught
           else must seek but please the Truthful One:
Th' Empyrean's Lord allow thee bower of heavenly bliss, * And wi'
            thy faithful friends The Guide show goodly wone:
I bid thee last good e'en with sigh of bitter grief, * Seeing the
             West in woe for lack of Easting Sun.""

When the Wazir Dandan had finished his reciting, he wept with sore weeping and the tears rained from his eyes like cushioned pearls. Then came forward one who had been of Sharrkan's boon companions in his cups and he wept till ran in rills the drops, and he enumerated the dead man's generous qualities, reciting the following pentastichs,

""Where gone is Bounty since thy hand is turned to clay? * And I
             in misery lie since thou west ta'en away.
See'st not, O litter guide (Heaven keep thee glad and
             gay!), * How tears adorn my cheeks, these furrowed wrinkles
             fray?
                        A sight to joy shine eyes and fill thee with
                        dismay.
By Allah ne'er this heart within I spoke of thee; * Ah no! nor
             dared my sight to see thy brilliancy:
Save that my tear drops sorest wound have garred me dree * Yea!
             and if e'er on other rest these eyne of me,
                        May yearning draw their reins nor suffer sleep to see.""

And when the man stinted reciting, Zau al-Makan and the Minister Dandan wept and the whole army was moved to tears; after which all retired to their tents, and the King turning to the Wazir took counsel with him concerning the conduct of the campaign. On this wise the two passed days and nights, while Zau al-Makan was weighed down with grief and mourning till at last he said, ""I long to hear stories and adventures of Kings and tales of lover folk enslaved by love; haply Allah may make this to solace that which is on my heart of heavy anxiety, and stint and stay my weeping and wailing."" Quoth the Wazir, ""If naught can dispel thy trouble but hearing curious tales of Kings and people long gone before and stories of folk enslaved by love of yore, and so forth, this thing were easy, for I had no other business, in the lifetime of thy father (who hath found mercy) than to relate stories and to repeat verses to him. This very night I will tell thee a tale of a lover and his beloved, so shall thy breast be broadened."" When Zau al-Makan heard these words from the Minister, his heart was set upon that which had been promised to him and he did nothing but watch for the coming of the night, that he might hear what the Wazir Dandan had to tell of the Kings of yore and distracted lovers long gone before. And hardly would he believe that night had fallen ere he bade light the wax candles and the lamps and bring all that was needful of meat and drink and perfume gear, and what not; and when all was in presence, he summoned the Wazir Dandan, and the Emirs Rustam and Bahram and Tarkash and the Grand Chamberlain; then waited till the whole party was seated before him; whereupon he turned to the Minister and said, ""Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us."" Replied the Wazir, ""With joy and good will.""—And Shahrazad perceived the dawn of day and ceased to say her permitted say.
When it was the One Hundred and Seventh Night,
She said, It hath reached me, O auspicious King, that when King Zau Al-Makan summoned the Wazir and the Chamberlain and Rustam and Bahram, he turned towards the Minister Dandan and said, ""Know, O Wazir, that night is come and hath let down over us its veil of gloom, and we desire that thou tell us those tales which thou promisedst us."" Replied the Wazir, ""With love and gladness! Know, O auspicious King, that there reached my ears a relation of a lover and a loved one and of the discourse between them and what befel them of things rare and fair, a story such as repelleth care from the heart and dispelleth sorrow like unto that of the patriarch Jacob; and it is as follows"":
Footnotes:

 This knightly tale, the longest in the Nights (xliv.— cxlv.), about one-eighth of the whole, does not appear in the Bres. Edit. Lane, who finds it ""objectionable,"" reduces it to two of its episodes, Azíz-cum-Azízah and Táj al-Mulúk. On the other hand it has been converted into a volume (8vo, pp. 240) ""Scharkan, Conte Arabe,"" etc. Traduit par M. Asselan Riche, etc. Paris: Dondey-Dupré. 1829. It has its longueurs and at times is longsome enough; but it is interesting as a comparison between the chivalry of Al-Islam and European knight-errantry. Although all the characters are fictitious the period is evidently in the early crusading days. Cæsarea, the second capital of Palestine, taken during the Caliphate of Omar (A.H. 19) and afterwards recovered, was fortified in A.H. 353 = 963 as a base against the Arabs by the Emperor Phocas, the Arab. ""Nakfúr"" i.e. Nicephorus. In A.H. 498=1104, crusading craft did much injury by plundering merchantmen between Egypt and Syria, to which allusion is found in the romance. But the story teller has not quite made up his mind about which Cæsarea he is talking, and M. Riche tells us that Césarée is a ""ville de la Mauritanie, en Afrique"" (p. 20).
 The fifth Ommiade Caliph reign. A.H. 65-86 = 685-704.
 This does not merely mean that no one was safe from his wrath: or, could approach him in the heat of fight: it is a reminiscence of the masterful ""King Kulayb,"" who established game-laws in his dominions and would allow no man to approach his camp-fire. Moreover the Jinn lights a fire to decoy travellers, but if his victim be bold enough to brave him, he invites him to take advantage of the heat.
 China.
 The Jaxartes and the Bactrus (names very loosely applied).
 In full ""Sharrun kána"" i.e. an evil (Sharr) has come to being (kána) that is, ""bane to the foe"" a pagan and knightly name. The hero of the Romance ""Al-Dalhamah"" is described as a bitter gourd (colocynth), a viper, a calamity.
 This is a Moslem law (Koran chaps. iv. bodily borrowed from the Talmud) which does not allow a man to marry one wife unless he can carnally satisfy her. Moreover he must distribute his honours equally and each wife has a right to her night unless she herself give it up. This was the case even with the spouses of the Prophet; and his biography notices several occasions when his wives waived their rights in favour of one another M. Riche kindly provides the King with la piquante francaise (p. 15).
 So the celebrated mosque in Stambul, famed for being the largest church in the world is known to the Greeks as ""Agia (pron. Aya) Sophia"" and to Moslems as ""Aye Sofíyeh"" (Holy Wisdom) i.e. the Logos or Second Person of the Trinity (not a Saintess). The sending a Christian girl as a present to a Moslem would, in these days, be considered highly scandalous. But it was done by the Mukaukis or Coptic Governor of Egypt (under Heraclius) who of course hated the Greeks. This worthy gave two damsels to Mohammed; one called Sírín and the other Máriyah (Maria) whom the Prophet reserved for his especial use and whose abode is still shown at Al-Medinah. The Rev. Doctor Badger (loc. cit. p. 972) gives the translation of an epistle by Mohammed to this Mukaukis, written in the Cufic character ( ? ?) and sealed ""Mohammed, The Apostle of Allah."" My friend seems to believe that it is an original, but upon this subject opinions will differ. It is, however, exceedingly interesting, beginning with ""Bismillah,"" etc., and ending (before the signature) with a quotation from the Koran (iii. 57); and it may be assumed as a formula addressee to foreign potentates by a Prophet who had become virtually ""King of Arabia.""
 This prayer before ""doing the deed of kind"" is, I have said, Moslem as well Christian.
 Exodus i. 16, quoted by Lane (M. E., chaps. xxvii.).
Torrens in his Notes cites Drayton's ""Moon-calf':—
            Bring forth the birth-stool—no, let it alone;
            She is so far beyond all compass grown,
            Some other new device us needs must stead,
            Or else she never can be brought to bed.
It is the ""groaning-chair"" of Poor Robin's Almanac (1676) and we find it alluded to in Boccaccio, the classical sedile which according to scoffers has formed the papal chair (a curule seat) ever since the days of Pope Joan, when it has been held advisable for one of the Cardinals to ascertain that His Holiness possesses all the instruments of virility. This ""Kursí al-wiládah"" is of peculiar form on which the patient is seated. A most interesting essay might be written upon the various positions preferred during delivery, e.g. the wild Irish still stand on all fours, like the so-called ""lower animals."" Amongst the Moslems of Waday, etc., a cord is hung from the top of the hut, and the woman in labour holds on to it standing with her legs apart, till the midwife receives the child.
 Some Orientalists call ""lullilooing"" the trilling cry, which is made by raising the voice to its highest pitch and breaking it by a rapid succession of touches on the palate with the tongue-tip, others ""Ziraleet"" and Zagaleet, and one traveller tells us that it began at the marriage-festival of Isaac and Rebecca (!). Arabs term it classically ""Tahlíl"" and vulgarly ""Zaghrutah"" (Plur. Zaghárit) and Persians ""Kil."" Finally in Don Quixote we have ""Lelilies,"" the battle-cry of the Moors (Duffield iii. 289). Dr. Buchanan likens it to a serpent uttering human sounds, but the good missionary heard it at the festival of Jagannath. (Pilgrimage iii. 197 )
 i.e. ""Light of the Place"" (or kingdom) and ""Delight of the
Age.""
 It is utterly absurd to give the old heroic Persian name Afridun or Furaydun, the destroyer of Zohák or Zahhák to a Greek, but such anachronisms are characteristic of The Nights and are evidently introduced on purpose. See Boccaccio, ix. 9.
 Arab. ""Yunán"" lit. Ionia, which applies to all Greece, insular and continental, especially to ancient Greece.
 In 1870 I saw at Sidon a find of some hundreds of gold
""Philippi"" and ""Alexanders.""
 M. Riche has (p. 21), ""Ces talismans travaillés par le ciseau du célèbre Califaziri,"" adding in a note, ""Je pense que c'est un sculpteur Arabe.""
 This periphrase, containing what seems to us a useless negative, adds emphasis in Arabic.
 This bit of geographical information is not in the Bull
Edit.
 In Pers. = a tooth, the popular word.
 This preliminary move, called in Persian Nakl-i Safar, is generally mentioned. So the Franciscan monks in California, when setting out for a long journey through the desert, marched three times round the convent and pitched tents for the night under its walls.
 In Arab. ""Khazinah"" or ""Khaznah"" lit. a treasure, representing 1,000 ""Kís"" or purses (each=£5). The sum in the text is 7,000 purses X 5=£35,000.
 Travellers often prefer such sites because they are sheltered from the wind, and the ground is soft for pitching tents; but many have come to grief from sudden torrents following rain.
 Arab ""Ghábah"" not a forest in our sense of the word, but a place where water sinks and the trees (mostly Mimosas), which elsewhere are widely scattered, form a comparatively dense growth and collect in thickets. These are favourite places for wild beasts during noon-heats.
 At various times in the East Jews and Christians were ordered to wear characteristic garments, especially the Zunnár or girdle.
 The description is borrowed from the Coptic Convent, which invariably has an inner donjon or keep. The oldest monastery in the world is Mar Antonios (St. Anthony the Hermit) not far from Suez. (Gold Mines of Midian, p. 85.)
 ""Dawáhí,"" plur. of Dáhiyah = a mishap. The title means ""Mistress of Misfortunes"" or Queen of Calamities (to the enemy); and the venerable lady, as will be seen, amply deserved her name, which is pronounced Zát al-Dawáhí.
 Arab. ""Kunfuz""=hedgehog or porcupine.
 These flowers of speech are mere familiarities, not insults. In societies where the sexes are separated speech becomes exceedingly free. ""Étourdie que vous êtes,"" says M. Riche, toning down the text.
 Arab. ""Zirt,"" a low word. The superlative ""Zarrát"" (fartermost) or, ""Abu Zirt"" (Father of farts) is a facetious term among the bean-eating Fellahs and a deadly insult amongst the Badawin (Night ccccx.). The latter prefer the word Taggáa (Pilgrimage iii. 84). We did not disdain the word in farthingale=pet en air.
 Arab. ""kicked"" him, i.e. with the sharp corner of the shovel-stirrup. I avoid such expressions as ""spurring"" and ""pricking over the plain,"" because apt to give a wrong idea.
 Arab. ""Allaho Akbar!"" the classical Moslem slogan.
 Arab horses are never taught to leap, so she was quite safe on the other side of a brook nine feet broad.
 ""Batrík"" (vulg. Bitrík)=patricius, a title given to
Christian knights who commanded ten thousand men; the Tarkhan (or
Nobb) heading four thousand, and the Kaumas (Arab. Káid) two
hundred. It must not be confounded with Batrak (or
Batrik)=patriarcha. (Lane's Lex.)
 Arab. ""Kázi al-Kuzát,"" a kind of Chief Justice or Chancellor. The office wag established under the rule of Harun al Rashid, who so entitled Abú Yúsuf Ya'akab al-Ansári: therefore the allusion is anachronistic. The same Caliph also caused the Olema to dress as they do still.
 The allusion is Koranic: ""O men, if ye be in doubt concerning the resurrection, consider that He first created you of the dust of the ground (Adam), afterwards of seed"" (chaps. xxii.). But the physiological ideas of the Koran are curious. It supposes that the Mani or male semen is in the loins and that of women in the breast bone (chaps Ixxxvi.); that the mingled seed of the two (chaps. Ixxvi.) fructifies the ovary and that the child is fed through the navel with menstruous blood, hence the cessation of the catamenia. Barzoi (Kalilah and Dímnah) says:— ""Man's seed, falling into the woman's womb, is mixed with her seed and her blood: when it thickens and curdles the Spirit moves it and it turns about like liquid cheese; then it solidifies, its arteries are formed, its limbs constructed and its joints distinguished. If the babe is a male, his face is placed towards his mother's back; if a female, towards her belly."" (P. 262, Mr. L G.N. Keith- Falconer's translation.) But there is a curious prolepsis of the spermatozoa-theory. We read (Koran chaps. vii.), ""Thy Lord drew forth their posterity from the loins of the sons of Adam;"" and the commentators say that Allah stroked Adam's back and extracted from his loins all his posterity, which shall ever be, in the shape of small ants; these confessed their dependence on God and were dismissed to return whence they came."" From this fiction it appears (says Sale) that the doctrine of pre-existence is not unknown to the Mohammedans, and there is some little conformity between it and the modern theory of generatio ex animalculis in semine marium. The poets call this Yaum-i-Alast = the Day of Am-I-not (-your Lord)? which Sir William Jones most unhappily translated ""Art thou not with thy Lord ?"" (Alasta bi Rabbi- kum); fand they produce a grand vision of unembodied spirits appearing in countless millions before their Creator.
 The usual preliminary of a wrestling bout.
 In Eastern wrestling this counts as a fair fail. So Ajax fell on his back with Ulysses on his breast. (Iliad xxxii., 700, etc.)
 So biting was allowed amongst the Greeks in the , the final struggle on the ground.
 Supposed to be names of noted wrestlers. ""Kayim"" (not El-Kim as Torrens has it) is a term now applied to a juggler or ""professor"" of legerdemain who amuses people in the streets with easy tricks. (Lane, M. E., chaps. xx.)
 Lit. ""laughed in his face"" which has not the unpleasant meaning it bears in English.
 Arab. ""Abu riyáh""=a kind of child's toy. It is our ""bull-roarer"" well known in Australia and parts of Africa.
 The people of the region south of the Caspian which is called ""Sea of Daylam."" It has a long history; for which see D'Herbelot, s.v. ""Dilem.""
 Coptic convents in Egypt still affect these drawbridges over the keep-moat.
 Koran iv., xxii. etc., meaning it is lawful to marry women taken in war after the necessary purification although their husbands be still living. This is not permitted with a free woman who is a True Believer. I have noted that the only concubine slave-girl mentioned in the Koran are these ""captives possessed by the right hand.""
 The Amazonian dame is a favourite in folk-lore and is an ornament to poetry from the Iliad to our modern day. Such heroines, apparently unknown to the Pagan Arabs, were common in the early ages of Al-Islam as Ockley and Gibbon prove, and that the race is not extinct may be seen in my Pilgrimage (iii. 55) where the sister of Ibn Rumi resolved to take blood revenge for her brother.
 And Solomon said, ""O nobles, which of you will bring me her throne ?"" A terrible genius (i.e. an If rit of the Jinn named Dhakwan or the notorious Sakhr) said, "" I will bring it unto thee before thou arise from thy seat (of justice); for I am able to perform it, and may be trusted"" (Koran, xxvii. 38-39). Balkís or Bilkís (says the Durrat al-Ghawwás) daughter of Hozád bin Sharhabíl, twenty-second in the list of the rulers of Al- Yaman, according to some murdered her husband, and became, by Moslem ignorance, the Biblical "" Queen of Sheba."" The Abyssinians transfer her from Arabian Saba to Ethiopia and make her the mother by Solomon of Menelek, their proto-monarch; thus claiming for their royalties an antiquity compared with which all reigning houses in the world are of yesterday. The dates of the Tabábi'ah or Tobbas prove that the Bilkis of history ruled Al-Yaman in the early Christian era.
 Arab. ""Fass,"" fiss or fuss; the gem set in a ring; also applied to a hillock rounded en cabochon. In The Nights it is used to signify ""a fine gem.""
 This prominence of the glutæi muscles is always insisted upon, because it is supposed to promise well in a bed-fellow. In Somali land where the people are sub- steatopygous, a rich young man, who can afford such luxury, will have the girls drawn up in line and choose her to wife who projects furthest behind
 The ""bull"" is only half mine.
 A favourite Arab phrase, the ""hot eye"" is one full of tears.
 i.e., ""Coral,"" coral branch, a favourite name for a slave-girl, especially a negress. It is the older ""Morgiana."" I do not see why Preston in Al-Haríni's ""Makamah (Séance) of Singar"" renders it pearls, because Golius gives ""small pearls,"" when it is evidently ""coral."" Richardson (Dissert. xlviii.) seems to me justified in finding the Pari (fairy) Marjan of heroic Persian history reflected in the Fairy Morgain who earned off King Arthur after the battle of Camelon.
 Arab. ""'Ud Jalaki""=Jalak or Jalik being a poetical and almost obsolete name of Damascus.
 The fountain in Paradise whose water shall be drunk with ""pure"" wine mixed and sealed with musk (for clay). It is so called because it comes from the ""Sanam"" (Sanima, to be high) boss or highest ridge of the Moslem Heaven (Koran lv. 78 and lxxxiii. 27). Mr. Rodwell says ""it is conveyed to the highest apartments in the Pavilions of Paradise."" (?)
 This ""hysterical"" temperament is not rare even amongst the bravest Arabs.
 An idea evidently derived from the Æolipyla (olla animatoria) the invention of Hero Alexandrinus, which showed that the ancient Egyptians could apply the motive force of steam.
 Kuthayyir ibn Abi Jumah, a poet and far-famed Ráwí or Tale-reciter, mentioned by Ibn Khallikan he lived at Al-Medinah and sang the attractions of one Azzah, hence his soubriquet Sáhib (lover of) Azzah. As he died in A. H. 105 (=726), his presence here is a gross anachronism the imaginary Sharrkan flourished before the Caliphate of Abd al-Malik bin Marwán A. H. 65-86.
 Jamíl bin Ma'amar, a poet and lover contemporary with
Al-Kuthayrir.
 Arab. ""Tafazzal,"" a word of frequent use in conversation=""favour me,"" etc.
 The word has a long history. From the Gr. or is the Lat. stibium; while the Low Latin ""antimonium"" and the Span. Althimod are by metathesis for Al-Ithmid. The dictionaries define the substance as a stone from which antimony is prepared, but the Arabs understand a semi-mythical mineral of yellow colour which enters into the veins of the eyes and gives them Iynx-like vision. The famous Anz nicknamed Zarká (the blue eyed) of Yamámah (Province) used it; and, according to some, invented Kohl. When her (protohistoric) tribe Jadis had destroyed all the rival race of Tasm, except Ribáh ibn Murrah; the sole survivor fled to the Tobba of Al-Yaman, who sent a host to avenge him. The king commanded his Himyarites to cut tree-boughs and use them as screens (again Birnam wood). Zarká from her Utum, or peel-tower, saw the army three marches off and cried, ""O folk, either trees or Himyar are coming upon you!"" adding, in Rajaz verse:—
I swear by Allah that trees creep onward, or that Himyar beareth somewhat which he draweth along!
She then saw a man mending his sandal. But Jadis disbelieved; Cassandra was slain and, when her eyes were cut out the vessels were found full of Ithmid. Hence Al-Mutanabbi sang:
""Sharper-sighted than Zarká of Jau"" (Yamámah).
See C. de Perceval i. 101; Arab. Prov. i. 192; and Chenery p. 381.
(The Assemblies of Al-Hariri; London, Williams and Norgate, 1867).
I have made many enquiries into the true nature of Ithmid and
failed to learn anything: on the Upper Nile the word is=Kohl.
 The general colour of chessmen in the East, where the game is played on a cloth more often than a board.
 Arab. ""Al-fil,"" the elephant=the French fol or fou and our bishop. I have derived ""elephant"" from Píl (old Persian, Sansk. Pilu) and Arab. Fil, with the article Al-Fil, whence the Greek the suffix—as being devoted to barbarous words as Obod-as (Al Ubayd), Aretas (Al-Háris), etc. Mr. Isaac Taylor (The Alphabet i. 169), preserves the old absurdity of ""eleph-ant or ox-like (!) beast of Africa."" Prof. Sayce finds the word al-ab (two distinct characters) in line 3, above the figure of an (Indian) elephant, on the black obelisk of Nimrod Mound, and suggests an Assyrian derivation.
 Arab. ""Shaukat"" which may also mean the ""pride"" or ""mainstay"" (of the army).
 Lit. ""smote him on the tendons of his neck."" This is the famous shoulder-cut (Tawash shuh) which, with the leg-cut (Kalam), formed, and still forms, the staple of Eastern attack with the sword.
 Arab. ""Dirás."" Easterns do not thresh with flails. The material is strewed over a round and smoothed floor of dried mud in the open air and threshed by different connivances. In Egypt the favourite is a chair-like machine called ""Norag,"" running on iron plates and drawn by bulls or cows over the corn. Generally, however, Moslems prefer the old classical , the Tribulum of Virgil and Varro, a slipper-shaped sled of wood garnished on the sole with large-headed iron nails, or sharp fragments of flint or basalt. Thus is made the ""Tibn"" or straw, the universal hay of the East, which our machines cannot imitate.
 These numbers appear to be grossly exaggerated, but they were possible in the days of sword and armour: at the battle of Saffayn the Caliph Ali is said to have cut down five hundred and twenty-three men in a single night.
 Arab. ""Bika'á"": hence the ""Buka'ah"" or Clesyria.
 Richardson in his excellent dictionary (note 103) which modern priggism finds ""unscientific "" wonderfully derives this word from Arab. ""Khattáf,"" a snatcher (i.e. of women), a ravisher. It is an evident corruption of ""captivus"" through Italian and French
 These periodical and fair-like visitations to convents are still customary; especially amongst the Christians of Damascus.
 Camphor being then unknown.
 The ""wrecker"" is known all over the world; and not only barbarians hold that ships driven ashore become the property of the shore
 Arab. ""Jokh"": it is not a dictionary word, but the only term in popular use for European broadcloth.
 The second person plural is used because the writer would involve the subjects of his correspondent in the matter.
 This part of the phrase, which may seem unnecessary to the European, is perfectly intelligible to all Orientalists. You may read many an Eastern letter and not understand it. Compare Boccacoo iv. 1.
 i.e. he was greatly agitated
 In text ""Li-ajal a al-Taudi'a,"" for the purpose of farewelling, a low Egyptianism; emphatically a ""Kalám wáti."" (Pilgrimage thee iii. 330.)
 In the Mac. Edit. Sharrkan speaks, a clerical error.
 The Farsakh (Germ. Stunde) a measure of time rather than distance, is an hour's travel or its equivalent, a league, a meile=three English stat. miles. The word is still used in Persia its true home, but not elsewhere. It is very old, having been determined as a lineal measure of distance by Herodotus (ii. 5 and 6 ; v. 53), who computes it at 30 furlongs (=furrow-lengths, 8 to the stat. mile). Strabo (xi.) makes it range from 40 to 60 stades (each=606 feet 9 inches), and even now it varies between 1,500 to 6,000 yards. Captain Francklin (Tour to Persia) estimates it = about four miles. (Pilgrimage ii. 113.)
 Arab. ""Ashhab."" Names of colours are few amongst semi civilised peoples, but in Arabia there is a distinct word for every shade of horseflesh.
 She had already said to him ""Thou art beaten in everything!""
 Showing that she was still a Christian.
 This is not Badawi sentiment: the honoratioren amongst wild people would scorn such foul play; but amongst the settled Arabs honour between men and women is unknown and such ""hocussing"" would be held quite fair.
 The table of wine, in our day, is mostly a japanned tray with glasses and bottles, saucers of pickles and fruits and, perhaps, a bunch of flowers and aromatic herbs. During the Caliphate the ""wine-service"" was on a larger scale.
 Here the ""Bhang"" (almost a generic term applied to hellebore, etc.) may be hyoscyamus or henbane. Yet there are varieties of Cannabis, such as the Dakha of South Africa capable of most violent effect. I found the use of the drug well known to the negroes of the Southern United States and of the Brazil, although few of their owners had ever heard of it.
 Amongst Moslems this is a reference to Adam who first ""sinned against himself,' and who therefore is called "" Safíyu'llah,"" the Pure of Allah. (Pilgrimage iii. 333.)
 Meaning, an angry, violent man.
 Arab. ""Inshád,"" which may mean reciting the verse of another or improvising one's own. In Modern Egypt ""Munshid"" is the singer or reciter of poetry at Zikrs (Lane M. E. chaps. xxiv.). Here the verses are quite bad enough to be improvised by the hapless Princess.
 The negro skin assumes this dust colour in cold, fear, concupiscence and other mental emotions.
 He compares her glance with the blade of a Yamani sword, a lieu commun of Eastern poetry. The weapons are famous in The Nights; but the best sword-cutlery came from Persia as the porcelain from China to Sana'á. Here, however, is especial allusion as to the sword ""Samsam"" or ""Samsamah."" It belonged to the Himyarite Tobba, Amru bin Ma'ad Kurb, and came into the hands of Harun al-Rashid. When the Emperor of the Greeks sent a present of superior sword-blades to him by way of a brave, the Caliph, in the presence of the Envoys, took ""Samsam"" in hand and cut the others in twain as if they were cabbages without the least prejudice to the edge of ""Samsam.""
 This touch of pathos is truly Arab. So in the ""Romance of Dalhamah"" (Lane, M. E. xxiii.) the infant Gundubah sucks the breast of its dead mother and the King exclaims, ""If she had committed this crime she would not be affording the child her milk after she was dead.""
 Arab. ""Sadda'l-Aktár,"" a term picturesque enough to be preserved in English. ""Sadd,"" I have said, is a wall or dyke, the term applied to the great dam of water- plants which obstructs the navigation of the Upper Nile, the lilies and other growths floating with the current from the (Victoria) Nyanza Lake. I may note that we need no longer derive from India the lotus-llily so extensively used by the Ancient Egyptians and so neglected by the moderns that it has well nigh disappeared. All the Central African basins abound in the Nymphæa and thence it found its way down the Nile Valley.
 Arab. ""Al Marhúmah"": equivalent to our ""late lamented.""
 Vulgarly pronounced ""Mahmal,"" and by Egyptians and Turks ""Mehmel."" Lane (M. E. xxiv.) has figured this queenly litter and I have sketched and described it in my Pilgrimage (iii. 12).
 For such fits of religious enthusiasm see my Pilgrimage (iii. 254).
 ""Irák"" (Mesopotamia) means ""a level country beside the banks of a ever.""
 ""Al Kuds,"" or ""Bays al-Mukaddas,"" is still the popular name of Jerusalem, from the Heb. Yerushalaim ha-Kadushah (legend on shekel of Simon Maccabeus).
 ""Follow the religion of Abraham"" says the Koran (chaps. iii. 89). Abraham, titled ""Khalílu'llah,"" ranks next in dignity to Mohammed, preceding Isa, I need hardly say that his tomb is not in Jerusalem nor is the tomb itself at Hebron ever visited. Here Moslems (soi disant) are allowed by the jealousies of Europe to close and conceal a place which belongs to the world, especially to Jews and Christians. The tombs, if they exist, lie in a vault or cave under the Mosque.
 Abá, or Abáyah, vulg. Abayah, is a cloak of hair, goat's or camel's; too well known to require description.
 Arab. ""Al-Wakkád,"" the man who lights and keeps up the bath-fires.
 Arab. ""Má al-Khaláf"" (or ""Khiláf"") a sickly perfume but much prized, made from the flowers of the Salix Ægyptiaca.
 Used by way of soap; like glasswort and other plants.
 i.e., ""Thou art only just recovered.""
 To ""Nakh"" is to gurgle ""Ikh! Ikh!"" till the camel kneels. Hence the space called ""Barr al-Manákhah"" in Al-Medinah (Pilgrimage i. 222, ii. 91). There is a regular camel vocabulary amongst the Arabs, made up like our ""Gee"" (go ye!), etc. of significant words worn down.
 Arab. ""Laza,"" the Second Hell provided for Jews.
 The word has been explained (vol. i. 112). It is trivial, not occurring in the Koran which uses ""Arabs of the Desert ;"" ""Arabs who dwell in tents,"" etc. (chaps. ix. and xxxiii.). ""A'arábi"" is the classical word and the origin of ""Arab"" is disputed. According to Pocock (Notæ Spec. Hist. Arab.): ""Diverse are the opinions concerning the denomination of the Arabs; but the most certain of all is that which draws it from Arabah, which is part of the region of Tehama (belonging to Al-Medinah Pilgrimage ii. 118), which their father Ismail afterwards inhabited."" Tehamah (sierra caliente) is the maritime region of Al Hijaz, the Moslems Holy Land; and its ""Arabah,"" a very small tract which named a very large tract, must not be confounded, as some have done, with the Wady Arabah, the ancient outlet of the Dead Sea. The derivation of ""Arab"" from ""Ya'arab"" a fancied son of Joktan is mythological. In Heb. Arabia may be called ""Eretz Ereb"" (or ""Arab"")=land of the West; but in Arabic ""Gharb"" (not Ereb) is the Occident and the Arab dates long before the Hebrew.
 ""When thine enemy extends his hand to thee, cut it off if thou can, or kiss it,"" wisely said Caliph al-Mansur.
 The Tartur was a peculiar turban worn by the Northern Arabs and shown in old prints. In modern Egypt the term is applied to the tall sugar-loaf caps of felt affected mostly by regular Dervishes. Burckhardt (Proverbs 194 and 398) makes it the high cap of felt or fur proper to the irregular cavalry called Dely or Delaty. In Dar For (Darfour) ""Tartur"" is a conical cap adorned with beads and cowries worn by the Manghwah or buffoon who corresponds with the Egyptian ""Khalbús"" or ""Maskharah"" and the Turkish ""Sutari."" For an illustration see Plate iv. fig. 10 of Voyage au Darfour par Mohammed El Tounsy (The Tunisian), Paris, Duprat, 1845.
 The term is picturesque and true; we say ""gnaw,"" which is not so good.
 Here, meaning an Elder, a Chief, etc.; the word has been almost naturalised in English. I have noted that Abraham was the first ""Shaykh.""
 This mention of weighing suggests the dust of Dean Swift and the money of the Gold Coast It was done, I have said, because the gold coin, besides being ""sweated"" was soft and was soon worn down.
 Fem. of Nájí (a deliverer, a saviour)=Salvadora.
 This, I have noted, is according to Koranic command (chaps. iv. 88). ""When you are saluted with a salutation, salute the person with a better salutation."" The longer answer to ""Peace be with (or upon) thee! "" is still universally the custom. The ""Salem"" is so differently pronounced by every Eastern nation that the observant traveller will easily make of it a Shibboleth.
 The Badawi, who was fool as well as rogue, begins to fear that he has kidnapped a girl of family.
 These examinations being very indecent are usually done in strictest privacy. The great point is to make sure of virginity.
 This is according to strict Moslem law: the purchaser may not look at the girl's nakedness till she is his, and he ought to manage matters through an old woman.
 Lit. wrath; affliction which chokes; in Hindustani it means simply anger.
 i.e. Heaven forbid I be touched by a strange man.
 Used for fuel and other purposes, such as making ""doss stick.""
 Arab ""Yaftah'Allah"" the offer being insufficient. The rascal is greedy as a Badaw and moreover he is a liar, which the Badawi is not.
 The third of the four great Moslem schools of Theology, taking its name from the Imam al-Sháfi'í (Mohammed ibn Idrís) who died in Egypt A.H. 204, and lies buried near Cairo. (Sale's Prel. Disc. sect. viii.)
 The Moslem form of Cabbala, or transcendental philosophy of the Hebrews.
 Arab. ""Bakh"" the word used by the Apostle to Ali his son-in-law. It is the Latin ""Euge.""
 Readers, who read for amusement, will do well to ""skip"" the fadaises of this highly educated young woman.
 There are three Persian Kings of this name (Artaxerxes)

 Alluding to the proverb, ""Folk follow their King's faith,""

 Second Abbaside, A.H. 136-158 (=754-775).
 The celebrated companion of Mohammed who succeeded Abu Bakr in the Caliphate (A.H. 13-23=634-644). The Sunnis know him as Al-Adil the Just, and the Shiahs detest him for his usurpation, his austerity and harshness. It is said that he laughed once and wept once. The laugh was caused by recollecting how he ate his dough-gods (the idols of the Hanifah tribe) in The Ignorance. The tears were drawn by remembering how he buried alive his baby daughter who, while the grave was being dug, patted away the dust from his hair and beard. Omar was doubtless a great man, but he is one of the most ungenial figures in Moslem history which does not abound in genialities. To me he suggests a Puritan, a Covenanter of the sourest and narrowest type; and I cannot wonder that the Persians abhor him, and abuse him on all occasions.
 The austere Caliph Omar whose scourge was more feared than the sword was the - author of the celebrated saying ""Consult them (feminines) and do clear contrary-wise.""
 Our ""honour amongst thieves.""
 The sixth successor of Mohammed and founder of the Banu Umayyah or Ommiades, called the ""sons of the little mother"" from their eponymus (A.H. 41-60=661-680). For his Badawi wife Maysun, and her abuse of her husband, see Pilgrimage iii. 262.
 Shaykh of the noble tribe, or rather nation, Banu Tamím and a notable of the day, surnamed, no one knows why, ""Sire of the Sea.""
 This is essential for cleanliness in hot lands: however much the bath may be used, the body-pile and lower hair, if submitted to a microscope, will show more or less sordes adherent. The axilla-hair is plucked because if shaved the growing pile causes itching and the depilatories are held deleterious. At first vellication is painful but the skin becomes used to it. The pecten is shaved either without or after using depilatories, of which more presently. The body-pile is removed by ""Takhfíf""; the Libán Shámi (Syrian incense), a fir- gum imported from Scio, is melted and allowed to cool in the form of a pledget. This is passed over the face and all the down adhering to it is pulled up by the roots (Burckhardt No. 420). Not a few Anglo-Indians have adopted these precautions
 This Caliph was a tall, fair, handsome man of awe-inspiring aspect. Omar used to look at him and say, ""This is the Cæsar of the Arabs,"" while his wife called him a ""fatted ass.""
 The saying is attributed to Abraham when ""exercised"" by the unkindly temper of Sarah; ""woman is made hard and crooked like a rib;"" and the modern addition is, ""whoso would straighten her, breaketh her.""
 i.e. ""When ready and in erection.""
 ""And do first (before going in to your wives) some act which may be profitable unto your souls"" or, for you: soul's good. (Koran, chaps. ii. 223.) Hence Ahnaf makes this prayer.
 It was popularly said that ""Truth-speaking left Omar without a friend."" Entitled ""The Just"" he was murdered by Abu Lúlúah, alias Fírúz, a (Magian ?) slave of Al-Maghírah for denying him justice.

Mu'awiyah afterwards governor of Bassorah, Cufa and Al-Hijaz.
 The seditions in Kufah were mainly caused by the wilful nepotism of Caliph Othman bin Asákir which at last brought about his death. His main quality seems to have been personal beauty: ""never was seen man or woman of fairer face than he and he was the most comely of men:"" he was especially famed for beautiful teeth which in old age he bound about with gold wire. He is described as of middling stature, large- limbed, broad shouldered, fleshy of thigh and long in the fore-arm which was hairy. His face inclined to yellow and was pock-marked; his beard was full and his curly hair, which he dyed yellow, fell below his ears. He is called ""writer of the Koran"" from his edition of the M.S., and ""Lord of the two Lights"" because he married two of the Prophet's daughters, Rukayyah and Umm Kulthum; and, according to the Shi'ahs who call him Othman-i-Lang or"" limping Othman,"" he vilely maltreated them. They justify his death as the act of an Ijmá' al-Muslimín, the general consensus of Moslems which ratifies ""Lynch law."" Altogether Othman is a mean figure in history.
 ""Nár"" (fire) is a word to be used delicately from its connection with Gehenna. You say, e.g. ""bring me a light, a coal (bassah)"" etc.; but if you say ""bring me fire! "" the enemy will probably remark ""He wanteth fire even before his time!"" The slang expression would be ""bring the sweet."" (Pilgrimage i. 121.)
 Omar is described as a man of fair complexion, and very ruddy, but he waxed tawny with age, when he also became bald and grey. He had little hair on the cheeks but a long mustachio with reddish ends. In stature he overtopped the people and was stout as he was tall. A popular saying of Mohammed's is, ""All (very) long men are fools save Omar, and all (very) short men are knaves save Ali."" The Persians, who abhor Omar, compare every lengthy, ungainly, longsome thing with him; they will say, ""This road never ends, like the entrails of Omar."" We know little about Ali's appearance except that he was very short and stout, broad and full-bellied with a tawny complexion and exceedingly hairy, his long beard, white as cotton, filling all the space between his shoulders. He was a ""pocket. Hercules,"" and incredible tales, like that about the gates of Khaybar, are told of his strength. Lastly, he was the only Caliph who bequeathed anything to literature: his ""Cantiloquium"" is famous and he has left more than one mystical and prophetic work. See Ockley for his ""Sentences"" and D'Herbelot s. D. ""Ali"" and ""Gebr."" Ali is a noble figure in Moslem history.
 The emancipation from the consequences of his sins; or it may mean a holy death.
 Battle fought near Al-Medinah A.D. 625. The word is derived from ""shad"" (one). I have described the site in my Pilgrimage, (vol. ii. 227).
 ""Haphsa"" in older writers; Omar's daughter and one of Mohammed's wives, famous for her connection with the manuscripts of the Koran. From her were (or claimed to be) descended the Hafsites who reigned in Tunis and extended their power far and wide over the Maghrib (Mauritania), till dispossessed by the Turks.
 i.e. humbly without the usual strut or swim: it corresponds with the biblical walking or going softly. (I Kings xxi. 27; Isaiah xxxviii. 15, etc.)
 A theologian of the seventh and eighth centuries.
 i.e. to prepare himself by good works, especially alms-giving, for the next world.
 A theologian of the eighth century.
 Abd al-Aziz was eighth Ommiade (regn. A.H. 99=717) and the fifth of the orthodox, famed for a piety little known to his house. His most celebrated saying was, "" Be constant in meditation on death: if thou bein straitened case 'twill enlarge it, and if in affluence 'twill straiten it upon thee."" He died. poisoned, it is said, in A.H 101,
 Abu Bakr originally called Abd al-Ka'abah (slave of the Ka'abah) took the name of Abdullah and was surnamed Abu Bakr (father of the virgin) when Mohammed, who before had married only widows, took to wife his daughter, the famous or infamous Ayishah. ""Bikr"" is the usual form, but ""Bakr,"" primarily meaning a young camel, is metaphorically applied to human youth (Lane's Lex. s. c.). The first Caliph was a cloth-merchant, like many of the Meccan chiefs. He is described as very fair with bulging brow, deep set eyes and thin-checked, of slender build and lean loined, stooping and with the backs of his hands fleshless. He used tinctures of Henna and Katam for his beard. The Persians who hate him, call him ""Pir-i-Kaftár,"" the old she-hyaena, and believe that he wanders about the deserts of Arabia in perpetual rut which the males must satisfy.
 The second, fifth, sixth and seventh Ommiades.

 Brother of this Omar's successor, Yezid II.

 Calling to the slaves.
 When the ""Day of Arafat"" (9th of Zú'l-Hijjah) falls upon a Friday. For this Hajj al- Akbar see my Pilgrimage iii. 226. It is often confounded by writers (even by the learned M. Caussin de Perceval) with the common Pilgrimage as opposed to the Umrah, or "" Lesser Pilgrimage"" (ibid. iii. 342, etc.). The latter means etymologically cohabiting with a woman in her father's house as opposed to 'Ars or leading her to the husband's home: it is applied to visiting Meccah and going through all the pilgrim-rites but not at the Pilgrimage-season. Hence its title ""Hajj al-Asghar"" the ""Lesser Hajj."" But ""Umrah"" is also applied to a certain ceremony between the hills Safá (a large hard rock) and Marwah (stone full of flints), which accompanies the Hajj and which I have described (ibid. iii. 344). At Meccah I also heard of two places called Al-Umrah, the Greater in the Wady Fátimah and the Lesser half way nearer the city (ibid. iii. 344).
 A fair specimen of the unworthy egoism which all religious systems virtually inculcate Here a pious father leaves his children miserable to save his own dirty soul.
 Chief of the Banú Tamín, one of the noblest of tribes, derived from Tamím, the uncle of Kuraysh (Koreish); hence the poets sang:—
             There cannot be a son nobler than Kuraysh,
             Nor an uncle nobler than Tamím.
The high minded Tamín is contrasted with the mean-spirited Kays, who also gave rise to a tribe; and hence the saying concerning one absolutely inconsistent, ""Art thou now Tamín and then Kays?""
 Surnamed Al-Sakafi, Governor of Al-Yaman and Irak.
 Tenth Ommiade (regn. A H. 105-125 = 724-743).
 Or ""clothe thee in worn-out clothes"" i.e. ""Become a Fakir"" or religious mendicant.
 This gratuitous incest in ignorance injures the tale and is as repugnant to Moslem as to Christian taste.
 The child is named either on the day of its birth or on that day week. The father whispers it in the right ear, often adding the Azán or prayer-call, and repeating in the left ear the ""Ikámah"" or Friday sentence. There are many rules for choosing names according to the week-day, the ascendant planet, the ""Sortes Coranicæ,"" etc.
 Amongst Moslems as amongst Christians there are seven deadly sins: idolatry, murder, falsely charging modest women with unchastity, robbing orphans, usury, desertion in Holy War and disobedience to parents. The difference between the two creeds is noteworthy. And the sage knows only three, intemperance, ignorance and egoism.
 Meaning, ""It was decreed by Destiny; so it came to pass,"" appropriate if not neat.
 The short, stout, dark, long-haired and two-bunched camel from ""Bukhtar"" (Bactria), the ""Eastern"" (Bakhtar) region on the Amu or Jayhun (Oxus) River; afterwards called Khorasan. The two-humped camel is never seen in Arabia except with northern caravans, and to speak of it would be a sore test of Badawi credulity.
 ""Kaylúlah"" is the ""forty-winks"" about noon: it is a Sunnat or Practice of the Prophet who said, ""Make the mid-day siesta, for verily at this hour the devils sleep not."" ""Aylúlain"" is slumbering after morning prayers (our ""beauty-sleep""), causing heaviness andid leness: ""Ghaylúlah"" is dozing about 9 a.m. engendering poverty and wretchedness: ""Kaylúlah"" (with the guttural Kaf) is sleeping before evening prayers and ""Faylúlah"" is slumbering after sunset—both held to be highly detrimental. (Pilgrimage ii 49.)
 The Biblical ""Hamath"" (Hightown) too well known to require description. It is still famous for the water-wheels mentioned by al-Hariri (assembly of the Banu Harám).
 When they say, ""The levee flashes bright on the hills of
Al-Yaman,"" the allusion is to the south quarter, where
summer-lightning is seen. Al-Yaman (always with the article) means,
I have said, the right-hand region to one facing the rising sun and
Al-Sham (Syria) the left-hand region.
 Again ""he"" for ""she,"" in delicacy and jealousy of making public the beauty or conditions of the ""veiled sex."" Even public singers would hesitate to use a feminine pronoun. As will be seen however, the rule is not invariably kept and hardly ever in Badawi poetry.
 The normal pun on ""Nuzhat al-Zaman"" = Delight of the Age or Time.

 Mr. Payne (ii. 109) borrows this and the next quotation from the Bull Edit. i. 386.
 For the expiation of inconsiderate oaths see Koran (chaps. v.). I cannot but think that Al-Islam treats perjury too lightly: all we can say is-that it improves upon Hinduism which practically seems to leave the punishment to the gods.

 Arab. ""Nímshah"" from the Pers. Nímchah, a ""half-sword,"" a long dagger worn in the belt. Richardson derives it from Namsh, being freckled (damasked).
 The Indian term for a tent large enough to cover a troop of cavalry.
 Arab. ""Marhúm"" a formula before noticed. It is borrowed from the Jewish, ""of blessed memory"" (after the name of the honoured dead, Prov. x. 17.); with the addition of ""upon whom be peace,"" as opposed to the imprecation, ""May the name of the wicked rot!""

 An eminent traditionist of the eighth century (A.D.).
 The prayers of the Fast-month and Pilgrimage-month are often said in especial places outside the towns and cities; these are the Indian Id(Eed-)gáh. They have a screen of wall about a hundred yards long with a central prayer-niche and the normal three steps for the preacher; and each extremity is garnished with an imitation minaret. They are also called Namáz-gah and one is sketched by Herklots (Plate iii. fig. 2). The object of the trips thither in Zu'l-Ka'adah and Zu'l-Hijjah is to remind Moslems of the ""Ta'aríf,"" or going forth from Meccah to Mount Arafat.
 Arab. ""Al-Háfi,"" which in Egyptian means sore-footed as well. He was an ascetic of the eighth and ninth centuries (A.D.). He relates a tradition of the famous soldier saint Khálid bin Walíd who lies buried like the poet Ka'ab al-Ahbár near Hums (Emessa) once the Botia, Phrygia, Abdera, Suabia of Syria now Halbun (pronounced Halbáun) near Damascus. I cannot explain how this Kuraysh noble (a glorious figure in Moslem history) is claimed by the Afghans as one of their countrymen and made to speak Pukhtu or Pushtu, their rough old dialect of Persian. The curious reader will consult my Pilgrimage iii. 322 for the dialogue between Mohammed and Khalid. Again there is general belief in Arabia that the English sent a mission to the Prophet, praying that Khalid might be despatched to proselytise them: unfortunately Mohammed was dead and the ""Ingríz"" ratted. It is popularly held that no armed man can approach Khalid's grave; but I suppose my revolver did not count.

 Thus making Bishr the ""Imám"" (artistes) lit. one who stands in front. In Koran xvii. 74 it means ""leader"": in ii. 118 Allah makes Abraham an ""Imam to mankind.""
 A favourite sentiment in the East: we find it at the very beginning of Sa'di's Gulistan: better a weal-bringing lie than a harm-dealing truth.
 A penny, one sixth of the drachma.
 Founder of the Hanbali, fourth (in date) of the four orthodox Moslem schools. The Caliph al-Mu'atasim bi'llah, son of Harun al-Rashid, who believed the Koran to have been created and not a Logos (whatever that may be), co-eternal with Allah, scourged this Imam severely for ""differing in opinion"" (A.H. 220=833). In fact few of the notable reverends of that day escaped without a caress of the scourge or the sword.

 Arab. ""Músá"": the Egyptian word was ""Mesu,"" the ""child"" or the ""boy"" (brought up in the palace?), and the Hebrews made it ""Mosheh"" or ""one drawn out of the water;"" ""Mu"" in Egypt being water, the Arab ""Ma""; whence probably the moderns have derived the dim. ""Moyeh ,"" vulg. Egyptian for water.
 Koran, chaps. xxviii.: Shu'ayb is our Jethro: Koran, chaps. vii. and xi. Mr. Rodwell suggests (p. 101) that the name has been altered from Hobab (Numb. x. 29).
 Arab. ""Taub"" (Saub), the long shirt popularly written in English Tobe and pronounced so by Egyptians. It is worn by both sexes (Lane, M. E. chaps. i. ""Tob"") in Egypt, and extends into the heart of Moslem Africa: I can compare it with nothing but a long nightgown dyed a dirty yellow by safflower and about as picturesque as a carter's smock-frock.
 There is nothing of this in the Koran; and it is a most unhappy addition, as Moses utterly and pretentiously ignored a ""next world.""

 So says Al-Hariri (Ass. of Sasan), ""The neighbour before the house and the traveller before the journey."" In certain cities the neighbourhood is the real detective police, noting every action and abating scandals (such as orgies, etc.) with a strong hand and with the full consent of public opinion and of the authorities. This loving the neighbour shows evident signs of being borrowed from Christianity.

 Abu Hanifah was scourged for refusing to take office and was put to death in prison, it is said by poison (A.H. 150=A.D. 767), for a judicial sentence authorising rebellion against the second Abbaside, Al-Mansur, surnamed Abu'l-Dawánik (Father of Pence) for his exceeding avarice.
 ""Lá rayba fí-hi"" says the Koran (ii. 1) of itself; and the saying is popularly applied to all things of the Faith.
 Arab. ""Rivál al-Ghayb,"" somewhat like the ""Himalayan Brothers"" of modern superstition. See Herklots (Qanoon-e-Islam) for a long and careful description of these ""Mardán-i-Ghayb"" (Pers.), a ""class of people mounted on clouds,"" invisible, but moving in a circular orbit round the world, and suggesting the Hindu ""Lokapálas."" They should not be in front of the traveller nor on his right, but either behind or on his left hand. Hence tables, memorial couplets and hemistichs are required to ascertain the station, without which precaution journeys are apt to end badly.
 A sweetmeat before noticed.
 Door hinges in the east are two projections for the top and bottom of the leaf playing in hollows of the lintel and threshold. It appears to be the primitive form, for we find it in the very heart of Africa. In the basaltic cities of the Hauran, where the doors are of thick stone, they move easily on these pins. I found them also in the official (not the temple)City of Palmyra, but all broken.
 The effect of the poison and of the incantation which accompanied it.
 King Omar who had raped her. My sympathies are all with the old woman who nightly punished the royal lecher.
 Arab. ""Zunnár,"" the Gr. . Christians and Jews were compelled by the fanatical sumptuary laws of the Caliph Al- Mutawakkil (AD. 856) to wear a broad leather belt in public, hence it became a badge of the Faith. Probably it was confounded with the ""Janeo"" (Brahmanical thread) and the Parsi sacred girdle called Kashti. (Dabistan i, 297, etc.). Both Mandeville and La Brocquière speak of ""Christians of the Girdle, because they are all girt above,"" intending Jacobites or Nestorians.
 ""Siláh dár"" (Arab. and Pers.)=a military officer of high rank; literally an ""armour-bearer,"" chosen for velour and trustworthiness. So Jonathan had a ""young man"" (brave) who bare his armour (I Sam. xiv. 1, 6 and 7); and Goliath had a man that bare the shield before him (ibid. xvii. 7, 41). Men will not readily forget the name of Sulayman Agha, called the Silahdar, in Egypt. (Lane M. E. chaps. iv.)
 It will be told afterwards.
 The elder brother thus showed himself a vassal and proved himself a good Moslem by not having recourse to civil war.
 Arab. ""Ghazwah,"" the corrupt Gallicism, now
Europeanised=raid, foray.
 Turk in modern parlance means a Turkoman, a pomade: the settled people call themselves Osmanli or Othmanli. Turkoman=Turk- like.
 Arab. ""Nimsá;"" southern Germans, Austrians; from the Slav. ""Nemica"" (any Germans), literally meaning ""The dumb"" (nemac), because they cannot speak Slav.
 Arab. ""Dubárá"" from the Slav. ""Dubrovnik,"" from ""Dub"" (an oak) and ""Dubrava"" (an oak forest). Ragusa, once a rival of Venice, gave rise to the word ""Argosy."" D'Herbelot calls it ""Dobravenedik"" or ""Good Venice,"" the Turkish name, because it paid tribute when Venice would not (?).
 Arab. ""Jawarnah,"" or, ""Júrnah"" evidently Zara, a place of many names, Jadera (Hirtius de Bell. Alex. cap. 13), Jadra, Zadra (whence the modern term), Diadora, Diadosca and Jadrossa. This important Liburnian city sent forth many cruisers in crusading days; hence the Arabs came to know its name.
 Arab. ""Banu'l-Asfar;"" which may mean ""Pale faces,"" in the sense of ""yeller girls"" (New Orleans) and that intended by North American Indians, or, possibly, the peoples with yellow (or rather tow-coloured) hair we now call Russians. The races of Hindostan term the English not ""white men,"" but ""red men;"" and the reason will at once be seen by comparing a Britisher with a high-caste Nágar Brahman whose face is of parchment colour as if he had drunk exsangue cuminum. The Yellow-faces of the text correspond with the Sansk. ""Svetadvipa""—Whiteman's Land.
 Arab. ""Al-Musakhkham."" No Moslem believes that Isa was crucified and a favourite fancy is that Judas, changed to the likeness of Jesus, thus paid for his treason. (Evangel. Barnabæ.) Hence the resurrection is called not ""Kiyámah"" but ""Kumámah""=rubbish. This heresy about the Cross they share with the Docetes, ""certain beasts in the shape of men"" (says Ignatius), who held that a phantom was crucified. So far the Moslems are logical, for ""Isa,"" being angelically, miraculously and immaculately conceived, could not be; but they contradict themselves when they hold a vacant place near Mohammed's tomb for the body of Isa after his second coming as a forerunner to Mohammed and Doomday. (Pilgrimage ii. 89.)
 A diviner, priest, esp. Jewish, and not belonging to the tribe of Levi.
 Again the coarsest word ""Khara."" The allusion is to the
vulgar saying, ""Thou eatest skite!"" (i.e. thou talkest nonsense).
Decent English writers modify this to, ""Thou eatest dirt:"" and Lord
Beaconsfield made it ridiculous by turning it into ""eating sand.""
 These silly scandals, which cause us only to smile, excite
Easterns to fury. I have seen a Moslem wild with rage on hearing a
Christian parody the opening words of the Koran, ""Bismillahi 'l-
Rahmáni 'l-Rahím, Mismish wa Kamar al-din,"" roughly translated,
""In the name of Allah, the Compassionating, the Compassionate! Apricots and marmalede."" The idea of the Holy Merde might have been suggested by the Hindus: see Mandeville, of the archiprotopapaton (prelate) carrying ox-dung and urine to the King, who therewith anoints his brow and breast, &c. And, incredible to relate, this is still practiced after a fashion by the Parsis, one of the most progressive and the sharpest witted of Asiatic races.
 Meaning that he had marked his brow with a cross (of ashes?) as certain do on Ash Wednesday.
 Syria, the ""left-hand land"" as has before been explained. The popular saying about its people is ""Shámi shúmi!""—the Syrian is small potatoes (to render the sense Americanicè). Nor did Syrus, the slave in Roman days, bear the best of names. In Al-Hijaz the Syrian is addressed ""Abú Shám"" (Father of Syria) and insulted as ""Abuser of the Salt"" (a traitor). Yet many sayings of Mohammed are recorded in honour of Syria, and he sometimes used Syriac words. Such were ""Bakh, bakh"" (=euge, before noticed), and ""Kakh,"" a congener of the Latin Cacus and Caca which our day has docked to ""cack."" (Pilgrimage iii. 115)
 Koran xiv. 34. ""They (Unbelievers) shall be thrown therein (i.e., the House of Perdition=Hell); and an unhappy dwelling shall it be.""
 The leg-cut is a prime favourite with the Eastern Sworder, and a heavy two-handed blade easily severs a horse's leg.
 Mohammed repeatedly declared (Koran lxi.) that the Christians had falsified the passage (""I go to my Father and the Paraclete shall come,"" John xvi. 7) promising the advent of the Comforter, (ibid. xiv. 20; xv. 26) by substituting the latter word for glorious, renowned, i.e., Ahmed or Mohammed=the praised one. This may have been found in the Arabic translation of the Gospels made by Warakah, cousin to Mohammed's first wife; and hence in Koran lxi. we find Jesus prophesying of an Apostle ""whose name shall be Ahmad."" The word has consequently been inserted into the Arabic Gospel of Saint Barnabas (Dabistan iii. 67). Moslems accept the Pentateuch, the Psalter and the Gospel; but assert (Koran, passim.) that all extant copies have been hopelessly corrupted, and they are right. Moses, to whom the Pentateuch is attributed, notices his own death and burial—""the mair the miracle,"" said the old Scotch lady. The ""Psalms of David"" range over a period of some five hundred years, and there are three Isaiahs who pass with the vulgar for one. The many apocryphal Gospels, all of which have been held genuine and canonical at different times and in different places, prove that the four, which are still in use, were retained because they lack the manifest absurdities of their discarded rivals.
 Arab. "" Labbayka; "" the Pilgrimage-cry (Night xxii.) which in Arabic is,
Labbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!
Lá Sharíka lake, Labbayk'!
Inna 'l-hamda w'al ni'amata lake wa'l mulk!
Labbayk' Allahumma, Labbayk'!
Some add ""Here am I, and I honour Thee, the son of Thy two slaves; beneficence and good are all between Thy hands.""With the ""Talbiyah"" the pilgrims should bless the Prophet, pray Allah to grant Heaven and exclaim, ""By Thy mercy spare us from the pains of Hell-fire!"" (Pilgrimage iii. 232.) Labbayka occurs in the verses attributed to Caliph Ali; so labba=he faced, and yalubbu=it faces (as one house faces another); lastly, he professed submission to Allah; in which sense, together with the verbal noun ""Talbiyah,"" it is used by Al- Hanri (Pref. and Ass. of Su'adah).
 Arab. ""Kissís"" (plur. Kusús) from .
 Koran ii. The ""red cow"" is evidently the ""red heifer"" of
Barnabas, chaps. vii.
 Arab. ""Al-Jásalík""= .
 This is from the first ""Gospel of Infancy,"" wherein Jesus said to his mother, ""Verily I am Jesus, the Son of God, the Word which thou hast brought forth, as the Angel Gabriel did declare unto thee; and my Father hath sent me to save the world"" (chaps. i. 2.). The passage is virtually quoted in the Koran (chaps. iii. 141), of course omitting "" the Son of God""
 Mohammed allowed his locks to grow down to his ear-lobes but never lower.
 Arab. ""Lisám"" I have explained as a covering for the lower face, made by drawing over it the corner of the head-kerchief (Pilgrimage i. 346). The Lisám of the African Tawárik hoods the eyes so that a man must turn up his face to see, and swathes all the lower half, leaving only the nose exposed. And this is worn by many men by night as well as by day, doubtless to avoid the evil eye. The native Sultans of Darfur, like those of Bornu and others further west, used white muslin as a face-wrap: hence, too, the ceremonies when spitting, etc., etc. The Kúfiyah or head-kerchief of the Arabs soon reached Europe and became in Low Latin Cuphia; in Spanish Escofia; in Ital. Cuffia or Scuffia; in French Escoffion, Scofion (Reine Marguerite) Coëffe (une pellicule, marque de bonheur) Coiffe and Coife, &c.; the Scotch Curch or Coif, opposed to the maiden snood, and, lastly our Sergeant-at-Law's Coif. Littré, the Learned, who in erudition was né coiffé, has missed this obvious derivation.
 ""Cutting,"" throughout the book, alludes to the scymitar with which Arabs never give point; and ""thrusting"" to the footman's spear and the horseman's lance.
 A popular phrase, I repeat, for extreme tenor and consternation.
 The name usually applies to a well-known district and city of Al Yaman, where ""Koss the eloquent"" was bishop in Mohammed's day: the Negiran of D'Herbelot. Here, however, it is the Syrian Najrán (Nejrân of Missionary Porter's miserable Handbook), now a wretched village near the volcanic Lajjá, about one hundred and twenty miles direct south of Damascus and held by Druzes and Christians.
 The Kantár (quintal) of 100 ratls (Ibs.) =98-99 Ibs. avoir.
 Arab. ""Juráb (bag) mi'adat- ih (of his belly),"" the ""curdling of the testicles"" in fear is often mentioned.
 Clearly alluding to the magic so deeply studied by mediæval Jews.
 Arab. ""Sahákah,"" lit. rubbing. The Moslem Harem is a great school for this ""Lesbian (which I would call Atossan) love ""; but the motive of the practice lies deeper. As amongst men the mixture of the feminine with the masculine temperament leads to sodomy, so the reverse makes women prefer their own sex. These tribades are mostly known by peculiarities of form and features, hairy cheeks and upper lips, gruff voices, hircine odour and the large projecting clitoris with erectile powers known to the Arabs as ""bazar"" hence Tabzír=circumcision or amputation of such clitoris. Burckhardt (Prov. 436) translates "" Bazarah"" by slut or wench. He adds "" it originally signifies the labia which the Cairenes also entice Zambúr and which are cut off in girlhood."" See also Lane, Lex. s.v.; Tabzír. Both writers confuse excision of the nymphæ with circumcision of the clitoris (Zambúr) Al-Siyúti (Kitab al-Izá' fi'Ilm al-Nikah) has a very interesting chapter on Sapphic venery, which is well known to Europe as proved by such works as ""Gamiani,"" and ""Anandria ou Confessions de Mademoiselle Sappho, avec la Clef,"" Lesbos, 1718. Onanism is fatally prevalent: in many Harems and girls' schools tallow candles and similar succedanea are vainly forbidden and bananas when detected are cut into four so as to be useless; of late years, however, China has sent some marvellous artificial phalli of stuffed bladder, horn and even caoutchouc, the latter material of course borrowed from Europe.
 This is considered a powerful aphrodisiac in the East. Hence male devotees are advised to avoid tile ""two reds,"" i.e. meat and wine; while the ""two reds,"" which corrupt women, are gold and saffron, that is perfumery. Hence also the saying of Mohammed:— ""Perfumes for men should have scent and not colour; for women should have colour and not scent."" (Mishkát al-Masábíh ii. 361.)

Badawi binds round his legs, I believe to keep off cramp.

 i.e. Men, angels and devils, the ""Triloka"" (triple people) of the Hindus. Alamín (plur.), never Alamayn (dual), is the Triregno denoted by the papal Tiara, the three Christian kingdoms being Heaven, Hell and Purgatory.
 Matrahinna or Mit-Rahinah is a well-known village near Memphis, the name being derived from the old Egyptian Minat-ro- hinnu, the port at the mouth of the canal. Let me remark that two of these three words, ""Minat"" and ""Ru,"" are still common in "" Aryan"" Persian.
 Kirámat, a sign, a prodigy, opposed to Mu'ujizah, a miracle wrought by a prophet. The Sufis explain this thaumaturgy by Allah changing something of Nature's ordinary course in favour of an especial worshipper, and, after a fashion, this is Catholic doctrine (See Dabistan, iii. 173).
 Koran, x. 25, ""until the earth receive its vesture and be adorned with various plants.""
 i.e. the young hair sprouting on the boy's cheek.

 That is the King of Constantinople.
 Cassia fistularis, a kind of carob: "" Shambar"" is the
Arab. form of the Persian "" Chambar.""
 Koran, ii. 149. Hence the vulgar idea that Martyrs are still alive in the flesh. See my Pilgrimage (ii. 110 and elsewhere) for the romantic and picturesque consequences of that belief. The Commentators (Jalál al-Dín, etc.) play tricks with the Koranic words, "" they (martyrs) are not dead but living"" (iii. 179) by placing the happy souls in the crops of green birds which eat of the fruits and drink of the waters of Paradise; whereas the reprobates and the (very) wicked are deposited in black birds which drain the sanies and the boiling waters of Hell. Amongst the Greeks a body remaining entire long after death suggests Anathema Maranatha: it is the contrary with Catholic Christians (Boccaccio iv. 5, of the Pot of Basil). Concerning this creed see Maundrell, Letter of 1698.
 Tor is ""Mount Sinai"" in the Koran (xcv. 1). I have only to repeat my opinion concerning the present site so called: ""It is evident that Jebel Serbal dates only from the early days of Coptic Christianity; that Jebel Musa, its Greek rival, rose after the visions of Helena in the fourth century; whilst the building of the Convent by Justinian belongs to A.D 527. Ras Safsáfah, its rival to the north, is an affair of yesterday, and may be called the invention of Robinson; and Jebel Katerina, to the south is the property of Rüppell"" (Midian Revisited i., 237). I would therefore call the ""Sinaitic"" Peninsula, Peninsula of Paran in old days and Peninsula of Tor (from its chief port) in our time. It is still my conviction that the true Mount Sinai will be found in Jabal Aráif, or some such unimportant height to the north of the modern Hajj- road from Suez to Akabah. Even about the name (which the Koran writes ""Sainá"" and ""Sínín"") there is a dispute: It is usually derived from the root ""Sanah""=sentis, a bush; but this is not satisfactory. Our eminent Assyriologist, Professor Sayce, would connect it with ""Sin,"" the Assyrian Moon- god as Mount Nebo with the Sun-god and he expects to find there the ruins of a Lunar temple as a Solar fane stands on Ba'al Zapuna (Baal Zephon) or the classical Mount Casius.
 Alluding to the miracle of Aaron's rod (the gift of Jethro) as related in the Koran (chapts. vii. 1., xx., etc.), where the Egyptian sorcerers threw down thick ropes which by their magic twisted and coiled like serpents.
 Arab. ""Ayát"" lit. ""signs,"" here ""miracles of the truth,"" 1. c. Koranic versets as opposed to chapters. The ranks of the enemy represent the latter, sword-cuts the former—a very persuasive mode of preaching.
 Lane (M. E. chapt.. iii.) shows by a sketch the position of the worshipper during this ""Salám"" which is addressed, some say, to the guardian angels, others suppose to all brother-believers and angels.
 i.e., where the Syrians found him.
 i.e., Dedianus Arabised; a name knightly and plebian.
 In such tales the Wazir is usually the sharp-witted man, contrasting with the ""dummy,"" or master.
 Carrier-pigeons were extensively used at this time. The Caliph Al-Násir li-Díni lláh (regn. A.H. 575=1180) was, according to Ibn Khaldún, very fond of them. The moderns of Damascus still affect them. My successor, Mr. Consul Kirby Green, wrote an excellent report on pigeon-fancying at Damascus. The so-called Maundeville or Mandeville in A. D. 1322 speaks of carrier-pigeons in Syria as a well-known mode Of intercourse between lord and lord.
 Mohammed who declared ""There is no monkery in Al-Islam,"" and who virtually abolished the priest, had an especial aversion to the shaveling (Ruhbán). But the ""Gens æterna in quâ nemo nascitur"" (Pliny v. 17) managed to appear even in Al-lslam, as Fakirs,, Dervishes, Súfis, etc. Of this more hereafter.
 i.e. her holiness would act like a fascinating talisman.
 The ""smoking out"" practice is common amongst the Arabs: hence Marshal Pelissier's so- called "" barbarity."" The Public is apt to forget that on a campaign the general's first duty is to save his own men by any practice which the laws of fair warfare do not absolutely forbid.
 i.e. Mohammed, who promised Heaven and threatened Hell.
 Arab. ""Ahr"" or ""ihr,"" fornication or adultery, i.e., irreligion, infidelity as amongst the Hebrews (Isaiah xxiii.17).
 A sign of defeat.
 In English ""last night"": I have already noted that the Moslem day, like the Jewish and the Scandinavian, begins at sundown; and ""layl "" a night, is often used to denote the twenty- four hours between sunset and sunset, whilst ""yaum,"" a day, would by us be translated in many cases ""battle-day.""
 Iterum the ""Himalayan Brothers.""
 Again, Mohammed who promised Good to the Good, and vice versâ.
 They are sad doggrel like most of the pièces d'occasion inserted in The Nights.
 Here ""Kahwah"" (coffee) is used in its original sense of strong old wine. The derivation is ""Akhá""=fastidire fecit, causing disinclination for food, the Matambre (kill- hunger) of the Iberians. In old days the scrupulous called coffee ""Kihwah"" in order to distinguish it from 'Kakwah,"" wine.
 i.e. Mohammed, a common title.
 That is, fatal to the scoffer and the impious.
 Equivalent to our ""The Devil was sick,"" etc.
 i.e. to the enemy: the North American Indians (so called) use similar forms of ""inverted speech""; and the Australian aborigines are in no way behind them.
 See Vol. i., p. 154 (Night xvi.).
 Arab. ""Sauf,"" a particle denoting a near future whereas
""Sa-"" points to one which may be very remote.
 From the root ""Shanh""=having a fascinating eye, terrifying. The Irish call the fascinater ""eybitter"" and the victim (who is also rhymed to death) ""eybitten.""
 i.e., not like the noble-born, strong in enduring the stress of fight.
 i.e., of Abraham. For the Well Zemzem and the Place of Abraham see my Pilgrimage (iii. 171-175, etc.), where I described the water as of salt-bitter taste, like that of Epsom (iii. 203). Sir William Muir (in his excellent life of Mahomet, I. cclviii.) remarks that ""the flavour of stale water bottled up for months would not be a criterion of the same water freshly drawn;"" but soldered tins-full of water drawn a fortnight before are to be had in Calcutta and elsewhere after Pilgrimage time; and analysis would at once detect the salt.
 Racing was and is a favourite pastime with those hippomanists, the Arabs; but it contrasts strongly with our civilised form being a trial of endurance rather than of speed. The Prophet is said to have limited betting in these words, ""There shall be no wagering save on the Kuff (camel's foot), the Hafir (hoof of horse, ass, etc.) or the Nasal (arrow-pile or lance head).""
 In the Mac. Edit. ""Arman""=Armenia, which has before occurred. The author or scribe here understands by ""Cæsarea"" not the old Turris Stratonis, Herod's city called after Augustus, but Cæsareia the capital of Cappadocia (Pliny, vi. 3), the royal residence before called Mazaca (Strabo).
 An idiom meaning ""a very fool.""
 i.e. Kána (was) má (that which) was (kána).
 A son being ""the lamp of a dark house.""
 When the Israelites refused to receive the Law (the souls of all the Prophets even those unborn being present at the Covenant), Allah tore up the mountain (Sinai which is not mentioned) by the roots and shook it over their heads to terrify them, saying, ""Receive the Law which we have given you with a resolution to keep it"" (Koran chaps. xlx. 170). Much of this story is from the Talmud (Abodah Sar. 2, 2, Tract Sabbath, etc.) whence Al-Islam borrowed so much of its Judaism, as it took Christianity from the Apocryphal New Testament. This tradition is still held by the Israelites, says Mr. Rodwell (p. 333) who refers it to a misunderstanding of Exod. xix. 17, rightly rendered in the E. version ""at the nether part of the mountain.""
 Arab. ""Azghán"" = the camel-litters in which women travel.
 i.e. to joy foes and dismay friends.
 Whose eyes became white (i.e. went blind) with mourning for his son Joseph (Koran, chaps. xii. 84). He recovered his sight when his face was covered with the shirt which Gabriel had given to the youth after his brethren had thrown him into the well."

Yeah, kings of New York.  Kayoz connect with Wise Eyez.  Live shit, direct hit.  Yo, load your clip

I’ll design each rhyme with pure facts, destroy tracks
Addictive like cracks and leave you open like gats
Ayyo, my eyes on stacks and different ways to get the fortune
Approach with caution.  My clique is known for holding often
The game is what I'm lost in, trapped in—there's no escaping
Strictly debating while I'm calculating what I'm making
Causing more Hell than Satan while I’ll function off corruption
Steady discussing while thugs continue busting
Forever stuck in a cold world as foul as this
I’ll often reminisce while I create numerous hits
Consistent like a TEC spits slugs hotter than Texas
Test with theft and leave you chest-less.  I'm young but restless
And quick to set shit, perfectly planned as if
The mauled pit, making sure moves remain cautious

Just sit back and listen.  I won't hesitate to blind your vision
NY, hard times is what I'm living

I. REPORT SUMMARY
The Civil Rights Division of the United States Department of Justice opened its investigation of the Ferguson Police Department (“FPD”) on September 4, 2014. This investigation was initiated under the pattern-or-practice provision of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 42 U.S.C. § 14141, the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. § 3789d (“Safe Streets Act”), and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000d (“Title VI”). This investigation has revealed a pattern or practice of unlawful conduct within the Ferguson Police Department that violates the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, and federal statutory law.
Over the course of the investigation, we interviewed City officials, including City Manager John Shaw, Mayor James Knowles, Chief of Police Thomas Jackson, Municipal Judge Ronald Brockmeyer, the Municipal Court Clerk, Ferguson’s Finance Director, half of FPD’s sworn officers, and others. We spent, collectively, approximately 100 person-days onsite in Ferguson. We participated in ride-alongs with on-duty officers, reviewed over 35,000 pages of police records as well as thousands of emails and other electronic materials provided by the police department. Enlisting the assistance of statistical experts, we analyzed FPD’s data on stops, searches, citations, and arrests, as well as data collected by the municipal court. We observed four separate sessions of Ferguson Municipal Court, interviewing dozens of people charged with local offenses, and we reviewed third-party studies regarding municipal court practices in Ferguson and St. Louis County more broadly. As in all of our investigations, we sought to engage the local community, conducting hundreds of in-person and telephone interviews of individuals who reside in Ferguson or who have had interactions with the police department. We contacted ten neighborhood associations and met with each group that responded to us, as well as several other community groups and advocacy organizations. Throughout the investigation, we relied on two police chiefs who accompanied us to Ferguson and who themselves interviewed City and police officials, spoke with community members, and reviewed FPD policies and incident reports.
We thank the City officials and the rank-and-file officers who have cooperated with this investigation and provided us with insights into the operation of the police department, including the municipal court. Notwithstanding our findings about Ferguson’s approach to law enforcement and the policing culture it creates, we found many Ferguson police officers and other City employees to be dedicated public servants striving each day to perform their duties lawfully and with respect for all members of the Ferguson community. The importance of their often-selfless work cannot be overstated.
We are also grateful to the many members of the Ferguson community who have met with us to share their experiences. It became clear during our many conversations with Ferguson residents from throughout the City that many residents, black and white, genuinely embrace Ferguson’s diversity and want to reemerge from the events of recent months a truly inclusive, united community. This Report is intended to strengthen those efforts by recognizing the harms caused by Ferguson’s law enforcement practices so that those harms can be better understood and overcome.
2
Ferguson’s law enforcement practices are shaped by the City’s focus on revenue rather than by public safety needs. This emphasis on revenue has compromised the institutional character of Ferguson’s police department, contributing to a pattern of unconstitutional policing, and has also shaped its municipal court, leading to procedures that raise due process concerns and inflict unnecessary harm on members of the Ferguson community. Further, Ferguson’s police and municipal court practices both reflect and exacerbate existing racial bias, including racial stereotypes. Ferguson’s own data establish clear racial disparities that adversely impact African Americans. The evidence shows that discriminatory intent is part of the reason for these disparities. Over time, Ferguson’s police and municipal court practices have sown deep mistrust between parts of the community and the police department, undermining law enforcement legitimacy among African Americans in particular.
Focus on Generating Revenue
The City budgets for sizeable increases in municipal fines and fees each year, exhorts police and court staff to deliver those revenue increases, and closely monitors whether those increases are achieved. City officials routinely urge Chief Jackson to generate more revenue through enforcement. In March 2010, for instance, the City Finance Director wrote to Chief Jackson that “unless ticket writing ramps up significantly before the end of the year, it will be hard to significantly raise collections next year. . . . Given that we are looking at a substantial sales tax shortfall, it’s not an insignificant issue.” Similarly, in March 2013, the Finance Director wrote to the City Manager: “Court fees are anticipated to rise about 7.5%. I did ask the Chief if he thought the PD could deliver 10% increase. He indicated they could try.” The importance of focusing on revenue generation is communicated to FPD officers. Ferguson police officers from all ranks told us that revenue generation is stressed heavily within the police department, and that the message comes from City leadership. The evidence we reviewed supports this perception.
Police Practices
The City’s emphasis on revenue generation has a profound effect on FPD’s approach to law enforcement. Patrol assignments and schedules are geared toward aggressive enforcement of Ferguson’s municipal code, with insufficient thought given to whether enforcement strategies promote public safety or unnecessarily undermine community trust and cooperation. Officer evaluations and promotions depend to an inordinate degree on “productivity,” meaning the number of citations issued. Partly as a consequence of City and FPD priorities, many officers appear to see some residents, especially those who live in Ferguson’s predominantly African-American neighborhoods, less as constituents to be protected than as potential offenders and sources of revenue.
This culture within FPD influences officer activities in all areas of policing, beyond just ticketing. Officers expect and demand compliance even when they lack legal authority. They are inclined to interpret the exercise of free-speech rights as unlawful disobedience, innocent movements as physical threats, indications of mental or physical illness as belligerence. Police supervisors and leadership do too little to ensure that officers act in accordance with law and policy, and rarely respond meaningfully to civilian complaints of officer misconduct. The result is a pattern of stops without reasonable suspicion and arrests without probable cause in violation of the Fourth Amendment; infringement on free expression, as well as retaliation for protected expression, in violation of the First Amendment; and excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
Even relatively routine misconduct by Ferguson police officers can have significant consequences for the people whose rights are violated. For example, in the summer of 2012, a 32-year-old African-American man sat in his car cooling off after playing basketball in a Ferguson public park. An officer pulled up behind the man’s car, blocking him in, and demanded the man’s Social Security number and identification. Without any cause, the officer accused the man of being a pedophile, referring to the presence of children in the park, and ordered the man out of his car for a pat-down, although the officer had no reason to believe the man was armed. The officer also asked to search the man’s car. The man objected, citing his constitutional rights. In response, the officer arrested the man, reportedly at gunpoint, charging him with eight violations of Ferguson’s municipal code. One charge, Making a False Declaration, was for initially providing the short form of his first name (e.g., “Mike” instead of “Michael”), and an address which, although legitimate, was different from the one on his driver’s license. Another charge was for not wearing a seat belt, even though he was seated in a parked car. The officer also charged the man both with having an expired operator’s license, and with having no operator’s license in his possession. The man told us that, because of these charges, he lost his job as a contractor with the federal government that he had held for years.
Municipal Court Practices
Ferguson has allowed its focus on revenue generation to fundamentally compromise the role of Ferguson’s municipal court. The municipal court does not act as a neutral arbiter of the law or a check on unlawful police conduct. Instead, the court primarily uses its judicial authority as the means to compel the payment of fines and fees that advance the City’s financial interests. This has led to court practices that violate the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process and equal protection requirements. The court’s practices also impose unnecessary harm, overwhelmingly on African-American individuals, and run counter to public safety.
Most strikingly, the court issues municipal arrest warrants not on the basis of public safety needs, but rather as a routine response to missed court appearances and required fine payments. In 2013 alone, the court issued over 9,000 warrants on cases stemming in large part from minor violations such as parking infractions, traffic tickets, or housing code violations. Jail time would be considered far too harsh a penalty for the great majority of these code violations, yet Ferguson’s municipal court routinely issues warrants for people to be arrested and incarcerated for failing to timely pay related fines and fees. Under state law, a failure to appear in municipal court on a traffic charge involving a moving violation also results in a license suspension. Ferguson has made this penalty even more onerous by only allowing the suspension to be lifted after payment of an owed fine is made in full. Further, until recently, Ferguson also added charges, fines, and fees for each missed appearance and payment. Many pending cases still include such charges that were imposed before the court recently eliminated them, making it as difficult as before for people to resolve these cases.
The court imposes these severe penalties for missed appearances and payments even as several of the court’s practices create unnecessary barriers to resolving a municipal violation. The court often fails to provide clear and accurate information regarding a person’s charges or court obligations. And the court’s fine assessment procedures do not adequately provide for a defendant to seek a fine reduction on account of financial incapacity or to seek alternatives to payment such as community service. City and court officials have adhered to these court practices despite acknowledging their needlessly harmful consequences. In August 2013, for example, one City Councilmember wrote to the City Manager, the Mayor, and other City officials lamenting the lack of a community service option and noted the benefits of such a program, including that it would “keep those people that simply don’t have the money to pay their fines from constantly being arrested and going to jail, only to be released and do it all over again.”
Together, these court practices exacerbate the harm of Ferguson’s unconstitutional police practices. They impose a particular hardship upon Ferguson’s most vulnerable residents, especially upon those living in or near poverty. Minor offenses can generate crippling debts, result in jail time because of an inability to pay, and result in the loss of a driver’s license, employment, or housing.
We spoke, for example, with an African-American woman who has a still-pending case stemming from 2007, when, on a single occasion, she parked her car illegally. She received two citations and a $151 fine, plus fees. The woman, who experienced financial difficulties and periods of homelessness over several years, was charged with seven Failure to Appear offenses for missing court dates or fine payments on her parking tickets between 2007 and 2010. For each Failure to Appear, the court issued an arrest warrant and imposed new fines and fees. From 2007 to 2014, the woman was arrested twice, spent six days in jail, and paid $550 to the court for the events stemming from this single instance of illegal parking. Court records show that she twice attempted to make partial payments of $25 and $50, but the court returned those payments, refusing to accept anything less than payment in full. One of those payments was later accepted, but only after the court’s letter rejecting payment by money order was returned as undeliverable. This woman is now making regular payments on the fine. As of December 2014, over seven years later, despite initially owing a $151 fine and having already paid $550, she still owed $541.
Racial Bias
Ferguson’s approach to law enforcement both reflects and reinforces racial bias, including stereotyping. The harms of Ferguson’s police and court practices are borne disproportionately by African Americans, and there is evidence that this is due in part to intentional discrimination on the basis of race.
Ferguson’s law enforcement practices overwhelmingly impact African Americans. Data collected by the Ferguson Police Department from 2012 to 2014 shows that African Americans account for 85% of vehicle stops, 90% of citations, and 93% of arrests made by FPD officers, despite comprising only 67% of Ferguson’s population. African Americans are more than twice as likely as white drivers to be searched during vehicle stops even after controlling for non-race based variables such as the reason the vehicle stop was initiated, but are found in possession of contraband 26% less often than white drivers, suggesting officers are impermissibly considering race as a factor when determining whether to search. African Americans are more likely to be cited and arrested following a stop regardless of why the stop was initiated and are more likely to receive multiple citations during a single incident. From 2012 to 2014, FPD issued four or more citations to African Americans on 73 occasions, but issued four or more citations to non-African Americans only twice. FPD appears to bring certain offenses almost exclusively against African Americans. For example, from 2011 to 2013, African Americans accounted for 95% of Manner of Walking in Roadway charges, and 94% of all Failure to Comply charges. Notably, with respect to speeding charges brought by FPD, the evidence shows not only that African Americans are represented at disproportionately high rates overall, but also that the disparate impact of FPD’s enforcement practices on African Americans is 48% larger when citations are issued not on the basis of radar or laser, but by some other method, such as the officer’s own visual assessment.
These disparities are also present in FPD’s use of force. Nearly 90% of documented force used by FPD officers was used against African Americans. In every canine bite incident for which racial information is available, the person bitten was African American.
Municipal court practices likewise cause disproportionate harm to African Americans. African Americans are 68% less likely than others to have their cases dismissed by the court, and are more likely to have their cases last longer and result in more required court encounters. African Americans are at least 50% more likely to have their cases lead to an arrest warrant, and accounted for 92% of cases in which an arrest warrant was issued by the Ferguson Municipal Court in 2013. Available data show that, of those actually arrested by FPD only because of an outstanding municipal warrant, 96% are African American.
Our investigation indicates that this disproportionate burden on African Americans cannot be explained by any difference in the rate at which people of different races violate the law. Rather, our investigation has revealed that these disparities occur, at least in part, because of unlawful bias against and stereotypes about African Americans. We have found substantial evidence of racial bias among police and court staff in Ferguson. For example, we discovered emails circulated by police supervisors and court staff that stereotype racial minorities as criminals, including one email that joked about an abortion by an African-American woman being a means of crime control.
City officials have frequently asserted that the harsh and disparate results of Ferguson’s law enforcement system do not indicate problems with police or court practices, but instead reflect a pervasive lack of “personal responsibility” among “certain segments” of the community. Our investigation has found that the practices about which area residents have complained are in fact unconstitutional and unduly harsh. But the City’s personal-responsibility refrain is telling: it reflects many of the same racial stereotypes found in the emails between police and court supervisors. This evidence of bias and stereotyping, together with evidence that Ferguson has long recognized but failed to correct the consistent racial disparities caused by its police and court practices, demonstrates that the discriminatory effects of Ferguson’s conduct are driven at least in part by discriminatory intent in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.
Community Distrust
Since the August 2014 shooting death of Michael Brown, the lack of trust between the Ferguson Police Department and a significant portion of Ferguson’s residents, especially African Americans, has become undeniable. The causes of this distrust and division, however, have been the subject of debate. Police and other City officials, as well as some Ferguson residents, have insisted to us that the public outcry is attributable to “outside agitators” who do not reflect the opinions of “real Ferguson residents.” That view is at odds with the facts we have gathered during our investigation. Our investigation has shown that distrust of the Ferguson Police Department is longstanding and largely attributable to Ferguson’s approach to law enforcement. This approach results in patterns of unnecessarily aggressive and at times unlawful policing; reinforces the harm of discriminatory stereotypes; discourages a culture of accountability; and neglects community engagement. In recent years, FPD has moved away from the modest community policing efforts it previously had implemented, reducing opportunities for positive police-community interactions, and losing the little familiarity it had with some African-American neighborhoods. The confluence of policing to raise revenue and racial bias thus has resulted in practices that not only violate the Constitution and cause direct harm to the individuals whose rights are violated, but also undermine community trust, especially among many African Americans. As a consequence of these practices, law enforcement is seen as illegitimate, and the partnerships necessary for public safety are, in some areas, entirely absent.
Restoring trust in law enforcement will require recognition of the harms caused by Ferguson’s law enforcement practices, and diligent, committed collaboration with the entire Ferguson community. At the conclusion of this report, we have broadly identified the changes that are necessary for meaningful and sustainable reform. These measures build upon a number of other recommended changes we communicated verbally to the Mayor, Police Chief, and City Manager in September so that Ferguson could begin immediately to address problems as we identified them. As a result of those recommendations, the City and police department have already begun to make some changes to municipal court and police practices. We commend City officials for beginning to take steps to address some of the concerns we have already raised. Nonetheless, these changes are only a small part of the reform necessary. Addressing the deeply embedded constitutional deficiencies we found demands an entire reorientation of law enforcement in Ferguson. The City must replace revenue-driven policing with a system grounded in the principles of community policing and police legitimacy, in which people are equally protected and treated with compassion, regardless of race.
II. BACKGROUND
The City of Ferguson is one of 89 municipalities in St. Louis County, Missouri.1 According to United States Census Data from 2010, Ferguson is home to roughly 21,000 residents.2 While Ferguson’s total population has stayed relatively constant in recent decades, Ferguson’s racial demographics have changed dramatically during that time. In 1990, 74% of Ferguson’s population was white, while 25% was black.3 By 2000, African Americans became the new majority, making up 52% of the City’s population.4 According to the 2010 Census, the black population in Ferguson has grown to 67%, whereas the white population has decreased to 29%.5 According to the 2009-2013 American Community Survey, 25% of the City’s population lives below the federal poverty level.6

6 See Poverty Status in the Past 12 Months 2009-2013 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, U.S. Census Bureau (2014), available at Residents of Ferguson elect a Mayor and six individuals to serve on a City Council. The City Council appoints a City Manager to an indefinite term, subject to removal by a Council vote. See Ferguson City Charter § 4.1. The City Manager serves as chief executive and administrative officer of the City of Ferguson, and is responsible for all affairs of the City. The City Manager directs and supervises all City departments, including the Ferguson Police Department.
The current Chief of Police, Thomas Jackson, has commanded the police department since he was appointed by the City Manager in 2010. The department has a total of 54 sworn officers divided among several divisions. The patrol division is the largest division; 28 patrol officers are supervised by four sergeants, two lieutenants, and a captain. Each of the four patrol squads has a canine officer. While all patrol officers engage in traffic enforcement, FPD also has a dedicated traffic officer responsible for collecting traffic stop data required by the state of Missouri. FPD has two School Resource Officers (“SROs”), one who is assigned to the McCluer South-Berkeley High School and one who is assigned to the Ferguson Middle School. FPD has a single officer assigned to be the “Community Resource Officer,” who attends community meetings, serves as FPD’s public relations liaison, and is charged with collecting crime data. FPD operates its own jail, which has ten individual cells and a large holding cell. The jail is staffed by three non-sworn correctional officers. Of the 54 sworn officers currently serving in FPD, four are African American.
FPD officers are authorized to initiate charges—by issuing citations or summonses, or by making arrests—under both the municipal code and state law. Ferguson’s municipal code addresses nearly every aspect of civic life for those who live in Ferguson, and regulates the conduct of all who work, travel through, or otherwise visit the City. In addition to mirroring some non-felony state law violations, such as assault, stealing, and traffic violations, the code establishes housing violations, such as High Grass and Weeds; requirements for permits to rent an apartment or use the City’s trash service; animal control ordinances, such as Barking Dog and Dog Running at Large; and a number of other violations, such as Manner of Walking in Roadway. See, e.g., Ferguson Mun. Code §§ 29-16 et seq.; 37-1 et seq.; 46-27; 6-5, 6-11; 44-344.
FPD files most charges as municipal offenses, not state violations, even when an analogous state offense exists. Between July 1, 2010, and June 30, 2014, the City of Ferguson issued approximately 90,000 citations and summonses for municipal violations. Notably, the City issued nearly 50% more citations in the last year of that time period than it did in the first. This increase in enforcement has not been driven by a rise in serious crime. While the ticketing rate has increased dramatically, the number of charges for many of the most serious offenses covered by the municipal code—e.g., Assault, Driving While Intoxicated, and Stealing—has remained relatively constant.7
http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/ACS/13_5YR/S1701/1600000US2923986 (last visited Feb. 26, 2015).
7 This is evidenced not only by FPD’s own records, but also by Uniform Crime Reports data for Ferguson, which show a downward trend in serious crime over the last ten years. See Uniform Crime Reports, Federal Bureau of Investigation, http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s (last visited Feb. 26, 2015). Because the overwhelming majority of FPD’s enforcement actions are brought under the municipal code, most charges are processed and resolved by the Ferguson Municipal Court, which has primary jurisdiction over all code violations. Ferguson Mun. Code § 13-2. Ferguson’s municipal court operates as part of the police department. The court is supervised by the Ferguson Chief of Police, is considered part of the police department for City organizational purposes, and is physically located within the police station. Court staff report directly to the Chief of Police. Thus, if the City Manager or other City officials issue a court-related directive, it is typically sent to the Police Chief’s attention. In recent weeks, City officials informed us that they are considering plans to bring the court under the supervision of the City Finance Director.
A Municipal Judge presides over court sessions. The Municipal Judge is not hired or supervised by the Chief of Police, but is instead nominated by the City Manager and elected by the City Council. The Judge serves a two-year term, subject to reappointment. The current Municipal Judge, Ronald Brockmeyer, has presided in Ferguson for approximately ten years. The City’s Prosecuting Attorney and her assistants officially prosecute all actions before the court, although in practice most cases are resolved without trial or a prosecutor’s involvement. The current Prosecuting Attorney was appointed in April 2011. At the time of her appointment, the Prosecuting Attorney was already serving as City Attorney, and she continues to serve in that separate capacity, which entails providing general counsel and representation to the City. The Municipal Judge, Court Clerk, Prosecuting Attorney, and all assistant court clerks are white.
While the Municipal Judge presides over court sessions, the Court Clerk, who is employed under the Police Chief’s supervision, plays the most significant role in managing the court and exercises broad discretion in conducting the court’s daily operations. Ferguson’s municipal code confers broad authority on the Court Clerk, including the authority to collect all fines and fees, accept guilty pleas, sign and issue subpoenas, and approve bond determinations. Ferguson Mun. Code § 13-7. Indeed, the Court Clerk and assistant clerks routinely perform duties that are, for all practical purposes, judicial. For example, documents indicate that court clerks have disposed of charges without the Municipal Judge’s involvement.
The court officially operates subject to the oversight of the presiding judge of the St. Louis County Circuit Court (21st Judicial Circuit) under the rules promulgated by that Circuit Court and the Missouri Supreme Court. Notwithstanding these rules, the City of Ferguson and the court itself retain considerable power to establish and amend court practices and procedures. The Ferguson municipal code sets forth a limited number of protocols that the court must follow, but the code leaves most aspects of court operations to the discretion of the court itself. See Ferguson Mun. Code Ch. 13, Art. III. The code also explicitly authorizes the Municipal Judge to “make and adopt such rules of practice and procedure as are necessary to hear and decide matters pending before the municipal court.” Ferguson Mun. Code § 13-29.
The Ferguson Municipal Court has the authority to issue and enforce judgments, issue warrants for search and arrest, hold parties in contempt, and order imprisonment as a penalty for contempt. The court may conduct trials, although it does so rarely, and most charges are resolved without one. Upon resolution of a charge, the court has the authority to impose fines, fees, and imprisonment when violations are found. Specifically, the court can impose imprisonment in the Ferguson City Jail for up to three months, a fine of up to $1,000, or a combination thereof. It is rare for the court to sentence anyone to jail as a penalty for a violation of the municipal code; indeed, the Municipal Judge reports that he has done so only once.
Rather, the court almost always imposes a monetary penalty payable to the City of Ferguson, plus court fees. Nonetheless, as discussed in detail below, the court issues arrest warrants when a person misses a court appearance or fails to timely pay a fine. As a result, violations that would normally not result in a penalty of imprisonment can, and frequently do, lead to municipal warrants, arrests, and jail time.
As the number of charges initiated by FPD has increased in recent years, the size of the court’s docket has also increased. According to data the City reported to the Missouri State Courts Administrator, at the end of fiscal year 2009, the municipal court had roughly 24,000 traffic cases and 28,000 non-traffic cases pending. As of October 31, 2014, both of those figures had roughly doubled to 53,000 and 50,000 cases, respectively. In fiscal year 2009, 16,178 new cases were filed, and 8,727 were resolved. In 2014, by contrast, 24,256 new offenses were filed, and 10,975 offenses were resolved.
The court holds three or four sessions per month, and each session lasts no more than three hours. It is not uncommon for as many as 500 people to appear before the court in a single session, exceeding the court’s physical capacity and leading individuals to line up outside of court waiting to be heard. Many people have multiple offenses pending; accordingly, the court typically considers 1,200-1,500 offenses in a single session, and has in the past considered over 2,000 offenses during one sitting. Previously there was a cap on the number of offenses that could be assigned to a particular docket date. Given that cap, and the significant increase in municipal citations in recent years, a problem developed in December 2011 in which more citations were issued than court sessions could timely accommodate. At one point court dates were initially scheduled as far as six months after the date of the citation. To address this problem, court staff first raised the cap to allow 1,000 offenses to be assigned to a single court date and later eliminated the cap altogether. To handle the increasing caseload, the City Manager also requested and secured City Council approval to fund additional court positions, noting in January 2013 that “each month we are setting new all-time records in fines and forfeitures,” that this was overburdening court staff, and that the funding for the additional positions “will be more than covered by the increase in revenues.”
III. FERGUSON LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED ON GENERATING REVENUE
City officials have consistently set maximizing revenue as the priority for Ferguson’s law enforcement activity. Ferguson generates a significant and increasing amount of revenue from the enforcement of code provisions. The City has budgeted for, and achieved, significant increases in revenue from municipal code enforcement over the last several years, and these increases are projected to continue. Of the $11.07 million in general fund revenue the City collected in fiscal year 2010, $1.38 million came from fines and fees collected by the court; similarly, in fiscal year 2011, the City’s general fund revenue of $11.44 million included $1.41 million from fines and fees. In its budget for fiscal year 2012, however, the City predicted that revenue from municipal fines and fees would increase over 30% from the previous year’s amount to $1.92 million; the court exceeded that target, collecting $2.11 million. In its budget for fiscal year 2013, the City budgeted for fines and fees to yield $2.11 million; the court exceeded that target as well, collecting $2.46 million. For 2014, the City budgeted for the municipal court to generate $2.63 million in revenue. The City has not yet made public the actual revenue collected that year, although budget documents forecasted lower revenue than was budgeted. Nonetheless, for fiscal year 2015, the City’s budget anticipates fine and fee revenues to account for $3.09 million of a projected $13.26 million in general fund revenues.
City, police, and court officials for years have worked in concert to maximize revenue at every stage of the enforcement process, beginning with how fines and fine enforcement processes are established. In a February 2011 report requested by the City Council at a Financial Planning Session and drafted by Ferguson’s Finance Director with contributions from Chief Jackson, the Finance Director reported on “efforts to increase efficiencies and maximize collection” by the municipal court. The report included an extensive comparison of Ferguson’s fines to those of surrounding municipalities and noted with approval that Ferguson’s fines are “at or near the top of the list.” The chart noted, for example, that while other municipalities’ parking fines generally range from $5 to $100, Ferguson’s is $102. The chart noted also that the charge for “Weeds/Tall Grass” was as little as $5 in one city but, in Ferguson, it ranged from $77 to $102. The report stated that the acting prosecutor had reviewed the City’s “high volume offenses” and “started recommending higher fines on these cases, and recommending probation only infrequently.” While the report stated that this recommendation was because of a “large volume of non-compliance,” the recommendation was in fact emphasized as one of several ways that the code enforcement system had been honed to produce more revenue.
In combination with a high fine schedule, the City directs FPD to aggressively enforce the municipal code. City and police leadership pressure officers to write citations, independent of any public safety need, and rely on citation productivity to fund the City budget. In an email from March 2010, the Finance Director wrote to Chief Jackson that “unless ticket writing ramps up significantly before the end of the year, it will be hard to significantly raise collections next year. What are your thoughts? Given that we are looking at a substantial sales tax shortfall, it’s not an insignificant issue.” Chief Jackson responded that the City would see an increase in fines once more officers were hired and that he could target the $1.5 million forecast. Significantly, Chief Jackson stated that he was also “looking at different shift schedules which will place more officers on the street, which in turn will increase traffic enforcement per shift.” Shortly thereafter, FPD switched to the 12-hour shift schedule for its patrol officers, which FPD continues to use. Law enforcement experience has shown that this schedule makes community policing more difficult—a concern that we have also heard directly from FPD officers. Nonetheless, while FPD heavily considered the revenue implications of the 12-hour shift and certain other factors such as its impact on overtime and sick time usage, we have found no evidence that FPD considered the consequences for positive community engagement. The City’s 2014 budget itself stated that since December 2010, “the percent of  resources allocated to traffic enforcement has increased,” and “s a result, traffic enforcement related collections increased” in the following two years. The 2015 budget added that even after those initial increases, in fiscal year 2012-2013, FPD was once again “successful in increasing their proportion of resources dedicated to traffic enforcement” and increasing collections.
8 Each of these yearly totals excludes certain court fees that are designated for particular purposes, but that nonetheless are paid directly to the City. For example, $2 of the court fee that accompanies every citation for a municipal code violation is set aside to be used for police training. That fee is used only by the City of Ferguson and is deposited in the City’s general fund; nonetheless, the City’s budget does not include that fee in its totals for “municipal court” revenue. In 2012 and 2013, the police training fee brought in, respectively, another $24,724 and $22,938 in revenue.
11
As directed, FPD supervisors and line officers have undertaken the aggressive code enforcement required to meet the City’s revenue generation expectations. As discussed below in Part III.A., FPD officers routinely conduct stops that have little relation to public safety and a questionable basis in law. FPD officers routinely issue multiple citations during a single stop, often for the same violation. Issuing three or four charges in one stop is not uncommon in Ferguson. Officers sometimes write six, eight, or, in at least one instance, fourteen citations for a single encounter. Indeed, officers told us that some compete to see who can issue the largest number of citations during a single stop.
The February 2011 report to the City Council notes that the acting prosecutor—with the apparent approval of the Police Chief—“talked with police officers about ensuring all necessary summonses are written for each incident, i.e. when DWI charges are issued, are the correct companion charges being issued, such as speeding, failure to maintain a single lane, no insurance, and no seat belt, etc.” The prosecutor noted that “his is done to ensure that a proper resolution to all cases is being achieved and that the court is maintaining the correct volume for offenses occurring within the city.” Notably, the “correct volume” of law enforcement is uniformly presented in City documents as related to revenue generation, rather than in terms of what is necessary to promote public safety.9 Each month, the municipal court provides FPD supervisors with a list of the number of tickets issued by each officer and each squad. Supervisors have posted the list inside the police station, a tactic officers say is meant to push them to write more citations.
The Captain of FPD’s Patrol Division regularly communicates with his Division commanders regarding the need to increase traffic “productivity,” and productivity is a common topic at squad meetings. Patrol Division supervisors monitor productivity through monthly “self-initiated activity reports” and instruct officers to increase production when those reports show they have not issued enough citations. In April 2010, for example, a patrol supervisor criticized a sergeant for his squad only issuing 25 tickets in a month, including one officer who issued “a grand total” of 11 tickets to six people on three days “devoted to traffic stops.” In November 2011, the same patrol supervisor wrote to his patrol lieutenants and sergeants that “he monthly self-initiated activity totals just came out,” and they “may want to advise  officers who may be interested in the open detective position that one of the categories to be considered when deciding on the eligibility list will be self-initiated activity.” The supervisor continued: “Have any of you heard comments such as, why should I produce when I know I’m not getting a raise? Well, some people are about to find out why.” The email concludes with the instruction to “eep in mind, productivity (self-initiated activity) cannot decline for next year.”
FPD has communicated to officers not only that they must focus on bringing in revenue, but that the department has little concern with how officers do this. FPD’s weak systems of supervision, review, and accountability, discussed below in Part III.A., have sent a potent message to officers that their violations of law and policy will be tolerated, provided that officers FPD’s financial focus has also led FPD to elevate municipal enforcement over state-law enforcement. Even where individuals commit violations of state law, if there is an analogous municipal code provision, the police department will nearly always charge the offense under municipal law. A senior member of FPD’s command told us that all Ferguson police officers understand that, when a fine is the likely punishment, municipal rather than state charges should be pursued so that Ferguson will reap the financial benefit.
12
continue to be “productive” in making arrests and writing citations. Where officers fail to meet productivity goals, supervisors have been instructed to alter officer assignments or impose discipline. In August 2012, the Captain of the Patrol Division instructed other patrol supervisors that, “or those officers who are not keeping up an acceptable level of productivity and they have already been addressed at least once if not multiple times, take it to the next level.” He continued: “As we have discussed already, regardless of the seniority and experience take the officer out of the cover car position and assign them to prisoner pick up and bank runs. . . . Failure to perform can result in disciplinary action not just a bad evaluation.” Performance evaluations also heavily emphasize productivity. A June 2013 evaluation indicates one of the “Performance-Related Areas of Improvements” as “Increase/consistent in productivity, the ability to maintain an average ticket  of 28 per month.”
Not all officers within FPD agree with this approach. Several officers commented on the futility of imposing mounting penalties on people who will never be able to afford them. One member of FPD’s command staff quoted an old adage, asking: “How can you get blood from a turnip?” Another questioned why FPD did not allow residents to use their limited resources to fix equipment violations, such as broken headlights, rather than paying that money to the City, as fixing the equipment violation would more directly benefit public safety.
However, enough officers—at all ranks—have internalized this message that a culture of reflexive enforcement action, unconcerned with whether the police action actually promotes public safety, and unconcerned with the impact the decision has on individual lives or community trust as a whole, has taken hold within FPD. One commander told us, for example, that when he admonished an officer for writing too many tickets, the officer challenged the commander, asking if the commander was telling him not to do his job. When another commander tried to discipline an officer for over-ticketing, he got the same response from the Chief of Police: “No discipline for doing your job.”
The City closely monitors whether FPD’s enforcement efforts are bringing in revenue at the desired rate. Consistently over the last several years, the Police Chief has directly reported to City officials FPD’s successful efforts at raising revenue through policing, and City officials have continued to encourage those efforts and request regular updates. For example, in June 2010, at the request of the City, the Chief prepared a report comparing court revenues in Ferguson to court revenues for cities of similar sizes. The Chief’s email sending the report to the City Manager notes that, “of the 80 St. Louis County Municipal Courts reporting revenue, only 8, including Ferguson, have collections greater than one million dollars.” In the February 2011 report referenced above, Chief Jackson discussed various obstacles to officers writing tickets in previous months, such as training, injury leave, and officer deployment to Iraq, but noted that those factors had subsided and that, as a result, revenues were increasing. The acting prosecutor echoed these statements, stating “we now have several new officers writing tickets, and as a result our overall ticket volume is increasing by 400-700 tickets per month. This increased volume will lead to larger dockets this year and should have a direct effect in increasing overall revenue to the municipal court.”
10 After a recommendation we made during this investigation, Ferguson has recently begun a very limited “correctable violation” or “fix-it” ticket program, under which charges for certain violations can be dismissed if corrected within a certain period of time.
13
Similarly, in March 2011, the Chief reported to the City Manager that court revenue in February was $179,862.50, and that the total “beat our next biggest month in the last four years by over $17,000,” to which the City Manager responded: “Wonderful!” In a June 2011 email from Chief Jackson to the Finance Director and City Manager, the Chief reported that “May is the 6th straight month in which court revenue (gross) has exceeded the previous year.” The City Manager again applauded the Chief’s efforts, and the Finance Director added praise, noting that the Chief is “substantially in control of the outcome.” The Finance Director further recommended in this email greater police and judicial enforcement to “have a profound effect on collections.” Similarly, in a January 2013 email from Chief Jackson to the City Manager, the Chief reported: “Municipal Court gross revenue for calendar year 2012 passed the $2,000,000 mark for the first time in history, reaching $2,066,050 (not including red light photo enforcement).” The City Manager responded: “Awesome! Thanks!” In one March 2012 email, the Captain of the Patrol Division reported directly to the City Manager that court collections in February 2012 reached $235,000, and that this was the first month collections ever exceeded $200,000. The Captain noted that “he  girls have been swamped all day with a line of people paying off fines today. Since 9:30 this morning there hasn’t been less than 5 people waiting in line and for the last three hours 10 to 15 people at all times.” The City Manager enthusiastically reported the Captain’s email to the City Council and congratulated both police department and court staff on their “great work.”
Even as officers have answered the call for greater revenue through code enforcement, the City continues to urge the police department to bring in more money. In a March 2013 email, the Finance Director wrote: “Court fees are anticipated to rise about 7.5%. I did ask the Chief if he thought the PD could deliver 10% increase. He indicated they could try.” Even more recently, the City’s Finance Director stated publicly that Ferguson intends to make up a 2014 revenue shortfall in 2015 through municipal code enforcement, stating to Bloomberg News that “here’s about a million-dollar increase in public-safety fines to make up the difference.”11 The City issued a statement to “refute” the Bloomberg article in part because it “insinuates” an “over reliance on municipal court fines as a primary source of revenues when in fact they represented less than 12% of city revenues for the last fiscal year.” But there is no dispute that the City budget does, in fact, forecast an increase of nearly a million dollars in municipal code enforcement fines and fees in 2015 as reported in the Bloomberg News report.
The City goes so far as to direct FPD to develop enforcement strategies and initiatives, not to better protect the public, but to raise more revenue. In an April 2014 communication from the Finance Director to Chief Jackson and the City Manager, the Finance Director recommended immediate implementation of an “I-270 traffic enforcement initiative” in order to “begin to fill the revenue pipeline.” The Finance Director’s email attached a computation of the net revenues that would be generated by the initiative, which required paying five officers overtime for highway traffic enforcement for a four-hour shift. The Finance Director stated that “there is nothing to keep us from running this initiative 1,2,3,4,5,6, or even 7 days a week. Admittedly at 7 days per week we would see diminishing returns.” Indeed, in a separate email to FPD
11 Katherine Smith, Ferguson to Increase Police Ticketing to Close City’s Budget Gap, Bloomberg News (Dec. 12, 2014), http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-12-12/ferguson-to-increase-police-ticketing-to-close-city-s-budget-gap.
supervisors, the Patrol Captain explained that “he plan behind this  is to PRODUCE traffic tickets, not provide easy OT.” There is no indication that anyone considered whether community policing and public safety would be better served by devoting five overtime officers to neighborhood policing instead of a “revenue pipeline” of highway traffic enforcement. Rather, the only downsides to the program that City officials appear to have considered are that “this initiative requires 60 to 90  of lead time to turn citations into cash,” and that Missouri law caps the proportion of revenue that can come from municipal fines at 30%, which limits the extent to which the program can be used. See Mo. Rev. Stat. § 302.341.2. With regard to the statewide-cap issue, the Finance Director advised: “As the RLCs  net revenues ramp up to whatever we believe its annualized rate will be, then we can figure out how to balance the two programs to get their total revenues as close as possible to the statutory limit of 30%.”12
The City has made clear to the Police Chief and the Municipal Judge that revenue generation must also be a priority in court operations. The Finance Director’s February 2011 report to the City Council notes that “Judge Brockmeyer was first appointed in 2003, and during this time has been successful in significantly increasing court collections over the years.” The report includes a list of “what he has done to help in the areas of court efficiency and revenue.” The list, drafted by Judge Brockmeyer, approvingly highlights the creation of additional fees, many of which are widely considered abusive and may be unlawful, including several that the City has repealed during the pendency of our investigation. These include a $50 fee charged each time a person has a pending municipal arrest warrant cleared, and a “failure to appear fine,” which the Judge noted is “increased each time the Defendant fails to appear in court or pay a fine.” The Judge also noted increasing fines for repeat offenders, “especially in regard to housing violations,  have increased substantially and will continue to be increased upon subsequent violations.” The February 2011 report notes Judge Brockmeyer’s statement that “none of these changes could have taken place without the cooperation of the Court Clerk, the Chief of Police, and the Prosecutor’s Office.” Indeed, the acting prosecutor noted in the report that “I have denied defendants’ needless requests for continuance from the payment docket in an effort to aid in the court’s efficient collection of its fines.”
Court staff are keenly aware that the City considers revenue generation to be the municipal court’s primary purpose. Revenue targets for court fines and fees are created in consultation not only with Chief Jackson, but also the Court Clerk. In one April 2010 exchange with Chief Jackson entitled “2011 Budget,” for example, the Finance Director sought and received confirmation that the Police Chief and the Court Clerk would prepare targets for the court’s fine and fee collections for subsequent years. Court staff take steps to ensure those targets are met in operating court. For example, in April 2011, the Court Clerk wrote to Judge
12 Ferguson officials have asserted that in the last fiscal year revenue from the municipal court comprised only 12% of City revenue, but they have not made clear how they calculated this figure. It appears that 12% is the proportion of Ferguson’s total revenue (forecasted to amount to $18.62 million in 2014) derived from fines and fees (forecasted to be $2.09 million in 2014). Guidelines issued by the Missouri State Auditor in December 2014 provide, however, that the 30% cap outlined in Mo. Rev. Stat. § 302.341.2 imposes a limit on the makeup of fines and fees in general use revenue, excluding any revenue designated for a particular purpose. Notably, the current 30% state cap only applies to fines and fees derived from “traffic violations.” It thus appears that, for purposes of the state cap, Ferguson must ensure that its traffic-related fines and fees do not exceed 30% of its “General Fund” revenue. In 2014, Ferguson’s General Fund revenue was forecasted to be $12.33 million.

Brockmeyer (copying Chief Jackson) that the fines the new Prosecuting Attorney was recommending were not high enough. The Clerk highlighted one case involving three Derelict Vehicle charges and a Failure to Comply charge that resulted in $76 in fines, and noted this “normally would have brought a fine of all three charges around $400.” After describing another case that she believed warranted higher fines, the Clerk concluded: “We need to keep up our revenue.” There is no indication that ability to pay or public safety goals were considered.
The City has been aware for years of concerns about the impact its focus on revenue has had on lawful police action and the fair administration of justice in Ferguson. It has disregarded those concerns—even concerns raised from within the City government—to avoid disturbing the court’s ability to optimize revenue generation. In 2012, a Ferguson City Councilmember wrote to other City officials in opposition to Judge Brockmeyer’s reappointment, stating that “ does not listen to the testimony, does not review the reports or the criminal history of defendants, and doesn’t let all the pertinent witnesses testify before rendering a verdict.” The Councilmember then addressed the concern that “switching judges would/could lead to loss of revenue,” arguing that even if such a switch did “lead to a slight loss, I think it’s more important that cases are being handled properly and fairly.” The City Manager acknowledged mixed reviews of the Judge’s work but urged that the Judge be reappointed, noting that “t goes without saying the City cannot afford to lose any efficiency in our Courts, nor experience any decrease in our Fines and Forfeitures.”
IV. FERGUSON LAW ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES VIOLATE THE LAW AND UNDERMINE COMMUNITY TRUST, ESPECIALLY AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS
Ferguson’s strategy of revenue generation through policing has fostered practices in the two central parts of Ferguson’s law enforcement system—policing and the courts—that are themselves unconstitutional or that contribute to constitutional violations. In both parts of the system, these practices disproportionately harm African Americans. Further, the evidence indicates that this harm to African Americans stems, at least in part, from racial bias, including racial stereotyping. Ultimately, unlawful and harmful practices in policing and in the municipal court system erode police legitimacy and community trust, making policing in Ferguson less fair, less effective at promoting public safety, and less safe.
A. Ferguson’s Police Practices
FPD’s approach to law enforcement, shaped by the City’s pressure to raise revenue, has resulted in a pattern and practice of constitutional violations. Officers violate the Fourth Amendment in stopping people without reasonable suspicion, arresting them without probable cause, and using unreasonable force. Officers frequently infringe on residents’ First Amendment rights, interfering with their right to record police activities and making enforcement decisions based on the content of individuals’ expression.
FPD’s lack of systems to detect and hold officers responsible for misconduct reflects the department’s focus on revenue generation at the expense of lawful policing and helps perpetuate the patterns of unconstitutional conduct we found. FPD fails to adequately supervise officers or review their enforcement actions. While FPD collects vehicle-stop data because it is required to do so by state law, it collects no reliable or consistent data regarding pedestrian stops, even though it has the technology to do so.13 In Ferguson, officers will sometimes make an arrest without writing a report or even obtaining an incident number, and hundreds of reports can pile up for months without supervisors reviewing them. Officers’ uses of force frequently go unreported, and are reviewed only laxly when reviewed at all. As a result of these deficient practices, stops, arrests, and uses of force that violate the law or FPD policy are rarely detected and often ignored when they are discovered.
1. FPD Engages in a Pattern of Unconstitutional Stops and Arrests in Violation of the Fourth Amendment
FPD’s approach to law enforcement has led officers to conduct stops and arrests that violate the Constitution. We identified several elements to this pattern of misconduct. Frequently, officers stop people without reasonable suspicion or arrest them without probable cause. Officers rely heavily on the municipal “Failure to Comply” charge, which appears to be facially unconstitutional in part, and is frequently abused in practice. FPD also relies on a system of officer-generated arrest orders called “wanteds” that circumvents the warrant system and poses a significant risk of abuse. The data show, moreover, that FPD misconduct in the area of stops and arrests disproportionately impacts African Americans.
a. FPD Officers Frequently Detain People Without Reasonable Suspicion and Arrest People Without Probable Cause
The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures. Generally, a search or seizure is unreasonable “in the absence of individualized suspicion of wrongdoing.” City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32, 37 (2000). The Fourth Amendment permits law enforcement officers to briefly detain individuals for investigative purposes if the officers possess reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968). Reasonable suspicion exists when an “officer is aware of particularized, objective facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably warrant suspicion that a crime is being committed.” United States v. Givens, 763 F.3d 987, 989 (8th Cir. 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). In addition, if the officer reasonably believes the person with whom he or she is dealing is armed and dangerous, the officer may conduct a protective search or frisk of the person’s outer clothing. United States v. Cotter, 701 F.3d 544, 547 (8th Cir. 2012). Such a search is not justified on the basis of “inchoate and unparticularized suspicion;” rather, the “issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.” Id. (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 27). For an arrest to constitute a reasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment, it must be supported by probable cause, which exists only if “the totality of facts based on reasonably trustworthy information would justify a prudent person in believing the individual arrested had
13 FPD policy states that “fficers should document” all field contacts and field interrogation “relevant to criminal activity and identification of criminal suspects on the appropriate Department approved computer entry forms.” FPD General Order 407.00. Policy requires that a “Field Investigation Report” be completed for persons and vehicles “in all instances when an officer feels” that the subject “may be in the area for a questionable or suspicious purpose.” FPD General Order 422.01. In practice, however, FPD officers do not reliably document field contacts, particularly of pedestrians, and the department does not evaluate such field contacts.

committed an offense at the time of the arrest.” Stoner v. Watlingten, 735 F.3d 799, 803 (8th Cir. 2013).
Under Missouri law, when making an arrest, “he officer must inform the defendant by what authority he acts, and must also show the warrant if required.” Mo. Rev. Stat. § 544.180.
In reviewing FPD records, we found numerous incidents in which—based on the officer’s own description of the detention—an officer detained an individual without articulable reasonable suspicion of criminal activity or arrested a person without probable cause. In none of these cases did the officer explain or justify his conduct.
For example, in July 2013 police encountered an African-American man in a parking lot while on their way to arrest someone else at an apartment building. Police knew that the encountered man was not the person they had come to arrest. Nonetheless, without even reasonable suspicion, they handcuffed the man, placed him in the back of a patrol car, and ran his record. It turned out he was the intended arrestee’s landlord. The landlord went on to help the police enter the person’s unit to effect the arrest, but he later filed a complaint alleging racial discrimination and unlawful detention. Ignoring the central fact that they had handcuffed a man and put him in a police car despite having no reason to believe he had done anything wrong, a sergeant vigorously defended FPD’s actions, characterizing the detention as “minimal” and pointing out that the car was air conditioned. Even temporary detention, however, constitutes a deprivation of liberty and must be justified under the Fourth Amendment. Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806, 809-10 (1996).
Many of the unlawful stops we found appear to have been driven, in part, by an officer’s desire to check whether the subject had a municipal arrest warrant pending. Several incidents suggest that officers are more concerned with issuing citations and generating charges than with addressing community needs. In October 2012, police officers pulled over an African-American man who had lived in Ferguson for 16 years, claiming that his passenger-side brake light was broken. The driver happened to have replaced the light recently and knew it to be functioning properly. Nonetheless, according to the man’s written complaint, one officer stated, “let’s see how many tickets you’re going to get,” while a second officer tapped his Electronic Control Weapon (“ECW”) on the roof of the man’s car. The officers wrote the man a citation for “tail light/reflector/license plate light out.” They refused to let the man show them that his car’s equipment was in order, warning him, “don’t you get out of that car until you get to your house.” The man, who believed he had been racially profiled, was so upset that he went to the police station that night to show a sergeant that his brakes and license plate light worked.
At times, the constitutional violations are even more blatant. An African-American man recounted to us an experience he had while sitting at a bus stop near Canfield Drive. According to the man, an FPD patrol car abruptly pulled up in front of him. The officer inside, a patrol lieutenant, rolled down his window and addressed the man:
Lieutenant: Get over here.
Bus Patron: Me?
Lieutenant: Get the f*** over here. Yeah, you.
Bus Patron: Why? What did I do?
18
Lieutenant: Give me your ID.
Bus Patron: Why?
Lieutenant: Stop being a smart ass and give me your ID.
The lieutenant ran the man’s name for warrants. Finding none, he returned the ID and said, “get the hell out of my face.” These allegations are consistent with other, independent allegations of misconduct that we heard about this particular lieutenant, and reflect the routinely disrespectful treatment many African Americans say they have come to expect from Ferguson police. That a lieutenant with supervisory responsibilities allegedly engaged in this conduct is further cause for concern.
This incident is also consistent with a pattern of suspicionless, legally unsupportable stops we found documented in FPD’s records, described by FPD as “ped checks” or “pedestrian checks.” Though at times officers use the term to refer to reasonable-suspicion-based pedestrian stops, or “Terry stops,” they often use it when stopping a person with no objective, articulable suspicion. For example, one night in December 2013, officers went out and “ped. checked those wandering around” in Ferguson’s apartment complexes. In another case, officers responded to a call about a man selling drugs by stopping a group of six African-American youths who, due to their numbers, did not match the facts of the call. The youths were “detained and ped checked.” Officers invoke the term “ped check” as though it has some unique constitutional legitimacy. It does not. Officers may not detain a person, even briefly, without articulable reasonable suspicion. Terry, 392 U.S. at 21. To the extent that the words “ped check” suggest otherwise, the terminology alone is dangerous because it threatens to confuse officers’ understanding of the law. Moreover, because FPD does not track or analyze pedestrian Terry stops—whether termed “ped checks” or something else—in any reliable way, they are especially susceptible to discriminatory or otherwise unlawful use.
As with its pattern of unconstitutional stops, FPD routinely makes arrests without probable cause. Frequently, officers arrest people for conduct that plainly does not meet the elements of the cited offense. For example, in November 2013, an officer approached five African-American young people listening to music in a car. Claiming to have smelled marijuana, the officer placed them under arrest for disorderly conduct based on their “gathering in a group for the purposes of committing illegal activity.” The young people were detained and charged—some taken to jail, others delivered to their parents—despite the officer finding no marijuana, even after conducting an inventory search of the car. Similarly, in February 2012, an officer wrote an arrest notification ticket for Peace Disturbance for “loud music” coming from a car. The arrest ticket appears unlawful as the officer did not assert, and there is no other indication, that a third party was disturbed by the music—an element of the offense. See Ferguson Mun. Code § 29-82 (prohibiting certain conduct that “unreasonably and knowingly disturbs or alarms another person or persons”). Nonetheless, a supervisor approved it. These warrantless arrests violated the Fourth Amendment because they were not based on probable cause. See Virginia v. Moore, 553 U.S. 164, 173 (2008).
While the record demonstrates a pattern of stops that are improper from the beginning, it also exposes encounters that start as constitutionally defensible but quickly cross the line. For example, in the summer of 2012, an officer detained a 32-year-old African-American man who was sitting in his car cooling off after playing basketball. The officer arguably had grounds to stop and question the man, since his windows appeared more deeply tinted than permitted under Ferguson’s code. Without cause, the officer went on to accuse the man of being a pedophile, prohibit the man from using his cell phone, order the man out of his car for a pat-down despite having no reason to believe he was armed, and ask to search his car. When the man refused, citing his constitutional rights, the officer reportedly pointed a gun at his head, and arrested him. The officer charged the man with eight different counts, including making a false declaration for initially providing the short form of his first name (e.g., “Mike” instead of “Michael”) and an address that, although legitimate, differed from the one on his license. The officer also charged the man both with having an expired operator’s license, and with having no operator’s license in possession. The man told us he lost his job as a contractor with the federal government as a result of the charges.
b. FPD Officers Routinely Abuse the “Failure to Comply” Charge
One area of FPD activity deserves special attention for its frequency of Fourth Amendment violations: enforcement of Ferguson’s Failure to Comply municipal ordinance.14 Ferguson Mun. Code § 29-16. Officers rely heavily on this charge to arrest individuals who do not do what they ask, even when refusal is not a crime. The offense is typically charged under one of two subsections. One subsection prohibits disobeying a lawful order in a way that hinders an officer’s duties, § 29-16(1); the other requires individuals to identify themselves, § 29-16(2). FPD engages in a pattern of unconstitutional enforcement with respect to both, resulting in many unlawful arrests.
i. Improper Enforcement of Code Provision Prohibiting Disobeying a Lawful Order
Officers frequently arrest individuals under Section 29-16(1) on facts that do not meet the provision’s elements. Section 29-16(1) makes it unlawful to “ail to comply with the lawful order or request of a police officer in the discharge of the officer’s official duties where such failure interfered with, obstructed or hindered the officer in the performance of such duties.” Many cases initiated under this provision begin with an officer ordering an individual to stop despite lacking objective indicia that the individual is engaged in wrongdoing. The order to stop is not a “lawful order” under those circumstances because the officer lacks reasonable suspicion that criminal activity is afoot. See United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 882-83 (1975); United States v. Jones, 606 F.3d 964, 967-68 (8th Cir. 2010). Nonetheless, when individuals do not stop in those situations, FPD officers treat that conduct as a failure to comply with a lawful order, and make arrests. Such arrests violate the Fourth Amendment because they are not based on probable cause that the crime of Failure to Comply has been committed. Dunaway v. New York, 442 U.S. 200, 208 (1979).
FPD officers apply Section 29-16(1) remarkably broadly. In an incident from August 2010, an officer broke up an altercation between two minors and sent them back to their homes. The officer ordered one to stay inside her residence and the other not to return to the first’s
14 FPD officers are not consistent in how they label this charge in their reports. They refer to violations of Section 29-16 as both “Failure to Comply” and “Failure to Obey.” This report refers to all violations of this code provision as “Failure to Comply.”
20
residence. Later that day, the two minors again engaged in an altercation outside the first minor’s residence. The officer arrested both for Failure to Comply with the earlier orders. But Section 29-16(1) does not confer on officers the power to confine people to their homes or keep them away from certain places based solely on their verbal orders. At any rate, the facts of this incident do not satisfy the statute for another reason: there was no evidence that the failure to comply “interfered with, obstructed or hindered the officer in the performance” of official duties. § 29-16(1). The officer’s arrest of the two minors for Failure to Comply without probable cause of all elements of the offense violated the Fourth Amendment.
ii. Improper Enforcement of Code Provision Requiring Individuals to Identify Themselves to a Police Officer
FPD’s charging under Section 29-16(2) also violates the Constitution. Section 29-16(2) makes it unlawful to “ail to give information requested by a police officer in the discharge of his/her official duties relating to the identity of such person.” This provision, a type of “stop-and-identify” law, is likely unconstitutional under the void-for-vagueness doctrine. It is also unconstitutional as typically applied by FPD.
As the Supreme Court has explained, the void-for-vagueness doctrine “requires that a penal statute define the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness that ordinary people can understand what conduct is prohibited and in a manner that does not encourage arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.” Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 357 (1983). In Kolender, the Supreme Court invalidated a California stop-and-identify law as unconstitutionally vague because its requirement that detained persons give officers “credible and reliable” identification provided no standard for what a suspect must do to comply with it. Instead, the law “vest complete discretion in the hands of the police” to determine whether a person had provided sufficient identity information, which created a “potential for arbitrarily suppressing First Amendment liberties” and “the constitutional right to freedom of movement.” Id. at 358. The Eighth Circuit has applied the doctrine numerous times. In Fields v. City of Omaha, 810 F.2d 830 (8th Cir. 1987), the court struck down a city ordinance that required a person to “identify himself” because it did not make definite what would suffice for identification and thereby provided no “standard to guide the police officer’s discretionary assessment” or “prevent arbitrary and discriminatory law enforcement.” Id. at 833-34; see also Stahl v. City of St. Louis, 687 F.3d 1038, 1040 (8th Cir. 2012) (holding that an ordinance prohibiting conduct that would impede traffic was unconstitutionally vague under the Due Process Clause because it “may fail to provide the kind of notice that will enable ordinary people to understand what conduct it prohibits”) (internal quotation marks omitted).
Under these binding precedents, Ferguson’s stop-and-identify law appears to be unconstitutionally vague because the term “information . . . relating to the identity of such person” in Section 29-16(2) is not defined. Neither the ordinance nor any court has narrowed that language. Cf. Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Ct. of Nevada, 542 U.S. 177, 188-89 (2004) (upholding stop-and-identify law that was construed by the state supreme court to require only that a suspect provide his name). As a consequence, the average person has no understanding of precisely how much identity information, and what kind, he or she must provide when an FPD officer demands it; nor do officers. Indeed, we are aware of several people who were asked to provide their Social Security numbers, including one man who was arrested after refusing to do so. Given that the ordinance appears to lend itself to such arbitrary enforcement, Section 29-16(2) is likely unconstitutional on its face.15
Even apart from the facial unconstitutionality of the statute, the evidence is clear that FPD’s enforcement of Section 29-16(2) is unconstitutional in its application. Stop-and-identify laws stand in tension with the Supreme Court’s admonition that a person approached by a police officer “need not answer any question put to him; indeed, he may decline to listen to the questions at all and may go on his way.” Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 497-98 (1983). For this reason, the Court has held that an officer cannot require a person to identify herself unless the officer first has reasonable suspicion to initiate the stop. See Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47, 52-53 (1979) (holding that the application of a Texas statute that criminalized refusal to provide a name and address to a peace officer violated the Fourth Amendment where the officer lacked reasonable suspicion of criminal activity); see also Hiibel, 542 U.S. at 184 (deeming the reasonable suspicion requirement a “constitutional limitation” on stop-and-identify statutes). FPD officers, however, routinely arrest individuals under Section 29-16(2) for failure to identify themselves despite lacking reasonable suspicion to stop them in the first place.
For example, in an October 2011 incident, an officer arrested two sisters who were backing their car into their driveway. The officer claimed that the car had been idling in the middle of the street, warranting investigation, while the women claim they had pulled up outside their home to drop someone off when the officer arrived. In any case, the officer arrested one sister for failing to provide her identification when requested. He arrested the other sister for getting out of the car after being ordered to stay inside. The two sisters spent the next three hours in jail. In a similar incident from December 2011, police officers approached two people sitting in a car on a public street and asked the driver for identification. When the driver balked, insisting that he was on a public street and should not have to answer questions, the officers ordered him out of the car and ultimately charged him with Failure to Comply.
In another case, from March 2013, officers responded to the police station to take custody of a person wanted on a state warrant. When they arrived, they encountered a different man—not the subject of the warrant—who happened to be leaving the station. Having nothing to connect the man to the warrant subject, other than his presence at the station, the officers nonetheless stopped him and asked that he identify himself. The man asserted his rights, asking the officers “Why do you need to know?” and declining to be frisked. When the man then extended his identification toward the officers, at their request, the officers interpreted his hand motion as an attempted assault and took him to the ground. Without articulating reasonable suspicion or any other justification for the initial detention, the officers arrested the man on two counts of Failure to Comply and two counts of Resisting Arrest.
In our conversations with FPD officers, one officer admitted that when he conducts a traffic stop, he asks for identification from all passengers as a matter of course. If any refuses, he considers that to be “furtive and aggressive” conduct and cites—and typically arrests—the
15 Other broad quality-of-life ordinances in the Ferguson municipal code, such as the disorderly conduct provision, may also be vulnerable to attack as unconstitutionally vague or overbroad. See Ferguson Mun. Code § 29-94 (defining disorderly conduct to include the conduct of “ny person, while in a public place, who utters in a loud, abusive or threatening manner, any obscene words, epithets or similar abusive language”) (emphasis added).
22
person for Failure to Comply. The officer thus acknowledged that he regularly exceeds his authority under the Fourth Amendment by arresting passengers who refuse, as is their right, to provide identification. See Hiibel, 542 U.S. at 188 (“n officer may not arrest a suspect for failure to identify himself if the request for identification is not reasonably related to the circumstances justifying the stop.”); Stufflebeam v. Harris, 521 F.3d 884, 887-88 (8th Cir. 2008) (holding that the arrest of a passenger for failure to identify himself during a traffic stop violated the Fourth Amendment where the passenger was not suspected of other criminal activity and his identification was not needed for officer safety). Further, the officer told us that he was trained to arrest for this violation.
Good supervision would correct improper arrests by an officer before they became routine. But in Ferguson, the same dynamics that lead officers to make unlawful stops and arrests cause supervisors to conduct only perfunctory review of officers’ actions—when they conduct any review at all. FPD supervisors are more concerned with the number of citations and arrests officers produce than whether those citations and arrests are lawful or promote public safety. Internal communications among command staff reveal that FPD for years has failed to ensure even that officers write their reports and first-line supervisors approve them. In 2010, a senior police official complained to supervisors that every week reports go unwritten, and hundreds of reports remain unapproved. “It is time for you to hold your officers accountable,” he urged them. In 2014, the official had the same complaint, remarking on 600 reports that had not been approved over a six-month period. Another supervisor remarked that coding errors in the new records management system is set up “to hide, do away with, or just forget reports,” creating a heavy administrative burden for supervisors who discover incomplete reports months after they are created. In practice, not all arrests are given incident numbers, meaning supervisors may never know to review them. These systemic deficiencies in oversight are consistent with an approach to law enforcement in which productivity and revenue generation, rather than lawful policing, are the priority. Thus, even as commanders exhort line supervisors to more closely supervise officer activity, they perpetuate the dynamics that discourage meaningful supervision.
c. FPD’s Use of a Police-run “Wanted” System Circumvents Judicial Review and Poses the Risk of Abuse
FPD and other law enforcement agencies in St. Louis County use a system of “wanteds” or “stop orders” as a substitute for seeking judicial approval for an arrest warrant. When officers believe a person has committed a crime but are not able to immediately locate that person, they can enter a “wanted” into the statewide law enforcement database, indicating to all other law enforcement agencies that the person should be arrested if located. While wanteds are supposed to be based on probable cause, see FPD General Order 424.01, they operate as an end-run around the judicial system. Instead of swearing out a warrant and seeking judicial authorization from a neutral and detached magistrate, officers make the probable cause determination themselves and circumvent the courts. Officers use wanteds for serious state-level crimes and minor code violations alike, including traffic offenses.
FPD command staff express support for the wanted system, extolling the benefits of being able to immediately designate a person for detention. But this expedience carries constitutional risks. If officers enter wanteds into the system on less than probable cause, then
23
the subsequent arrest would violate the Fourth Amendment. Our interviews with command staff and officers indicate that officers do not clearly understand the legal authority necessary to issue a wanted. For example, one veteran officer told us he will put out a wanted “if I do not have enough probable cause to arrest you.” He gave the example of investigating a car theft. Upon identifying a suspect, he would put that suspect into the system as wanted “because we do not have probable cause that he stole the vehicle.” Reflecting the muddled analysis officers may employ when deciding whether to issue a wanted, this officer concluded, “you have to have reasonable suspicion and some probable cause to put out a wanted.”
At times, FPD officers use wanteds not merely in spite of a lack of probable cause, but because they lack probable cause. In December 2014, a Ferguson detective investigating a shooting emailed a county prosecutor to see if a warrant for a suspect could be obtained, since “a lot of state agencies won’t act on a wanted.” The prosecutor responded stating that although “hances are” the crime was committed by the suspect, “we just don’t have enough for a warrant right now.” The detective responded that he would enter a wanted.
There is evidence that the use of wanteds has resulted in numerous unconstitutional arrests in Ferguson. Internal communications reveal problems with FPD officers arresting individuals on wanteds without first confirming that the wanteds are still valid. In 2010, for instance, an FPD supervisor wrote that “s of late we have had subjects arrested that were wanted for other agencies brought in without being verified first. You guessed it, come to find out they were no longer wanted by the agencies and had to be released.” The same supervisor told us that in 2014 he cleared hundreds of invalid wanteds from the system, some of them over ten years old, suggesting that invalid wanteds have been an ongoing problem.
Wanteds can also be imprecise, leading officers to arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment. For example, in June 2011, officers arrested a man at gunpoint because the car he was driving had an active wanted “on the vehicle and its occupants” in connection with an alleged theft. In fact, the theft was alleged to have been committed by the man’s brother. Nonetheless, according to FPD’s files, the man was arrested solely on the basis of the wanted.
This system creates the risk that wanteds could be used improperly to develop evidence necessary for arrest rather than to secure a person against whom probable cause already exists. Several officers described wanteds as an investigatory tool. According to Chief Jackson, “a wanted allows us to get a suspect in for booking and potential interrogation.” One purpose, he said, is “to conduct an interview of that person.” While it is perfectly legitimate for officers to try to obtain statements from persons lawfully detained, it is unconstitutional for them to jail individuals on less than probable cause for that purpose. Dunaway, 442 U.S. at 216. One senior supervisor acknowledged that wanteds could be abused. He agreed that the potential exists, for example, for an officer to pressure a subject into speaking voluntarily to avoid being arrested. These are risks that the judicially-reviewed warrant process is meant to avoid.
Compounding our concern is the minimal training and supervision provided on when to issue a wanted, and the lack of any meaningful oversight to detect and respond to improperly issued wanteds. Some officers told us that they may have heard about wanteds in the training academy. Others said that they received no formal training on wanteds and learned about them
24
from their field training officers. As for supervision, officers are supposed to get authorization from their supervisors before entering a wanted into a law enforcement database. They purportedly do this by providing the factual basis for probable cause to their supervisors, orally or in their written reports. However, several supervisors and officers we spoke with acknowledged that this supervisory review routinely does not happen. Further, the supervisors we interviewed told us that they had never declined to authorize a wanted.
Finally, a Missouri appellate court has highlighted the constitutional risks of relying on a wanted as the basis for an arrest. In State v. Carroll, 745 S.W.2d 156 (Mo. Ct. App. 1987), the court held that a robbery suspect was arrested without probable cause when Ferguson and St. Louis police officers picked him up on a wanted for leaving the scene of an accident. Id. at 158. The officers then interrogated him three times at two different police stations, and he eventually made incriminating statements. Despite the existence of a wanted, the court deemed the initial arrest unconstitutional because “he record . . . fail to show any facts known to the police at the time of the arrest to support a reasonable belief that defendant had committed a crime.” Id. Carroll highlights the fact that wanteds do not confer an authority equal to a judicial arrest warrant. Rather, the Carroll court’s holding suggests that wanteds may be of unknown reliability and thus insufficient to permit custodial detention under the Fourth Amendment. See also Steven J. Mulroy, “Hold” On: The Remarkably Resilient, Constitutionally Dubious 48-Hour Hold, 63 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 815, 823, 842-45 (2013) (observing that one problem with police “holds” is that, although they require probable cause, “in practice they often lack it”).
We received complaints from FPD officers that the County prosecutor’s office is too restrictive in granting warrant requests, and that this has necessitated the wanted practice. This investigation did not determine whether the St. Louis County prosecutor is overly restrictive or appropriately cautious in granting warrant requests. What is clear, however, is that current FPD practices have resulted in wanteds being issued and executed without legal basis.
2. FPD Engages in a Pattern of First Amendment Violations
FPD’s approach to enforcement results in violations of individuals’ First Amendment rights. FPD arrests people for a variety of protected conduct: people are punished for talking back to officers, recording public police activities, and lawfully protesting perceived injustices.
Under the Constitution, what a person says generally should not determine whether he or she is jailed. Police officers cannot constitutionally make arrest decisions based on individuals’ verbal expressions of disrespect for law enforcement, including use of foul language. Buffkins v. City of Omaha, 922 F.2d 465, 472 (8th Cir. 1990) (holding that officers violated the Constitution when they arrested a woman for disorderly conduct after she called one an “asshole,” especially since “police officers are expected to exercise greater restraint in their response than the average citizen”); Copeland v. Locke, 613 F.3d 875, 880 (8th Cir. 2010) (holding that the First Amendment prohibited a police chief from arresting an individual who pointed at him and told him “move the f*****g car,” even if the comment momentarily distracted the chief from a routine traffic stop); Gorra v. Hanson, 880 F.2d 95, 100 (8th Cir. 1989) (holding that arresting a person in retaliation for making a statement “constitutes obvious infringement” of the First Amendment). As the Supreme Court has held, “the First Amendment protects a significant
25
amount of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers.” City of Houston, Tex. v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 461 (1987) (striking down as unconstitutionally overbroad a local ordinance that criminalized interference with police by speech).
In Ferguson, however, officers frequently make enforcement decisions based on what subjects say, or how they say it. Just as officers reflexively resort to arrest immediately upon noncompliance with their orders, whether lawful or not, they are quick to overreact to challenges and verbal slights. These incidents—sometimes called “contempt of cop” cases—are propelled by officers’ belief that arrest is an appropriate response to disrespect. These arrests are typically charged as a Failure to Comply, Disorderly Conduct, Interference with Officer, or Resisting Arrest.
For example, in July 2012, a police officer arrested a business owner on charges of Interfering in Police Business and Misuse of 911 because she objected to the officer’s detention of her employee. The officer had stopped the employee for “walking unsafely in the street” as he returned to work from the bank. According to FPD records, the owner “became verbally involved,” came out of her shop three times after being asked to stay inside, and called 911 to complain to the Police Chief. The officer characterized her protestations as interference and arrested her inside her shop.16 The arrest violated the First Amendment, which “does not allow such speech to be made a crime.” Hill, 482 U.S. at 462. Indeed, the officer’s decision to arrest the woman after she tried to contact the Police Chief suggests that he may have been retaliating against her for reporting his conduct.
Officers in Ferguson also use their arrest power to retaliate against individuals for using language that, while disrespectful, is protected by the Constitution. For example, one afternoon in September 2012, an officer stopped a 20-year-old African-American man for dancing in the middle of a residential street. The officer obtained the man’s identification and ran his name for warrants. Finding none, he told the man he was free to go. The man responded with profanities. When the officer told him to watch his language and reminded him that he was not being arrested, the man continued using profanity and was arrested for Manner of Walking in Roadway.
In February 2014, officers responded to a group of African-American teenage girls “play fighting” (in the words of the officer) in an intersection after school. When one of the schoolgirls gave the middle finger to a white witness who had called the police, an officer ordered her over to him. One of the girl’s friends accompanied her. Though the friend had the right to be present and observe the situation—indeed, the offense reports include no facts suggesting a safety concern posed by her presence—the officers ordered her to leave and then attempted to arrest her when she refused. Officers used force to arrest the friend as she pulled away. When the first girl grabbed an officer’s shoulder, they used force to arrest her, as well.
16 The ordinance on interfering with arrest, detention, or stop, Ferguson Mun. Code § 29-17, does not actually permit arrest unless the subject uses or threatens violence, which did not occur here. Another code provision the officer may have relied on, § 29-19, is likely unconstitutionally overbroad because it prohibits obstruction of government operations “in any manner whatsoever.” See Hill, 482 U.S. at 455, 462, 466 (invalidating ordinance that made it unlawful to “in any manner oppose, molest, abuse, or interrupt any policeman in the execution of his duty”).
26
Officers charged the two teenagers with a variety of offenses, including: Disorderly Conduct for giving the middle finger and using obscenities; Manner of Walking for being in the street; Failure to Comply for staying to observe; Interference with Officer; Assault on a Law Enforcement Officer; and Endangering the Welfare of a Child (themselves and their schoolmates) by resisting arrest and being involved in disorderly conduct. This incident underscores how officers’ unlawful response to activity protected by the First Amendment can quickly escalate to physical resistance, resulting in additional force, additional charges, and increasing the risk of injury to officers and members of the public alike.
These accounts are drawn entirely from officers’ own descriptions, recorded in offense reports. That FPD officers believe criticism and insolence are grounds for arrest, and that supervisors have condoned such unconstitutional policing, reflects intolerance for even lawful opposition to the exercise of police authority. These arrests also reflect that, in FPD, many officers have no tools for de-escalating emotionally charged scenes, even though the ability of a police officer to bring calm to a situation is a core policing skill.
FPD officers also routinely infringe on the public’s First Amendment rights by preventing people from recording their activities. The First Amendment “prohibit the government from limiting the stock of information from which members of the public may draw.” First Nat’l Bank v. Belloti, 435 U.S. 765, 783 (1978). Applying this principle, the federal courts of appeal have held that the First Amendment “unambiguously” establishes a constitutional right to videotape police activities. Glik v. Cunniffe, 655 F.3d 78, 82 (1st Cir. 2011); see also ACLU v. Alvarez, 679 F.3d 583, 600 (7th Cir. 2012) (issuing a preliminary injunction against the use of a state eavesdropping statute to prevent the recording of public police activities); Fordyce v. City of Seattle, 55 F.3d 436, 439 (9th Cir. 1995) (recognizing a First Amendment right to film police carrying out their public duties); Smith v. City of Cumming, 212 F.3d 1332, 1333 (11th Cir. 2000) (recognizing a First Amendment right “to photograph or videotape police conduct”). Indeed, as the ability to record police activity has become more widespread, the role it can play in capturing questionable police activity, and ensuring that the activity is investigated and subject to broad public debate, has become clear. Protecting civilian recording of police activity is thus at the core of speech the First Amendment is intended to protect. Cf. Branzburg v. Hayes, 408 U.S. 665, 681 (1972) (First Amendment protects “news gathering”); Mills v. Alabama, 384 U.S. 214, 218 (1966) (news gathering enhances “free discussion of governmental affairs”). “In a democracy, public officials have no general privilege to avoid publicity and embarrassment by preventing public scrutiny of their actions.” Walker v. City of Pine Bluff, 414 F.3d 989, 992 (8th Cir. 2005).
In Ferguson, however, officers claim without any factual support that the use of camera phones endangers officer safety. Sometimes, officers offer no rationale at all. Our conversations with community members and review of FPD records found numerous violations of the right to record police activity. In May 2014, an officer pulled over an African-American woman who was driving with her two sons. During the traffic stop, the woman’s 16-year-old son began recording with his cell phone. The officer ordered him to put down the phone and refrain from using it for the remainder of the stop. The officer claimed this was “for safety reasons.” The situation escalated, apparently due to the officer’s rudeness and the woman’s response. According to the 16 year old, he began recording again, leading the officer to wrestle the phone
27
from him. Additional officers arrived and used force to arrest all three civilians under disputed circumstances that could have been clarified by a video recording.
In June 2014, an African-American couple who had taken their children to play at the park allowed their small children to urinate in the bushes next to their parked car. An officer stopped them, threatened to cite them for allowing the children to “expose themselves,” and checked the father for warrants. When the mother asked if the officer had to detain the father in front of the children, the officer turned to the father and said, “you’re going to jail because your wife keeps running her mouth.” The mother then began recording the officer on her cell phone. The officer became irate, declaring, “you don’t videotape me!” As the officer drove away with the father in custody for “parental neglect,” the mother drove after them, continuing to record. The officer then pulled over and arrested her for traffic violations. When the father asked the officer to show mercy, he responded, “no more mercy, since she wanted to videotape,” and declared “nobody videotapes me.” The officer then took the phone, which the couple’s daughter was holding. After posting bond, the couple found that the video had been deleted.
A month later, the same officer pulled over a truck hauling a trailer that did not have operating tail lights. The officer asked for identification from all three people inside, including a 54-year-old white man in the passenger seat who asked why. “You have to have a reason. This is a violation of my Fourth Amendment rights,” he asserted. The officer, who characterized the man’s reaction as “suspicious,” responded, “the reason is, if you don’t hand it to me, I’ll arrest you.” The man provided his identification. The officer then asked the man to move his cell phone from his lap to the dashboard, “for my safety.” The man said, “okay, but I’m going to record this.” Due to nervousness, he could not open the recording application and quickly placed the phone on the dash. The officer then announced that the man was under arrest for Failure to Comply. At the end of the traffic stop, the officer gave the driver a traffic citation, indicated at the other man, and said, “you’re getting this ticket because of him.” Upon bringing that man to the jail, someone asked the officer what offense the man had committed. The officer responded, “he’s one of those guys who watches CNBC too much about his rights.” The man did not say anything else, fearing what else the officer might be capable of doing. He later told us, “I never dreamed I could end up in jail for this. I’m scared of driving through Ferguson now.”
The Ferguson Police Department’s infringement of individuals’ freedom of speech and right to record has been highlighted in recent months in the context of large-scale public protest. In November 2014, a federal judge entered a consent order prohibiting Ferguson officers from interfering with individuals’ rights to lawfully and peacefully record public police activities. That same month, the City settled another suit alleging that it had abused its loitering ordinance, Mun. Code § 29-89, to arrest people who were protesting peacefully on public sidewalks.
Despite these lawsuits, it appears that FPD continues to interfere with individuals’ rights to protest and record police activities. On February 9, 2015, several individuals were protesting outside the Ferguson police station on the six-month anniversary of Michael Brown’s death. According to protesters, and consistent with several video recordings from that evening, the protesters stood peacefully in the police department’s parking lot, on the sidewalks in front of it, and across the street. Video footage shows that two FPD vehicles abruptly accelerated from the police parking lot into the street. An officer announced, “everybody here’s going to jail,”
28
causing the protesters to run. Video shows that as one man recorded the police arresting others, he was arrested for interfering with police action. Officers pushed him to the ground, began handcuffing him, and announced, “stop resisting or you’re going to get tased.” It appears from the video, however, that the man was neither interfering nor resisting. A protester in a wheelchair who was live streaming the protest was also arrested. Another officer moved several people with cameras away from the scene of the arrests, warning them against interfering and urging them to back up or else be arrested for Failure to Obey. The sergeant shouted at those filming that they would be arrested for Manner of Walking if they did not back away out of the street, even though it appears from the video recordings that the protesters and those recording were on the sidewalk at most, if not all, times. Six people were arrested during this incident. It appears that officers’ escalation of this incident was unnecessary and in response to derogatory comments written in chalk on the FPD parking lot asphalt and on a police vehicle.
FPD’s suppression of speech reflects a police culture that relies on the exercise of police power—however unlawful—to stifle unwelcome criticism. Recording police activity and engaging in public protest are fundamentally democratic enterprises because they provide a check on those “who are granted substantial discretion that may be misused to deprive individuals of their liberties.” Glik, 655 F.3d at 82. Even profane backtalk can be a form of dissent against perceived misconduct. In the words of the Supreme Court, “he freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.” Hill, 482 U.S. at 463. Ideally, officers would not encounter verbal abuse. Communities would encourage mutual respect, and the police would likewise exhibit respect by treating people with dignity. But, particularly where officers engage in unconstitutional policing, they only exacerbate community opposition by quelling speech.
3. FPD Engages in a Pattern of Excessive Force in Violation of the Fourth Amendment
FPD engages in a pattern of excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Many officers are quick to escalate encounters with subjects they perceive to be disobeying their orders or resisting arrest. They have come to rely on ECWs, specifically Tasers®, where less force—or no force at all—would do. They also release canines on unarmed subjects unreasonably and before attempting to use force less likely to cause injury. Some incidents of excessive force result from stops or arrests that have no basis in law. Others are punitive and retaliatory. In addition, FPD records suggest a tendency to use unnecessary force against vulnerable groups such as people with mental health conditions or cognitive disabilities, and juvenile students. Furthermore, as discussed in greater detail in Part III.C. of this report, Ferguson’s pattern of using excessive force disproportionately harms African-American members of the community. The overwhelming majority of force—almost 90%—is used against African Americans.
The use of excessive force by a law enforcement officer violates the Fourth Amendment. Graham v. Conner, 490 U.S. 386, 394 (1989); Atkinson v. City of Mountain View, Mo., 709 F.3d 1201, 1207-09 (8th Cir. 2013). The constitutionality of an officer’s use of force depends on whether the officer’s conduct was “‘objectively reasonable’ in light of the facts and
29
circumstances,” which must be assessed “from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.” Graham, 490 U.S. at 396. Relevant considerations include “the severity of the crime at issue, whether the suspect poses an immediate threat to the safety of the officers or others, and whether he is actively resisting arrest or attempting to evade arrest by flight.” Id.; Johnson v. Caroll, 658 F.3d 819, 826 (8th Cir. 2011).
FPD also imposes limits on officers’ use of force through department policies. The use-of-force policy instituted by Chief Jackson in 2010 states that “force may not be resorted to unless other reasonable alternatives have been exhausted or would clearly be ineffective under a particular set of circumstances.” FPD General Order 410.01. The policy also sets out a use-of-force continuum, indicating the force options permitted in different circumstances, depending on the level of resistance provided by a suspect. FPD General Order 410.08.
FPD’s stated practice is to maintain use-of-force investigation files for all situations in which officers use force. We reviewed the entire set of force files provided by the department for the period of January 1, 2010 to September 8, 2014.17 Setting aside the killing of animals (e.g., dogs, injured deer) and three instances in which the subject of the use of force was not identified, FPD provided 151 files. We also reviewed related documentation regarding canine deployments. Our finding that FPD force is routinely unreasonable and sometimes clearly punitive is drawn largely from FPD’s documentation; that is, from officers’ own words.
a. FPD’s Use of Electronic Control Weapons Is Unreasonable
FPD’s pattern of excessive force includes using ECWs in a manner that is unconstitutional, abusive, and unsafe. For example, in August 2010, a lieutenant used an ECW in drive-stun mode against an African-American woman in the Ferguson City Jail because she had refused to remove her bracelets.18 The lieutenant resorted to his ECW even though there were five officers present and the woman posed no physical threat.
Similarly, in November 2013, a correctional officer fired an ECW at an African-American woman’s chest because she would not follow his verbal commands to walk toward a cell. The woman, who had been arrested for driving while intoxicated, had yelled an insulting remark at the officer, but her conduct amounted to verbal noncompliance or passive resistance at most. Instead of attempting hand controls or seeking assistance from a state trooper who was also present, the correctional officer deployed the ECW because the woman was “not doing as she was told.” When another FPD officer wrote up the formal incident report, the reporting officer wrote that the woman “approached  in a threatening manner.” This “threatening manner” allegation appears nowhere in the statements of the correctional
17 This set, however, did not include any substantive information on the August 9, 2014 shooting of Michael Brown by Officer Darren Wilson. That incident is being separately investigated by the Criminal Section of the Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of Missouri.
18 ECWs have two modes. In dart mode, an officer fires a cartridge that sends two darts or prongs into a person’s body, penetrating the skin and delivering a jolt of electricity of a length determined by the officer. In drive-stun mode, sometimes referred to as “pain compliance” mode, an officer presses the weapon directly against a person’s body, pulling the trigger to activate the electricity. Many agencies strictly limit the use of ECWs in drive-stun mode because of the potential for abuse.
30
officer or witness trooper. The woman was charged with Disorderly Conduct, and the correctional officer soon went on to become an officer with another law enforcement agency.
These are not isolated incidents. In September 2012, an officer drive-stunned an African-American woman who he had placed in the back of his patrol car but who had stretched out her leg to block him from closing the door. The woman was in handcuffs. In May 2013, officers drive-stunned a handcuffed African-American man who verbally refused to get out of the back seat of a police car once it had arrived at the jail. The man did not physically resist arrest or attempt to assault the officers. According to the man, he was also punched in the face and head. That allegation was neither reported by the involved officers nor investigated by their supervisor, who dismissed it.
FPD officers seem to regard ECWs as an all-purpose tool bearing no risk. But an ECW—an electroshock weapon that disrupts a person’s muscle control, causing involuntary contractions—can indeed be harmful. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals has observed that ECW-inflicted injuries are “sometimes severe and unexpected.” LaCross v. City of Duluth, 713 F.3d 1155, 1158 (8th Cir. 2013). Electroshock “inflicts a painful and frightening blow, which temporarily paralyzes the large muscles of the body, rendering the victim helpless.” Hickey v. Reeder, 12 F.3d 754, 757 (8th Cir. 1993). Guidance produced by the United States Department of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, and the Police Executive Research Forum in 2011 warns that ECWs are “‘less-lethal’ and not ‘nonlethal weapons’” and “have the potential to result in a fatal outcome.” 2011 Electronic Control Weapon Guidelines 12 (Police Executive Research Forum & U.S. Dep’t of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, Mar. 2011) (“2011 ECW Guidelines”).
FPD officers’ swift, at times automatic, resort to using ECWs against individuals who typically have committed low-level crimes and who pose no immediate threat violates the Constitution. As the Eighth Circuit held in 2011, an officer uses excessive force and violates clearly established Fourth Amendment law when he deploys an ECW against an individual whose crime was minor and who is not actively resisting, attempting to flee, or posing any imminent danger to others. Brown v. City of Golden Valley, 574 F.3d 491, 497-99 (8th Cir. 2011) (upholding the denial of a qualified immunity claim made by an officer who drive-stunned a woman on her arm for two or three seconds when she refused to hang up her phone despite being ordered to do so twice); cf. Hickey, 12 F.3d at 759 (finding that the use of a stun gun against a prisoner for refusing to sweep his cell violated the more deferential Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment). Courts have found that even when a suspect resists but does so only minimally, the surrounding factors may render the use of an ECW objectively unreasonable. See Mattos v. Agarano, 661 F.3d 433, 444-46, 448-51 (9th Cir. 2011) (en banc) (holding in two consolidated cases that minimal defensive resistance—including stiffening the body to inhibit being pulled from a car, and raising an arm in defense—does not render using an ECW reasonable where the offense was minor, the subject did not attempt to flee, and the subject posed no immediate threat to officers); Parker v. Gerrish, 547 F.3d 1, 9-11 (1st Cir. 2008) (upholding a jury verdict of excessive use of force for an ECW use because the evidence supported a finding that the subject who had held his hands together was not actively resisting or posing an immediate threat); Casey v. City of Fed. Heights, 509 F.3d 1278, 1282-83 (10th Cir. 2007) (holding that the use of an ECW was not objectively reasonable when the
31
subject pulled away from the officer but did not otherwise actively resist arrest, attempt to flee, or pose an immediate threat).
Indeed, officers’ unreasonable ECW use violates FPD’s own policies. The department prohibits the use of force unless reasonable alternatives have been exhausted or would clearly be ineffective. FPD General Order 410.01. A separate ECW policy describes the weapon as “designed to overcome active aggression or overt actions of assault.” FPD General Order 499.00. The policy states that an ECW “will never be deployed punitively or for purposes of coercion. It is to be used as a way of averting a potentially injurious or dangerous situation.” FPD General Order 499.04. Despite the existence of clearly established Fourth Amendment case law and explicit departmental policies in this area, FPD officers routinely engage in the unreasonable use of ECWs, and supervisors routinely approve their conduct.
It is in part FPD officers’ approach to policing that leads them to violate the Constitution and FPD’s own policies. Officers across the country encounter drunkenness, passive defiance, and verbal challenges. But in Ferguson, officers have not been trained or incentivized to use de-escalation techniques to avoid or minimize force in these situations. Instead, they respond with impatience, frustration, and disproportionate force. FPD’s weak oversight of officer use of force, described in greater detail below, facilitates this abuse. Officers should be required to view the ECW as one tool among many, and “a weapon of need, not a tool of convenience.” 2011 ECW Guidelines at 11. Effective policing requires that officers not depend on ECWs, or any type of force, “at the expense of diminishing the fundamental skills of communicating with subjects and de-escalating tense encounters.” Id. at 12.
b. FPD’s Use of Canines on Low-level, Unarmed Offenders Is Unreasonable
FPD engages in a pattern of deploying canines to bite individuals when the articulated facts do not justify this significant use of force. The department’s own records demonstrate that, as with other types of force, canine officers use dogs out of proportion to the threat posed by the people they encounter, leaving serious puncture wounds to nonviolent offenders, some of them children. Furthermore, in every canine bite incident for which racial information is available, the subject was African American. This disparity, in combination with the decision to deploy canines in circumstances with a seemingly low objective threat, suggests that race may play an impermissible role in officers’ decisions to deploy canines.
FPD currently has four canines, each assigned to a particular canine officer. Under FPD policy, canines are to be used to locate and apprehend “dangerous offenders.” FPD General Order 498.00. When offenders are hiding, the policy states, “handlers will not allow their K-9 to engage a suspect by biting if a lower level of force could reasonably be expected to control the suspect or allow for the apprehension.” Id. at 498.06. The policy also permits the use of a canine, however, when any crime—not just a felony or violent crime—has been committed. Id. at 498.05. This permissiveness, combined with the absence of meaningful supervisory review and an apparent tendency to overstate the threat based on race, has resulted in avoidable dog bites to low-level offenders when other means of control were available.
In December 2011, officers deployed a canine to bite an unarmed 14-year-old African-American boy who was waiting in an abandoned house for his friends. Four officers, including a
32
canine officer, responded to the house mid-morning after a caller reported that people had gone inside. Officers arrested one boy on the ground level. Describing the offense as a burglary in progress even though the facts showed that the only plausible offense was trespassing, the canine officer’s report stated that the dog located a second boy hiding in a storage closet under the stairs in the basement. The officer peeked into the space and saw the boy, who was 5’5” and 140 pounds, curled up in a ball, hiding. According to the officer, the boy would not show his hands despite being warned that the officer would use the dog. The officer then deployed the dog, which bit the boy’s arm, causing puncture wounds.
According to the boy, with whom we spoke, he never hid in a storage space and he never heard any police warnings. He told us that he was waiting for his friends in the basement of the house, a vacant building where they would go when they skipped school. The boy approached the stairs when he heard footsteps on the upper level, thinking his friends had arrived. When he saw the dog at the top of the steps, he turned to run, but the dog quickly bit him on the ankle and then the thigh, causing him to fall to the floor. The dog was about to bite his face or neck but instead got his left arm, which the boy had raised to protect himself. FPD officers struck him while he was on the ground, one of them putting a boot on the side of his head. He recalled the officers laughing about the incident afterward.
The lack of sufficient documentation or a supervisory force investigation prevents us from resolving which version of events is more accurate. However, even if the officer’s version of the force used were accurate, the use of the dog to bite the boy was unreasonable. Though described as a felony, the facts as described by the officer, and the boy, indicate that this was a trespass—kids hanging out in a vacant building. The officers had no factual predicate to believe the boy was armed. The offense reports document no attempt to glean useful information about the second boy from the first, who was quickly arrested. By the canine officer’s own account, he saw the boy in the closet and thus had the opportunity to assess the threat posed by this 5’5” 14 year old. Moreover, there were no exigent circumstances requiring apprehension by dog bite. Four officers were present and had control of the scene.
There is a recurring pattern of officers claiming they had to use a canine to extract a suspect hiding in a closed space. The frequency with which this particular rationale is used to justify dog bites, alongside the conclusory language in the reports, provides cause for concern. In December 2012, a 16-year-old African-American boy suspected of stealing a car fled from an officer, jumped several fences, and ran into a vacant house. A second officer arrived with a canine, which reportedly located the suspect hiding in a closet. Without providing a warning outside the closet, the officer opened the door and sent in the dog, which bit the suspect and dragged him out by the legs. This force appears objectively unreasonable. See Kuha v. City of Minnetonka, 365 F.3d 590, 598 (8th Cir. 2004), abrogated on other grounds by Szabla v. City of Brooklyn Park, Minn., 486 F.3d 385, 396 (8th Cir. 2007) (en banc) (holding that “a jury could find it objectively unreasonable to use a police dog trained in the bite and hold method without first giving the suspect a warning and opportunity for peaceful surrender”). The first officer, who was also on the scene by this point, deployed his ECW against the suspect three times as the suspect struggled with the dog, which was still biting him. The offense reports provide only minimal explanation for why apprehension by dog bite was necessary. The pursuing officer claimed the suspect had “reached into the front section of his waist area,” but the report does not
33
say that he relayed this information to the canine officer, and no weapon was found. Moreover, given the lack of a warning at the closet, the use of the dog and ECW at the same time, and the application of three ECW stuns in quick succession, the officers’ conduct raises the possibility that the force was applied in retaliation for leading officers on a chase.
In November 2013, an officer deployed a canine to bite and detain a fleeing subject even though the officer knew the suspect was unarmed. The officer deemed the subject, an African-American male who was walking down the street, suspicious because he appeared to walk away when he saw the officer. The officer stopped him and frisked him, finding no weapons. The officer then ran his name for warrants. When the man heard the dispatcher say over the police radio that he had outstanding warrants—the report does not specify whether the warrants were for failing to appear in municipal court or to pay owed fines, or something more serious—he ran. The officer followed him and released his dog, which bit the man on both arms. The officer’s supervisor found the force justified because the officer released the dog “fearing that the subject was armed,” even though the officer had already determined the man was unarmed.
As these incidents demonstrate, FPD officers’ use of canines to bite people is frequently unreasonable. Officers command dogs to apprehend by biting even when multiple officers are present. They make no attempt to slow situations down, creating time to resolve the situation with lesser force. They appear to use canines not to counter a physical threat but to inflict punishment. They act as if every offender has a gun, justifying their decisions based on what might be possible rather than what the facts indicate is likely. Overall, FPD officers’ use of canines reflects a culture in which officers choose not to use the skills and tactics that could resolve a situation without injuries, and instead deploy tools and methods that are almost guaranteed to produce an injury of some type.
FPD’s use of canines is part of its pattern of excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. In addition, FPD’s use of dog bites only against African-American subjects is evidence of discriminatory policing in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and other federal laws.
c. FPD’s Use of Force Is Sometimes Retaliatory and Punitive
Many FPD uses of force appear entirely punitive. Officers often use force in response to behavior that may be annoying or distasteful but does not pose a threat. The punitive use of force by officers is unconstitutional and, in many cases, criminal. See, e.g., Gibson v. County of Washoe, Nev., 290 F.3d 1175, 1197 (9th Cir. 2002) (“The Due Process clause protects pretrial detainees from the use of excessive force that amounts to punishment.”); see also 18 U.S.C. § 242 (making willful deprivation of rights under color of law, such as by excessive force, a federal felony punishable by up to ten years in prison).
We reviewed many incidents in which it appeared that FPD officers used force not to counter a physical threat but to inflict punishment. The use of canines and ECWs, in particular, appear prone to such abuse by FPD. In April 2013, for example, a correctional officer deployed an ECW against an African-American prisoner, delivering a five-second shock, because the man had urinated out of his cell onto the jail floor. The correctional officer observed the man on his security camera feed inside the booking office. When the officer came out, some of the urine hit
34
his pant leg and, he said, almost caused him to slip. “Due to the possibility of contagion,” the correctional officer claimed, he deployed his ECW “to cease the assault.” The ECW prongs, however, both struck the prisoner in the back. The correctional officer’s claim that he deployed the ECW to stop the ongoing threat of urine is not credible, particularly given that the prisoner was in his locked cell with his back to the officer at the time the ECW was deployed. Using less-lethal force to counter urination, especially when done punitively as appears to be the case here, is unreasonable. See Shumate v. Cleveland, 483 F. App’x 112, 114 (6th Cir. 2012) (affirming denial of summary judgment on an excessive-force claim against an officer who punched a handcuffed arrestee in response to being spit on, when the officer could have protected himself from further spitting by putting the arrestee in the back of a patrol car and closing the door).
d. FPD Use of Force Often Results from Unlawful Arrest and Officer Escalation
A defining aspect of FPD’s pattern of excessive force is the extent to which force results from unlawful stops and arrests, and from officer escalation of incidents. Too often, officers overstep their authority by stopping individuals without reasonable suspicion and arresting without probable cause. Officers frequently compound the harm by using excessive force to effect the unlawful police action. Individuals encountering police under these circumstances are confused and surprised to find themselves being detained. They decline to stop or try to walk away, believing it within their rights to do so. They pull away incredulously, or respond with anger. Officers tend to respond to these reactions with force.
In January 2013, a patrol sergeant stopped an African-American man after he saw the man talk to an individual in a truck and then walk away. The sergeant detained the man, although he did not articulate any reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot. When the man declined to answer questions or submit to a frisk—which the sergeant sought to execute despite articulating no reason to believe the man was armed—the sergeant grabbed the man by the belt, drew his ECW, and ordered the man to comply. The man crossed his arms and objected that he had not done anything wrong. Video captured by the ECW’s built-in camera shows that the man made no aggressive movement toward the officer. The sergeant fired the ECW, applying a five-second cycle of electricity and causing the man to fall to the ground. The sergeant almost immediately applied the ECW again, which he later justified in his report by claiming that the man tried to stand up. The video makes clear, however, that the man never tried to stand—he only writhed in pain on the ground. The video also shows that the sergeant applied the ECW nearly continuously for 20 seconds, longer than represented in his report. The man was charged with Failure to Comply and Resisting Arrest, but no independent criminal violation.
In a January 2014 incident, officers attempted to arrest a young African-American man for trespassing on his girlfriend’s grandparents’ property, even though the man had been invited into the home by the girlfriend. According to officers, he resisted arrest, requiring several officers to subdue him. Seven officers repeatedly struck and used their ECWs against the subject, who was 5’8” and 170 pounds. The young man suffered head lacerations with significant bleeding.
In the above examples, force resulted from temporary detentions or attempted arrests for which officers lacked legal authority. Force at times appeared to be used as punishment for non-
35
compliance with an order that lacked legal authority. Even where FPD officers have legal grounds to stop or arrest, however, they frequently take actions that ratchet up tensions and needlessly escalate the situation to the point that they feel force is necessary. One illustrative instance from October 2012 began as a purported check on a pedestrian’s well-being and ended with the man being taken to the ground, drive-stunned twice, and arrested for Manner of Walking in Roadway and Failure to Comply. In that case, an African-American man was walking after midnight in the outer lane of West Florissant Avenue when an officer asked him to stop. The officer reported that he believed the man might be under the influence of an “impairing substance.” When the man, who was 5’5” and 135 pounds, kept walking, the officer grabbed his arm; when the man pulled away, the officer forced him to the ground. Then, for reasons not articulated in the officer’s report, the officer decided to handcuff the man, applying his ECW in drive-stun mode twice, reportedly because the man would not provide his hand for cuffing. The man was arrested but there is no indication in the report that he was in fact impaired or indeed doing anything other than walking down the street when approached by the officer.
In November 2011, officers stopped a car for speeding. The two African-American women inside exited the car and vocally objected to the stop. They were told to get back in the car. When the woman in the passenger seat got out a second time, an officer announced she was under arrest for Failure to Comply. This decision escalated into a use of force. According to the officers, the woman swung her arms and legs, although apparently not at anyone, and then stiffened her body. An officer responded by drive-stunning her in the leg. The woman was charged with Failure to Comply and Resisting Arrest.
As these examples demonstrate, a significant number of the documented use-of-force incidents involve charges of Failure to Comply and Resisting Arrest only. This means that officers who claim to act based on reasonable suspicion or probable cause of a crime either are wrong much of the time or do not have an adequate legal basis for many stops and arrests in the first place. Cf. Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130, 136 (1974) (Powell, J., concurring) (cautioning that an overbroad code ordinance “tends to be invoked only where there is no other valid basis for arresting an objectionable or suspicious person” and that the “opportunity for abuse . . . is self-evident”). This pattern is a telltale sign of officer escalation and a strong indicator that the use of force was avoidable.
e. FPD Officers Have a Pattern of Resorting to Force Too Quickly When Interacting with Vulnerable Populations
Another dimension of FPD’s pattern of unreasonable force is FPD’s overreliance on force when interacting with more vulnerable populations, such as people with mental health conditions or intellectual disabilities and juvenile students.
i. Force Used Against People with Mental Health Conditions or Intellectual Disabilities
The Fourth Amendment requires that an individual’s mental health condition or intellectual disability be considered when determining the reasonableness of an officer’s use of force. See Champion v. Outlook Nashville, Inc., 380 F.3d 893, 904 (6th Cir. 2004) (explaining in
36
case concerning use of force against a detainee with autism that “he diminished capacity of an unarmed detainee must be taken into account when assessing the amount of force exerted”); see also Phillips v. Community Ins. Corp., 678 F.3d 513, 526 (7th Cir. 2012); Deorle v. Rutherford, 272 F.3d 1272, 1283 (9th Cir. 2001); Giannetti v. City of Stillwater, 216 F. App’x 756, 764 (10th Cir. 2007). This is because people with such disabilities “may be physically unable to comply with police commands.” Phillips, 678 F.3d at 526. Our review indicates that FPD officers do not adequately consider the mental health or cognitive disability of those they suspect of wrongdoing when deciding whether to use force.
Ferguson is currently in litigation against the estate of a man with mental illness who died in September 2011 after he had an ECW deployed against him three times for allegedly running toward an officer while swinging his fist. See Estate of Moore v. Ferguson Police Dep't, No. 4:14-cv-01443 (E.D. Mo. filed Aug. 19, 2014). The man had been running naked through the streets and pounding on cars that morning while yelling “I am Jesus.” The Eighth Circuit recently considered a similar set of allegations in De Boise v. Taser Intern., Inc., 760 F.3d 892 (8th Cir. 2014). There, a man suffering from schizophrenia, who had run naked in and out of his house and claimed to be a god, died after officers used their ECWs against him multiple times because he would not stay on the ground. Id. at 897-98. Although the court resolved the case on qualified immunity grounds without deciding the excessive-force issue, the one judge who reached that issue opined that the allegations could be sufficient to establish a Fourth Amendment violation. Id. at 899-900 (Bye, J., dissenting).
In 2013, FPD stopped a man running with a shopping cart because he seemed “suspicious.” According to the file, the man was “obviously mentally handicapped.” Officers took the man to the ground and attempted to arrest him for Failure to Comply after he refused to submit to a pat-down. In the officers’ view, the man resisted arrest by pulling his arms away. The officers drive-stunned him in the side of the neck. They charged him only with Failure to Comply and Resisting Arrest. In August 2011, officers used an ECW device against a man with diabetes who bit an EMT’s hand without breaking the skin. The man had been having seizures when he did not comply with officer commands.
In August 2010, an officer responded to a call about an African-American man walking onto the highway and lying down on the pavement. Seeing that the man was sweating, acting jittery, and had dilated pupils, the officer believed he was on drugs. The man was cooperative at first but balked, pushing the officer back when the officer tried to handcuff him for safety reasons. The officer struck the man several times with his Asp® baton—including once in the head, a form of deadly force—causing significant bleeding. Two other officers then deployed their ECWs against the man a total of five times.
Jail staff have also reacted to people with mental health conditions by resorting to greater force than necessary. For example, in July 2011, a correctional officer used an ECW to drive-stun an African-American male inmate three times after he tried to hang himself with material torn from a medical dressing and banged his head on the cell wall. That same month, a correctional officer used an ECW against an African-American inmate with bipolar disorder who broke the overhead glass light fixture and tried to use it to cut his wrists. According to the correctional officer, the glass was “safety glass” and could not be used to cut the skin.

These incidents indicate a pattern of insufficient sensitivity to, and training about, the limitations of those with mental health conditions or intellectual disabilities. Officers view mental illness as narcotic intoxication, or worse, willful defiance. They apply excessive force to such subjects, not accounting for the possibility that the subjects may not understand their commands or be able to comply with them. And they have been insufficiently trained on tactics that would minimize force when dealing with individuals who are in mental health crisis or who have intellectual disabilities.
ii. Force Used Against Students
FPD’s approach to policing impacts how its officers interact with students, as well, leading them to treat routine discipline issues as criminal matters and to use force when communication and de-escalation techniques would likely resolve the conflict.
FPD stations two School Resource Officers in the Ferguson-Florissant School District,19 one at Ferguson Middle School and one at McCluer South-Berkeley High School. The stated mission of the SRO program, according to the memorandum of understanding between FPD and the school district, is to provide a safe and secure learning environment for students. But that agreement does not clearly define the SROs’ role or limit SRO involvement in cases of routine discipline or classroom management. Nor has FPD established such guidance for its SROs or provided officers with adequate training on engaging with youth in an educational setting. The result of these failures, combined with FPD’s culture of unreasonable enforcement actions more generally, is police action that is unreasonable for a school environment.
For example, in November 2013, an SRO charged a ninth grade girl with several violations after she refused to follow his orders to walk to the principal’s office. The student and a classmate, both 15-year-old African-American girls, had gotten into a fight during class. When the officer responded, school staff had the two girls separated in a hallway. One refused the officer’s order to walk to the principal’s office, instead trying to push past staff toward the other girl. The officer pushed her backward toward a row of lockers and then announced that she was under arrest for Failure to Comply. Although the officer agreed not to handcuff her when she agreed to walk to the principals’ office, he forwarded charges of Failure to Comply, Resisting Arrest, and Peace Disturbance to the county family court. The other student was charged with Peace Disturbance.
FPD officers respond to misbehavior common among students with arrest and force, rather than reserving arrest for cases involving safety threats. As one SRO told us, the arrests he made during the 2013-14 school year overwhelmingly involved minor offenses—Disorderly Conduct, Peace Disturbance, and Failure to Comply with instructions. In one case, an SRO decided to arrest a 14-year-old African-American student at the Ferguson Middle School for Failure to Comply when the student refused to leave the classroom after getting into a trivial argument with another student. The situation escalated, resulting in the student being drive-

stunned with an ECW in the classroom and the school seeking a 180-day suspension for the student. SROs’ propensity for arresting students demonstrates a lack of understanding of the negative consequences associated with such arrests. In fact, SROs told us that they viewed increased arrests in the schools as a positive result of their work. This perspective suggests a failure of training (including training in mental health, counseling, and the development of the teenage brain); a lack of priority given to de-escalation and conflict resolution; and insufficient appreciation for the negative educational and long-term outcomes that can result from treating disciplinary concerns as crimes and using force on students. See Dear Colleague Letter on the Nondiscriminatory Administration of School Discipline, U.S. Dep’t of Justice & U.S. Dep’t of Education, http://www.justice.gov/crt/about/edu/documents/dcl.pdf (2014) (citing research and providing guidance to public schools on how to comply with federal nondiscrimination law).
f. FPD’s Weak Oversight of Use of Force Reflects its Lack of Concern for Whether Officer Conduct Is Consistent with the Law or Promotes Police Legitimacy
FPD’s use-of-force review system is particularly ineffectual. Force frequently is not reported. When it is, there is rarely any meaningful review. Supervisors do little to no investigation; either do not understand or choose not to follow FPD’s use-of-force policy in analyzing officer conduct; rarely correct officer misconduct when they find it; and do not see the patterns of abuse that are evident when viewing these incidents in the aggregate.
While Chief Jackson implemented new department policies when he joined FPD in 2010, including on use-of-force reporting and review, these policies are routinely ignored. Under FPD General Order 410.00, when an officer uses or attempts to use any force, a supervisor must respond to the scene to investigate. The supervisor must complete a two-page use-of-force report assessing whether the use of force complied with FPD’s force policy. Additional forms are required for ECW uses and vehicle pursuits. According to policy and our interviews with Chief Jackson, a use-of-force packet is assembled—which should include the use-of-force report and supplemental forms, all police reports, any photographs, and any other supporting materials—and forwarded up the chain of command to the Chief. The force reporting and review system is intended to “help identify trends, improve training and officer safety, and provide timely information for the department addressing use-of-force issues with the public.” FPD General Order 410.07. The policy even requires that a professional standards officer conduct an annual review of all force incidents. Id. These requirements are not adhered to in practice.
Perhaps the greatest deviation from FPD’s use-of-force policies is that officers frequently do not report the force they use at all. There are many indications that this underreporting is widespread. First, we located information in FPD’s internal affairs files indicating instances of force that were not included in the force files provided by FPD. Second, in reviewing randomly selected reports from FPD’s records management system, we found several offense reports that described officers using force with no corresponding use-of-force report. Third, we found evidence that force had been used but not documented in officers’ workers compensation claims. Of the nine cases between 2010 and 2014 in which officers claimed injury sustained from using force on the job, three had no corresponding use-of-force paperwork. Fourth, the set of force investigations provided by FPD contains lengthy gaps, including six stretches of time ranging
39
from two to four months in which no incidents of force are reported. Otherwise, the files typically reflect between two and six force incidents per month. Fifth, we heard from community members about uses of force that do not appear within FPD’s records, and we learned of many uses of force that were never officially reported or investigated from reviewing emails between FPD supervisors. Finally, FPD’s force files reflect an overrepresentation of ECW uses—a type of force that creates a physical record (a spent ECW cartridge with discharged confetti) and that requires a separate form be filled out. It is much easier for officers to use physical blows and baton strikes without documenting them. Thus, the evidence indicates that a significant amount of force goes unreported within FPD. This in turn raises the possibility that the pattern of unreasonable force is even greater than we found.
Even when force is reported, the force review process falls so short of FPD’s policy requirements that it is ineffective at improving officer safety or ensuring that force is used properly. First, and most significantly, supervisors almost never actually investigate force incidents. In almost every case, supervisors appear to view force investigations as a ministerial task, merely summarizing the involved officers’ version of events and sometimes relying on the officers’ offense report alone. The supervisory review starts and ends with the presumption that the officer’s version of events is truthful and that the force was reasonable. As a consequence, though contrary to policy, supervisors almost never interview non-police witnesses, such as the arrestee or any independent witnesses. They do not review critical evidence even when it is readily available. For example, a significant portion of the documented uses of force occurs at the Ferguson jail, which employs surveillance cameras to monitor the area. Yet FPD records provide no indication that a supervisor has ever sought to review the footage for a jail incident. Nor do supervisors examine ECW camera video, even though it is available in FPD’s newer model ECWs. Sometimes, supervisors provide no remarks on the use-of-force report, indicating simply, “see offense report.”
Our review found the record to be replete with examples of this lack of meaningful supervisory review of force. For example, the use-of-force report for a May 2013 incident states that a suspect claims he had an ECW deployed against him and that he was punched in the head and face. The supervisor concludes simply, “other than the drive stun, no use of force was performed by the officers.” The report does not clarify what investigation the supervisor did, if any, to assess the suspect’s allegations, or how he determined that the allegations were false. Supervisors also fail to provide recommendations for how to ensure officer safety and minimize the need for force going forward. In January 2014, for instance, a correctional officer used force to subdue an inmate who tried to escape while the correctional officer was moving the inmate’s cellmate to another cell without assistance. The supervisor missed the opportunity to recommend that correctional officers not act alone in such risky situations.
Second, supervisors either do not understand or choose not to follow FPD’s use-of-force policy. As discussed above, in many of the force incidents we reviewed, it is clear from the officers’ offense reports that the force used was, at the very least, contrary to FPD policy. Nonetheless, based on records provided by FPD, it appears that first-line supervisors and the command staff found all but one of the 151 incidents we reviewed to be within policy. This includes the instances of unreasonable ECW use discussed above. FPD policy advises that ECWs are to be used to “overcome active aggression or overt actions of assault.” FPD General
40
Order 499.00. They are to be used to “avert a potentially injurious or dangerous situation,” and never “punitively or for purposes of coercion.” FPD General Order 499.04. Simply referring back to these policies should have made clear to supervisors that the many uses of ECWs against subjects who were merely argumentative or passively resistant violated policy.
For example, in April 2014, an intoxicated jail detainee climbed up on the bars in his cell and refused to get down when ordered to by the arresting officer and the correctional officer on duty. The correctional officer then fired an ECW at him, from outside the closed cell door, striking the detainee in the chest and causing him to fall to the ground. In addition to being excessive, this force violated explicit FPD policy that “roper consideration and care should be taken when deploying the X26 TASER on subjects who are in an elevated position or in other circumstance where a fall may cause substantial injury or death.” FPD General Order 499.04. The reviewing supervisor deemed the use of force within policy.
Supervisors seem to believe that any level of resistance justifies any level of force. They routinely rely on boilerplate language, such as the statement that the subject took “a fighting stance,” to justify force. Such language is not specific enough to understand the specific behavior the officer encountered and thus to determine whether the officer’s response was reasonable. Indeed, a report from September 2010 shows how such terms may obscure what happened. In that case, the supervisor wrote that the subject “turned to  in a fighting stance” even though the officer’s report makes clear that he chased and tackled the subject as the subject fled. That particular use of force may have been reasonable, but the use-of-force report reveals how little attention supervisors give to their force investigations. Another common justification, frequently offered by officers who use ECWs to subdue individuals who do not readily put their hands behind their back after being put on the ground, is to claim that a subject’s hands were near his waist, where he might have a weapon. Supervisors tend to accept this justification without question.
Third, the review process breaks down even further when officers at the sergeant level or above use force. Instead of reporting their use of force to an official higher up the chain, who could evaluate it objectively, they complete the use-of-force investigation themselves. We found several examples of supervisors investigating their own conduct. When force investigations are conducted by the very officers involved in the incidents, the department is less likely to identify policy and constitutional violations, and the public is less likely to trust the department’s commitment to policing itself.
Fourth, the failure of supervisors to investigate and the absence of analysis from their use-of-force reports frustrate review up the chain of command. Lieutenants, the assigned captain, and the Police Chief typically receive at most a one- or two-paragraph summary from supervisors; no witness statements, photographs, or video footage that should have been obtained during the investigation is included. These reviewers are left to rely only on the offense report and the sergeant’s cursory summary. To take one example, 21 officers responded to a fight at the high school in March 2013, and several of them used force to take students into custody. FPD records contain only one offense report, which does not describe the actions of all officers who used force. The use-of-force report identifies the involved officers as “multiple” (without names) and provides only a one-paragraph summary stating that students “were grabbed,
41
handcuffed, and restrained using various techniques of control.” The offense report reflects that officers collected video from the school’s security cameras, but the supervisor apparently never reviewed it. Further, while the offense report contains witness statements, those statements relate to the underlying fight, not the officer use of force, and there appear to be no statements from any of the 21 officers who responded to the fight. It is not possible for higher-level supervisors to adequately assess uses of force with so little information.
In fact, although a use-of-force packet is supposed to include all related documents, in practice only the two-page use-of-force report, that is, the supervisor’s brief summary of the incident, goes to the Chief. In the example from the high school, then, the Chief would have known only that there was a fight at the school and that force was used—not which officers used force, what type of force was used, or what the students did to warrant the use of force. Offense reports are available in FPD’s records management system, but Chief Jackson told us he rarely retrieves them when reviewing uses of force. The Chief also told us that he has never overturned a supervisor’s determination of whether a use of force fell within FPD policy.
Finally, FPD does not perform any comprehensive review of force incidents sufficient to detect patterns of misconduct by a particular officer or unit, or patterns regarding a particular type of force. Indeed, FPD does not keep records in a manner that would allow for such a review. Within FPD’s paper storage system, the two-page use-of-force reports (which are usually handwritten) are kept separately from all other documentation, including ECW and pursuit forms for the same incidents. Offense reports are attached to some use-of-force reports but not others. Some use-of-force reports have been removed from FPD’s set of force files because the incidents became the subjects of an internal investigation or a lawsuit. As a consequence, when FPD provided us what it considers to be its force files—which, as described above, we have reason to believe do not capture all actual force incidents—a majority of those files were missing a critical document, such as an offense report, ECW report, or the use-of-force report itself. We had to make repeated requests for documents to construct force files amenable to fair review. There were some documents that FPD was unable to locate, even after repeated requests.
With its records incomplete and scattered, the department is unable to implement an early intervention system to identify officers who tend to use excessive force or the need for more training or better equipment—goals explicitly set out by FPD policy. It appears that no annual review of force incidents is conducted, as required by FPD General Order 410.07; indeed, a meaningful annual audit would be impossible. These recordkeeping problems also explain why Chief Jackson told us he could not remember ever imposing discipline for an improper use of force or ordering further training based on force problems.
These deficiencies in use-of-force review can have serious consequences. They make it less likely that officers will be held accountable for excessive force and more likely that constitutional violations will occur. They create potentially devastating liability for the City for failing to put in place systems to ensure officers operate within the bounds of the law. And they result in a police department that does not give its officers the supervision they need to do their jobs safely, effectively, and constitutionally.

B. Ferguson’s Municipal Court Practices
The Ferguson municipal court handles most charges brought by FPD, and does so not with the primary goal of administering justice or protecting the rights of the accused, but of maximizing revenue. The impact that revenue concerns have on court operations undermines the court’s role as a fair and impartial judicial body.20 Our investigation has uncovered substantial evidence that the court’s procedures are constitutionally deficient and function to impede a person’s ability to challenge or resolve a municipal charge, resulting in unnecessarily prolonged cases and an increased likelihood of running afoul of court requirements. At the same time, the court imposes severe penalties when a defendant fails to meet court requirements, including added fines and fees and arrest warrants that are unnecessary and run counter to public safety. These practices both reflect and reinforce an approach to law enforcement in Ferguson that violates the Constitution and undermines police legitimacy and community trust.
Ferguson’s municipal court practices combine to cause significant harm to many individuals who have cases pending before the court. Our investigation has found overwhelming evidence of minor municipal code violations resulting in multiple arrests, jail time, and payments that exceed the cost of the original ticket many times over. One woman, discussed above, received two parking tickets for a single violation in 2007 that then totaled $151 plus fees. Over seven years later, she still owed Ferguson $541—after already paying $550 in fines and fees, having multiple arrest warrants issued against her, and being arrested and jailed on several occasions. Another woman told us that when she went to court to try to pay $100 on a $600 outstanding balance, the Court Clerk refused to take the partial payment, even though the woman explained that she was a single mother and could not afford to pay more that month. A 90-year-old man had a warrant issued for his arrest after he failed to timely pay the five citations FPD issued to him during a single traffic stop in 2013. An 83-year-old man had a warrant issued against him when he failed to timely resolve his Derelict Auto violation. A 67-year-old woman told us she was stopped and arrested by a Ferguson police officer for an outstanding warrant for failure to pay a trash-removal citation. She did not know about the warrant until her arrest, and the court ultimately charged her $1,000 in fines, which she continues to pay off in $100 monthly increments despite being on a limited, fixed income. We have heard similar stories from dozens of other individuals and have reviewed court records documenting many additional instances of similarly harsh penalties, often for relatively minor violations.
Our review of police and court records suggests that much of the harm of Ferguson’s law enforcement practices in recent years is attributable to the court’s routine use of arrest warrants to secure collection and compliance when a person misses a required court appearance or payment. In a case involving a moving violation, procedural failures also result in the suspension of the defendant’s license. And, until recently, the court regularly imposed a separate Failure to Appear charge for missed appearances and payments; that charge resulted in an additional fine in the amount of $75.50, plus $26.50 in court costs. See Ferguson Mun. Code § 13-58 (repealed Sept. 23, 2014). During the last three years, the court imposed roughly one Failure to Appear charge per every two citations or summonses issued by FPD. Since at least
20 The influence of revenue on the court, described both in Part II and in Part III.B. of this Report, may itself be unlawful. See Ward v. Vill. of Monroeville, 409 U.S. 57, 58-62 (1972) (finding a violation of the due process right to a fair and impartial trial where a town mayor served as judge and was also responsible for the town’s finances, which were substantially dependent on “fines, forfeitures, costs, and fees” collected by the court).
43
2010, the court has collected more revenue for Failure to Appear charges than for any other charge. This includes $442,901 in fines for Failure to Appear violations in 2013, which comprised 24% of the total revenue the court collected that year. While the City Council repealed the Failure to Appear ordinance in September 2014, many people continue to owe fines and fees stemming from that charge. And the court continues to issue arrest warrants in every case where that charge previously would have been applied. License suspension practices are similarly unchanged. Once issued, arrest warrants can, and frequently do, lead to arrest and time in jail, despite the fact that the underlying offense did not result in a penalty of imprisonment.21
Thus, while the municipal court does not generally deem the code violations that come before it as jail-worthy, it routinely views the failure to appear in court to remit payment to the City as jail-worthy, and commonly issues warrants to arrest individuals who have failed to make timely payment. Similarly, while the municipal court does not have any authority to impose a fine of over $1,000 for any offense, it is not uncommon for individuals to pay more than this amount to the City of Ferguson—in forfeited bond payments, additional Failure to Appear charges, and added court fees—for what may have begun as a simple code violation. In this way, the penalties that the court imposes are driven not by public safety needs, but by financial interests. And despite the harm imposed by these needless penalties, until recently, the City and court did little to respond to the increasing frequency of Failure to Appear charges, and in many respects made court practices more opaque and difficult to navigate.
1. Court Practices Impose Substantial and Unnecessary Barriers to the Challenge or Resolution of Municipal Code Violations
It is a hallmark of due process that individuals are entitled to adequate notice of the allegations made against them and to a meaningful opportunity to be heard. See Cole v. Arkansas, 333 U.S. 196, 201 (1948); see also Ward v. Vill. of Monroeville, 409 U.S. 57, 58-62 (1972) (applying due process requirements to case adjudicated by municipal traffic court). As documented below, however, Ferguson municipal court rules and procedures often fail to provide these basic protections, imposing unnecessary barriers to resolving a citation or summons and thus increasing the likelihood of incurring the severe penalties that result if a code violation is not quickly resolved.
We have concerns not only about the obstacles to resolving a charge even when an individual chooses not to contest it, but also about the trial processes that apply in the rare occasion that a person does attempt to challenge a charge. While it is “axiomatic that a fair trial in a fair tribunal is a basic requirement of due process,” Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co., Inc., 556 U.S. 868, 876 (2009), the adjudicative tribunal provided by the Ferguson municipal court appears deficient in many respects.22 Attempts to raise legal claims are met with retaliatory conduct. In an August 2012 email exchange, for instance, the Court Clerk asked what the
21 As with many of the problematic court practices that we identify in this report, other municipalities in St. Louis County also have imposed a separate Failure to Appear charge, fine, and fee for missed court appearances and payments. Many continue to do so.
22 As discussed in Part II of this report, City officials have acknowledged several of these procedural deficiencies. In 2012, a City Councilmember, citing specific examples, urged against reappointing Judge Brockmeyer because he “often times does not listen to the testimony, does not review the reports or the criminal history of defendants, and doesn’t let all the pertinent witnesses testify before rendering a verdict.”
44
Prosecuting Attorney does when an attorney appears in a red light camera case, and the Prosecuting Attorney responded: “I usually dismiss them if the attorney merely requests a recommendation. If the attorney goes off on all of the constitutional stuff, then I tell the attorney to come . . . and argue in front  the judge—after that, his client can pay the ticket.” We have found evidence of similar adverse action taken against litigants attempting to fulsomely argue a case at trial. The man discussed above who was cited after allowing his child to urinate in a bush attempted to challenge his charges. The man retained counsel who, during trial, was repeatedly interrupted by the court during his cross-examination of the officer. When the attorney objected to the interruptions, the judge told him that, if he continued on this path, “I will hold you in contempt and I will incarcerate you,” which, as discussed below, the court has done in the past to others appearing before it. The attorney told us that, believing no line of questioning would alter the outcome, he tempered his defense so as not to be jailed. Notably, at that trial, even though the testifying officer had previously been found untruthful during an official FPD investigation, the prosecuting attorney presented his testimony without informing defendant of that fact, and the court credited that testimony.23 The evidence thus suggests substantial deficiencies in the manner in which the court conducts trials.
Even where defendants opt not to challenge their charges, a number of court processes make resolving a case exceedingly difficult. City officials and FPD officers we spoke with nearly uniformly asserted that individuals’ experiences when they become embroiled in Ferguson’s municipal code enforcement are due not to any failings in Ferguson’s law enforcement practices, but rather to those individuals’ lack of “personal responsibility.” But these statements ignore the barriers to resolving a case that court practices impose, including: 1) a lack of transparency regarding rights and responsibilities; 2) requiring in-person appearance to resolve most municipal charges; 3) policies that exacerbate the harms of Missouri’s law requiring license suspension where a person fails to appear on a moving violation charge; 4) basic access deficiencies that frustrate a person’s ability to resolve even those charges that do not require in-court appearance; and 5) legally inadequate fine assessment methods that do not appropriately consider a person’s ability to pay and do not provide alternatives to fines for those living in or near poverty. Together, these barriers impose considerable hardship. We have heard repeated reports, and found evidence in court records, of people appearing in court many times—
23 This finding of untruthfulness by a police officer constitutes impeachment evidence that must be disclosed in any trial in which the officer testifies for the City. Under the Fourteenth Amendment, the failure to disclose evidence that is “favorable to an accused” violates due process “where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.” Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963). This duty applies to impeachment evidence, United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 676 (1985), and it applies even if the defendant does not request the evidence, United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 107 (1976). The duty encompasses, furthermore, information that should be known to the prosecutor, including information known solely by the police department. Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 437 (1995). This constitutional duty to disclose appears to extend to municipal court cases, which can result in jail terms of up to three months under Section 29-2 of Ferguson’s municipal code. See City of Kansas City v. Oxley, 579 S.W.2d 113, 114 (Mo. 1979) (en banc) (holding that the due process standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt applied in a municipal court speeding case because “the violation has criminal overtones”); see also City of Cape Girardeau v. Jones, 725 S.W.2d 904, 907-09 (Mo. Ct. App. 1987) (explaining that reasonable doubt standard applied to municipal trespass prosecution because municipal ordinance violations are “quasi-criminal,” and reversing two convictions based on privilege against self-incrimination). We are aware of at least two cases, from January 2015, in which the City called this officer as a witness without disclosing the finding of untruthfulness to the defense.
45
in some instances on more than ten occasions—to try to resolve a case but being unable to do so, and subsequently having additional fines, fees, and arrest warrants issued against them.
a. Court Practices and Procedural Deficiencies Create a Lack of Transparency Regarding Rights and Responsibilities
It is often difficult for an individual who receives a municipal citation or summons in Ferguson to know how much is owed, where and how to pay the ticket, what the options for payment are, what rights the individual has, and what the consequences are for various actions or oversights. The initial information provided to people who are cited for violating Ferguson’s municipal code is often incomplete or inconsistent. Communication with municipal court defendants is haphazard and known by the court to be unreliable. And the court’s procedures and operations are ambiguous, are not written down, and are not transparent or even available to the public on the court’s website or elsewhere.
The rules and procedures of the court are difficult for the public to discern. Aside from a small number of exceptions, the Municipal Judge issues rules of practice and procedure verbally and on an ad hoc basis. Until recently, on the rare occasion that the Judge issued a written order that altered court practices, those orders were not distributed broadly to court and other FPD officials whose actions they affect and were not readily accessible to the public. Further, Ferguson, unlike other courts in the region, does not include any information about its operations on its website other than inaccurate instructions about how to make payment.24 Court staff acknowledged during our investigation that the public would benefit from increased information about how to resolve cases and about court practices and procedures. Yet neither the court nor other City officials have undertaken efforts to make court operations more transparent in order to ensure that litigants understand their rights or court procedures, or to enable the public to assess whether the court is operating in a fair manner.
Current court practices fail to provide adequate information even to those who are charged with a municipal violation. The lack of clarity about a person’s rights and responsibilities often begins from the moment a person is issued a citation. For some offenses, FPD uses state of Missouri uniform citations, and typically indicates on the ticket the assigned court date for the offense. Many times, however, FPD officers omit critical information from the citation, which makes it impossible for a person to determine the specific nature of the offense charged, the amount of the fine owed, or whether a court appearance is required or some alternative method of payment is available. In some cases, citations fail to indicate the offense charged altogether; in November 2013, for instance, court staff wrote FPD patrol to “see what  ticket was for” because it “does not have a charge on it.” In other cases, a ticket will indicate a charge but omit other crucial information. For example, speeding tickets often fail to indicate the alleged speed observed, even though both the fine owed and whether a court appearance is mandatory depends upon the specific speed alleged. Evidence shows that in some of these cases,
24 See City Courts, City of Ferguson, http://www.fergusoncity.com/60/The-City-Of-Ferguson-Municipal-Courts (last visited Feb. 26, 2015). By contrast, the neighboring municipality of Normandy operates a court website with an entire page containing information regarding fine due dates, methods of payment, and different payment options, including the availability of payment plans for those who cannot afford to pay a fine in full. See How Do I Pay a Ticket / Fine?, City of Normandy, http://www.cityofnormandy.gov/index.aspx?NID=570 (last visited Feb. 26, 2015).
46
a person has appeared in court but been unable to resolve the citation because of the missing information. In June 2014, for instance, a court clerk wrote to an FPD officer: “The above ticket . . . does not have a speed in it. The guy came in and we had to send him away. Can you email me the speed when you get time.” Separate and apart from the difficulties these omissions create for people, the fact that the court staff routinely add the speed to tickets weeks after they are issued raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of officers’ assertions in official records.
We have also found evidence that in issuing citations, FPD officers frequently provide people with incorrect information about the date and time of their assigned court session. In November 2012, court staff emailed the two patrol lieutenants asking: “Would you please be so kind to tell your squads to check their ct. dates and times. We are getting quite a few wrong dates and times .” In December 2012, a court clerk emailed an FPD officer to inform him that while he had been putting 6:00 p.m. on his citations that month, the scheduled court session was actually a morning session. More recently, in March 2014, an officer wrote a court clerk because the officer had issued a citation that listed the court date as ten days later than the actual court date assigned. Some of these emails indicate that court staff planned to send a letter to the person who was cited. As noted below, however, such letters often are returned to the court as undeliverable. It is thus unsurprising that, on one occasion, a City employee who works in the building where court was held wrote the Court Clerk to tell her that “ few people stopped by tonight looking for court and I referred them to you.” The email notes that one person insisted on providing her information so the employee could “vouch for her appearance for Night Court.” The email does not identify any other individual who showed up for court that night, nor does it state that any steps were taken to ensure that those assigned the incorrect court date did not have Failure to Appear charges and fines imposed, arrest warrants issued against them, or their licenses suspended.
Even if the citation a person receives has been properly filled out, it is often unclear whether a court appearance is required or if some other method of resolving a case is available. Ferguson has a schedule that establishes fixed fines for a limited number of violations that do not require court appearance. Nonetheless, this list—called the “TVB” or “Traffic Violations Bureau” list—is incomplete and does not provide sufficient clarity regarding whether a court appearance is mandatory. Court staff members have themselves informed us that there are certain offenses for which they will sometimes require a court appearance and other times not, depending on their own assessment of whether an appearance should be required in a given case. That information, however, is not reliably communicated to the person who has been given the citation.
Although the City of Ferguson frequently bears responsibility for giving people misinformation about when they must appear in court, Ferguson does little to ensure that persons who have missed a court date are properly notified of the consequences that result from an additional missed appearance, such as arrest or losing their driver’s licenses, or that those consequences have already been levied. If a person misses a required appearance, it is the purported practice of court staff to send a letter that sets a new court date and informs the defendant that missing the next appearance will result in an arrest warrant being issued. But court staff do not even claim to send these letters before issuing warrants if an individual is on a payment plan and misses a payment, or if a person already has an outstanding warrant on a
47
different offense; in those cases, the court issues a warrant after a single missed payment or appearance. Further, even for the cases in which the court says it does send such letters prior to issuing a warrant, court records suggest that those letters are often not actually sent. Even where a letter is sent, some are returned to court, and court staff told us that in those cases, they make no additional effort to notify the individual of the new court date or the consequences of non-appearance. Court staff and staff from other municipal courts have informed us that defendants in poverty are more likely not to receive such a letter from court because they frequently change residence.
If an individual misses a second court date, an arrest warrant is issued, without any confirmation that the individual received notice of that second court date. In the past, when the court issued a warrant it would also send notice to the individual that a warrant was issued against them and telling them to appear at the police department to resolve the matter. This notice did not provide the basis of the arrest warrant or describe how it might be resolved. In any case, Ferguson stopped providing even this incomplete notice in 2012. In explaining the decision to stop sending this warrant notice, the Court Clerk wrote in a June 2011 email to Chief Jackson that “this will save the cost of warrant cards and postage” and “it is not necessary to send out these cards.” Some court employees, however, told us that the notice letter had been useful—at least for those who received it—and that they believe it should still be sent. That the court discontinued what little notice it was providing to people in advance of issuing a warrant is particularly troubling given that, during our investigation, we spoke with several individuals who were arrested without ever knowing that a warrant was outstanding.25
Once a warrant is issued, a person can clear the warrant by appearing at the court window in the police department and paying a pre-determined bond. However, that process is itself not communicated to the public and, in any case, is only useful if an individual knows there is a warrant for her or his arrest. Court clerks told us that in some cases they deem sympathetic in their own discretion, they will cancel the warrant without a bond. Further, it appears that if a person is aware of an outstanding warrant but believes that the warrant was issued in error, that person can petition the Municipal Judge to cancel the warrant only after the bond is paid in full. If a person cannot afford to pay the bond, there is no opportunity to seek recourse from the court.
If a person is arrested on an outstanding warrant—or as the result of an encounter with FPD—it is often difficult to secure release with a bond payment, not only because of the inordinately high bond amounts discussed below, but also because of procedural obstacles. In practice, bond procedures depart from those articulated in official policy, and are arbitrary and confusing. FPD staff have told us that correctional officers have at times tried to find a warrant in the court’s files to determine the bond amount owed, but have been unable to do so. This is unsurprising given the existence of what has been described to us as “drawers and drawers of warrants.” In some cases, people have attempted to pay a bond to secure the release of a family
25 Prior to September 2014, a second missed court appearance (or a single missed payment) would result not only in a warrant being issued, but also the imposition of an additional Failure to Appear charge. This charge was imposed automatically. It does not appear that there was any attempt by the court to inform individuals that a failure to appear could be excused upon a showing of good cause, or to provide individuals with an opportunity to make such a showing. Additionally, just as the court does not currently send any notice informing a defendant that an arrest warrant has been issued, the court did not send any notice that this additional Failure to Appear charge had been brought.

member in FPD custody, but were not even seen by FPD staff. On one occasion, an FPD staff member reported to an FPD captain that a person “came to the station last night and waited to post bond for , from 1:00 until 3:30. No one ever came up to get her money and no one informed her that she was going to have to wait that long.”
b. Needlessly Requiring In-Court Appearances for Most Code Violations Imposes Unnecessary Obstacles to Resolving Cases
Ferguson requires far more defendants to appear in court than is required under state law. Under Missouri Supreme Court rules, there is a short list of violations that require the violator’s appearance in court: any violation resulting in personal injury or property damage; driving while intoxicated; driving without a proper license; and attempting to elude a police officer. See Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 37.49. The municipal judge of each court has the discretion to expand this list of “must appears,” and Ferguson’s municipal court has expanded it exponentially: of 376 actively charged municipal offenses, court staff informed us that approximately 229 typically require an appearance in court before the fine can be paid, including Dog Creating Nuisance, Equipment Violations, No Passing Zone, Housing – Overgrown Vegetation, and Failure to Remove Leaf Debris. Ferguson requires these court appearances regardless of whether the individual is contesting the charges.
Requiring an individual to appear at a specific place and time to pay a citation makes it far more likely that the individual will fail to appear or pay the citation on time, quickly resulting, in Ferguson, in an arrest warrant and a suspended license. Even setting aside the fact that people often receive inaccurate information about when they must appear in court, the in-person appearance requirement imposes particular difficulties on low-wage workers, single parents, and those with limited access to reliable transportation. Requiring an individual to appear in court also imposes particular burdens on those with jobs that have set hours that may conflict with an assigned court session. Court sessions are sometimes set during the workday and sometimes in the early evening. Additionally, while court dates can be set for several months after the citation was issued, in some cases they can also be issued as early as a week after a citation is received. For example, court staff have instructed FPD officers that derelict auto violations must be set for the “very next court date even if it is just a week . . . or so away.” This can add an additional obstacle for those with firmly established employment schedules.
There are also historical reasons, of which the City is well-aware, that many Ferguson residents may not appear in court. Some individuals fear that if they cannot immediately pay the fines they owe, they will be arrested and sent to jail. Ferguson court staff members told us that they believe the high number of missed court appearances in their court is attributable, in part, to this popular belief. These fears are well founded. While Judge Brockmeyer has told us that he has never sentenced someone to jail time for being unable to pay a fine, we have found evidence that the Judge has held people appearing in court for contempt on account of their unwillingness to answer questions and sentenced those individuals to jail time. In December 2013, the FPD officer assigned to provide security at a court session directly emailed the City Manager to provide notice that “Judge Brockmeyer ordered  arrested tonight after  refused to answer any questions and told the Judge that he had no jurisdiction. This happened on two separate occasions and with the second occasion when  continued with his refusal
49
to answer the Judge, he was order to be arrested and held for 10 days.”26 We also spoke with a woman who told us that, after asking questions in court, FPD officers arrested her for Contempt of Court at the instructions of the Court Clerk. Moreover, we have also received a report of an FPD officer arresting an individual at court for an outstanding warrant. In that instance, which occurred in April 2014, the individual—who was in court to make a fine payment—was approached by an FPD officer, asked to step outside of the court session, and was immediately arrested. In addition, as Ferguson’s Municipal Judge confirmed, it is not uncommon for him to add charges and assess additional fines when a defendant challenges the citation that brought the defendant into court. Appearing in court in Ferguson also requires waits that can stretch into hours, sometimes outdoors in inclement weather. Many individuals report being treated dismissively, or worse, by court staff and the Municipal Judge.
Further, as Ferguson officials have told us, many people have experience with the numerous other municipal courts in St. Louis County that informs individuals’ expectations about the Ferguson municipal court. Our investigation shows that other municipalities in the area have engaged in a number of practices that have the effect of discouraging people from attending court sessions. For instance, court clerks from other municipalities have told us that they have seen judges order people arrested if they appear in court with an outstanding warrant but are unable to pay the fine owed or post the bond amount listed on the warrant. Indeed, one municipal judge from a neighboring municipality told us that this practice has resulted in what he believes to be a widespread belief that those who attend court but cannot pay will be immediately arrested—a view that municipal judge says is “entirely the municipal courts’ fault” for perpetuating because they have not taken steps to correct it. Recent reports have documented other problematic practices. For example, a June 2014 letter from Presiding Circuit Court Judge Maura McShane to municipal court judges in the region discussed troubling and possibly unlawful practices of municipal courts in St. Louis County that served to prevent the public from attending court sessions. These practices included not allowing children in court. Indeed, as late as October 2014, the municipal court website in the neighboring municipality of Bel Ridge—where Judge Brockmeyer serves as prosecutor—stated that children are not allowed in court. While it appears that Ferguson’s court has always allowed children, we talked with people who assumed it did not because of their experiences in other courts. One man told us he was aggressively questioned by FPD officers after he left his child outside court with a friend because of this assumption. Thus, even though Ferguson might not engage in some of these practices, and while it may even be the case that other municipalities have themselves implemented reforms, the long history of these practices continues to shape community members’ views of what might happen to them if they attend court.
Court officials have told us that Ferguson’s expansive list of “must appear” offenses is not driven by any public safety need. That is underscored by the fact that, in some cases, attorneys are allowed to resolve such offenses over the phone without making any appearance in
26 The email reports that the defendant, a black male, was booked into jail. This email does not provide the full context of the circumstances that led to the 10-day jail sentence and further information is required to assess the appropriateness of that order. Nonetheless, the email suggests that the court jailed a defendant for refusing to answer questions, which raises significant Fifth Amendment concerns. There is also no indication as to whether the defendant was represented or, if not, was allowed or afforded representation to defend against the contempt charge and 10-day sentence.
50
court. Nonetheless, despite the acknowledged obstacles to appearing in person in court and the lack of any articulated need to appear in court in all but a few instances, Ferguson has taken few, if any, steps to reduce the number of cases that require a court appearance.
c. Driver’s License Suspensions Mandated by State Law and Unnecessarily Prolonged by Ferguson Make It Difficult to Resolve a Case and Impose Substantial Hardship
For many who have already had a warrant issued against them for failing to either appear or make a required payment, appearing in court is made especially difficult by the fact that their warrants likely resulted in the suspension of their driver’s licenses. Pursuant to Missouri state law, anyone who fails to pay a traffic citation for a moving violation on time, or who fails to appear in court regarding a moving traffic violation, has his or her driver’s license suspended. Mo. Rev. Stat. § 302.341.1. Thus, by virtue of having their licenses suspended, those who have already missed a required court appearance are more likely to fail to meet subsequent court obligations if they require physically appearing in court—fostering a cycle of missed appearances that is difficult to end. That is particularly so given what some City officials from Ferguson and surrounding communities have called substandard public transportation options. We spoke with one woman who had her license suspended because she received a Failure to Appear charge in Ferguson and so had to rely on a friend to drive her to court. When her friend canceled, she had no other means of getting to court on time, missed court, and had another Failure to Appear charge and arrest warrant issued against her—adding to the charges that required resolution before her license could be reinstated.27
To be clear, responsibility for the hardship imposed by automatically suspending a person’s license for failing to appear in a traffic case rests largely with this state law. Notably, however, Ferguson’s own discretionary practices amplify and prolong that law’s impact. A temporary suspension can be lifted with a compliance letter from the municipal court, but the Ferguson municipal court does not issue compliance letters unless a person has satisfied the entire fine pending on the charge that caused the suspension. This rule is not mandated by state law, which instead provides a municipality with the authority to decide when to issue a compliance letter. See Mo. Rev. Stat. § 302.341.1 (“Such suspension shall remain in effect until the court with the subject pending charge requests setting aside the noncompliance suspension pending final disposition.”). Indeed, Ferguson court staff told us that they will issue compliance letters before full payment has been made for cases that they determine, in their unguided discretion, to be sympathetic.
This rule and the Ferguson practices that magnify its impact underscore how missed court appearances can have broad ramifications for individuals’ ability to maintain a job and care for their families. We spoke with one woman who received three citations during a single incident in 2013 in which she pulled to the side of the road to allow a police car to pass, was confronted by the officer for doing so, and was cited for obstructing traffic, failing to signal, and not wearing a seatbelt. The woman appeared in court to challenge those citations, was told a new trial date would be mailed to her, and instead received notice from the Missouri Department of Revenue
27 While Missouri provides a process to secure a temporary waiver of a license suspension, we have heard from many that this process can be difficult and, in any case, is only available in certain circumstances.
51
several months later that her license was suspended. Upon informing the Court Clerk that she never received notice of her court date, the Clerk told her the trial date had passed two weeks earlier and that there was now a warrant for her arrest pending.28 Given that the woman’s license was suspended only two weeks after her trial date, it appears the court did not send a warning letter before entering a warrant and suspending the license, contrary to purported policy. Court records likewise do not indicate a letter being sent. The woman asked to see the Municipal Judge to explain the situation, but court staff informed her that she could only see the Judge if she was issued a new court date and that she would only be issued a new court date if she paid her $200 bond. With no opportunity to further petition the court, she wrote to Mayor Knowles about her situation, stating:
Although I feel I have been harassed, wronged and unjustly done by Ferguson . . . hat I am upset and concerned about is my driver’s license being suspended. I was told that I may not be able to  reinstate until the tickets are taken care of. I am a hard working mother of two children and I cannot by any means take care of my family or work with my license being suspended and being unable to drive. I have to have  valid license to keep my job because I transport clients that I work with not to mention I drive my children back and forth to school, practices and rehearsals on a daily basis. I am writing this letter because no one has been able to help me and I am really hoping that I can get some help getting this issue resolved expediently.
It appears that, at the Mayor’s request, the court entered “Not Guilty” dispositions on her cases, several months after they first resulted in the license suspension.
d. Court Operations Impose Obstacles to Resolving Even Those Offenses that Do Not Require In-Person Court Appearance
The limited number of code violations that do not require an in-person court appearance can likewise be difficult to resolve, even if a person can afford to do so. The court has accepted mailed payments for some time and has recently begun to accept online payments, but the court’s website suggests that in-person payment is required and provides no information that payment online or by mail is an option. As a result, many people try to remit payment to the court window within the police department. But community members have informed us that the court window often closes earlier than the posted hours indicate. Indeed, during our investigation, we observed the court window close at 4:30 p.m. on days where an evening court session was not being held, despite the fact that both the Ferguson City website and the Missouri Courts website state that the window closes at 5:00 p.m.29 On one such occasion, we observed two different sets
28 By initiating the license suspension procedure after a single missed appearance and without first providing notice or an opportunity to remedy the missed appearance, the court appears to have violated Missouri law. See Mo. Rev. Stat. § 302.341.1 (providing that after a missed appearance associated with a moving violation, a court “shall within ten days . . . inform the defendant by ordinary mail at the last address shown on the court records that the court will order the director of revenue to suspend the defendant’s driving privileges if the charges are not disposed of and fully paid within thirty days from the date of mailing”).

of people arrive after 4:30 p.m. but before 5:00 p.m. One man told us his ticket payment was due that day. Another woman arrived in the rain with her small child, unsuccessfully attempted to call someone to the window, and left. Even when the court window is technically open, we have seen people standing at the window waiting for a response to their knocks for long periods of time, sometimes in inclement weather—even as court staff sat inside the police department tending to their normal duties.
As noted above, documents we reviewed showed that even where individuals are successful in talking with court staff about a citation, FPD-issued citations are sometimes so deficient that court staff are unable to determine what the fine, or even charge, is supposed to be. Evidence also shows that court staff have at times been unable to even find a person’s case file, often because the FPD officer who issued the ticket failed to properly file a copy. In these cases, a person is left unable to resolve her or his citation.
e. High Fines, Coupled with Legally Inadequate Ability-to-Pay Determinations and Insufficient Alternatives to Immediate Payment, Impose a Significant Burden on People Living In or Near Poverty
It is common for a single traffic stop or other encounter with FPD to give rise to fines in amounts that a person living in poverty is unable to immediately pay. This fact is attributable in part to FPD’s practice of issuing multiple citations—frequently three or more—on a single stop. This fact is also attributable to the fine assessment practices of the Ferguson municipal court, including not only the high fine amounts imposed, but also the inadequate process available for those who cannot afford to pay a fine. Even setting aside cases where additional fines and fees were imposed for Failure to Appear violations, our investigation found instances in which the court charged $302 for a single Manner of Walking violation; $427 for a single Peace Disturbance violation; $531 for High Grass and Weeds; $777 for Resisting Arrest; and $792 for Failure to Obey, and $527 for Failure to Comply, which officers appear to use interchangeably.
For many, the hardship of the fine amounts imposed is exacerbated by the fact that they owe similar fines in other, neighboring municipalities. We spoke with one woman who, in addition to owing several hundred dollars in fines to Ferguson, also owed fines to the municipal courts in Jennings and Edmundson. In total, she owed over $2,500 in fines and fees, even after already making over $1,000 in payments and clearing cases in several other municipalities. This woman’s case is not unique. We have heard reports from many individuals and even City officials that, in light of the large number of municipalities in the area immediately surrounding Ferguson, most of which have their own police departments and municipal courts, it is common for people to face significant fines from many municipalities.
City officials have extolled that the Ferguson preset fine schedule establishes fines that are “at or near the top of the list” compared with other municipalities across a large number of offenses. A more recent comparison of the preset fines of roughly 70 municipal courts in the region confirms that Ferguson’s fine amounts are above regional averages for many offenses, particularly discretionary offenses such as non-speeding-related traffic offenses. That comparison also shows that Ferguson imposes the highest fine of any of those roughly 70 municipalities for the offense of Failing to Provide Proof of Insurance; Ferguson charges $375, whereas the average fine imposed is $186 and the median fine imposed is $175. In 2013 alone,
53
the Ferguson court collected over $286,000 in fines for that offense—more than any other offense except Failure to Appear.
The fines that the court imposes for offenses without preset fines are more difficult to evaluate precisely because they are imposed on a case-by-case basis. Typically, however, in imposing fines for non-TVB offenses during court sessions, the Municipal Judge adopts the fine recommendations of the Prosecuting Attorney—who also serves as the Ferguson City Attorney. As discussed above, court staff have communicated with the Municipal Judge regarding the need to ensure that the prosecutor’s recommended fines are sufficiently high because “e need to keep up our revenue.” We were also told of at least one incident in which an attorney received a fine recommendation from the prosecutor for his client, but when the client went to court to pay the fine, a clerk refused payment, informing her that there was an additional $100 owed beyond the fine recommended by the prosecutor.
The court imposes these fines without providing any process by which a person can seek a fine reduction on account of financial incapacity. The court does not provide any opportunity for a person unable to pay a preset TVB fine to seek a modification of the fine amount. Nor does the court consider a person’s financial ability to pay in determining how much of a fine to impose in cases without preset fines. The Ferguson court’s failure to assess a defendant’s ability to pay stands in direct tension with Missouri law, which instructs that in determining the amount and the method of payment of a fine, a court “shall, insofar as practicable, proportion the fine to the burden that payment will impose in view of the financial resources of an individual.” Mo. Rev. Stat. § 560.026.
In lieu of proportioning a fine to a particular individual’s ability to pay or allowing a process by which a person could petition the court for a reduction, the court offers payment plans to those who cannot afford to immediately pay in full. But such payment plans do not serve as a substitute for an ability-to-pay determination, which, properly employed, can enable a person in some cases to pay in full and resolve the case. Moreover, the court’s rules regarding payment plans are themselves severe. Unlike some other municipalities that require a $50 monthly payment, Ferguson’s standard payment plan requires payments of $100 per month, which remains a difficult amount for many to pay, especially those who are also making payments to other municipalities. Further, the court treats a single missed, partial, or untimely payment as a missed appearance. In such a case, the court immediately issues an arrest warrant without any notice or opportunity to explain why a payment was missed—for example, because the person was sick, or the court closed its doors early that day. The court reportedly has softened this rule during the course of our investigation by allowing a person who has missed a payment to go to court to seek leave for not paying the full amount owed. However, even this softened rule provides minimal relief, as making this request requires a person to appear in court the first Wednesday of the month at 11:00 a.m. If a person misses that session, the court immediately issues an arrest warrant.
Before the court provided this Wednesday morning court session for those on payment plans, court staff frequently rejected requests from payment plan participants to reduce or continue monthly payments—leaving individuals unable to make the required payment with no recourse besides incurring a Failure to Appear charge, receiving additional fines, and having an arrest warrant issued. In July 2014, an assistant court clerk wrote in an email that she rejected a defendant’s request for a reduced monthly payment on account of inability to pay and told the
54
defendant, “everyone says  can’t pay.” This is consistent with earlier noted statements by the acting Ferguson prosecutor that he stopped granting “needless requests for continuances from the payment docket.” Another defendant who owed $1,002 in fines and fees stemming from a Driving with a Revoked License charge wrote to a City official that he would be unable to make his required monthly payment but hoped to avoid having a warrant issued. He explained that he was unemployed, that the court had put him on a payment plan only a week before his first payment was due, and that he did not have enough time to gather enough money. He implored the City to provide “some kind of community service to work off the fines/fees,” stating that “I want to pay you guys what I owe” and “I have been trying to scrape up what I can,” but that “with warrants it’s hard to get a job.” The City official forwarded the request to a court clerk, who noted that the underlying charge dated back to 2007, that five Failure to Appear charges had been levied, and that no payments had yet been made. The clerk responded: “In this certain case  will go to warrant.” Records show that, only a week earlier, this same clerk asked a court clerk from another municipality to clear a ticket for former Ferguson Police Chief Moonier as a “courtesy.” And, only a month later, that same clerk also helped the Ferguson Collector of Revenue clear two citations issued by neighboring municipalities.
Ferguson does not typically offer community service as an alternative to fines. City officials have emphasized to us that Ferguson is one of only a few municipalities in the region to provide any form of a community service program, and that the program that is available is well run. But the program, which began in February 2014, is only available on a limited basis, mostly to certain defendants who are 19 years old or younger.30 We have heard directly from individuals who could not afford to pay their fines—and thus accumulated additional charges and fines and had warrants issued against them—that they requested a community service alternative to monetary payment but were told no such alternative existed. One man who still owes $1,100 stemming from a speeding and seatbelt violation from 2000 told us that he has been arrested repeatedly in connection with the fines he cannot afford to pay, and that “no one is willing to work with him to find an alternative solution.” City officials have recognized the need to provide a meaningful community service option. In August 2013, one City Councilmember wrote to the City Manager and the Mayor that, “or a few years now we have talked about offering community service to those who can’t afford to pay their fines, but we haven’t actually made it happen.” The Councilmember noted the benefits of such a program, including that it would “keep those people that simply don’t have the money to pay their fines from constantly being arrested and going to jail, only to be released and do it all over again.”
2. The Court Imposes Unduly Harsh Penalties for Missed Payments or Appearances
The procedural deficiencies identified above work together to make it exceedingly difficult to resolve a case and exceedingly easy to run afoul of the court’s stringent and confusing rules, particularly for those living in or near poverty. That the court is at least in part responsible for causing cases to protract and result in technical violations has not prevented it from imposing
30 Recently, the court has allowed some individuals over age 19 to resolve fines through community service, but that remains a rarity. See City of Ferguson Continues Court Reform Initiative by Offering Community Service Program, City of Ferguson (Dec. 15, 2014), http://www.fergusoncity.com/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=370&ARC=699 (stating community service program was launched in partnership with Ferguson Youth Initiative in February 2014 “to assist teenagers and certain other defendants”).
55
significant penalties when those violations occur. Although Ferguson’s court—unlike many other municipal courts in the region—has ceased imposing the Failure to Appear charge, the court continues to routinely issue arrest warrants for missed appearances and missed payments. The evidence we have found shows that these arrest warrants are used almost exclusively for the purpose of compelling payment through the threat of incarceration. The evidence also shows that the harms of the court’s warrant practices are exacerbated by the court’s bond procedures, which impose unnecessary obstacles to clearing a warrant or securing release after being arrested on a warrant and often function to further prolong a case and a person’s involvement in the municipal justice system. These practices—together with the consequences to individuals and communities that result—raise significant due process and equal protection concerns.
a. The Ferguson Municipal Court Uses Arrest Warrants Primarily as a Means of Securing Payment
Ferguson uses its police department in large part as a collection agency for its municipal court. Ferguson’s municipal court issues arrest warrants at a rate that police officials have called, in internal emails, “staggering.” According to the court’s own figures, as of December 2014, over 16,000 people had outstanding arrest warrants that had been issued by the court. In fiscal year 2013 alone, the court issued warrants to approximately 9,007 people. Many of those individuals had warrants issued on multiple charges, as the 9,007 warrants applied to 32,975 different offenses.
In the wake of several news accounts indicating that the Ferguson municipal court issued over 32,000 warrants in fiscal year 2013, court staff determined that it had mistakenly reported to the state of Missouri the number of charged offenses that had warrants (32,975), not the number of people who had warrants outstanding (9,007). Our investigation indicates that is the case. In any event, it is probative of FPD’s enforcement practices that those roughly 9,000 warrants were issued for over 32,000 offenses. Moreover, for those against whom a warrant is issued, the number of offenses included within the warrant has tremendous practical importance. As discussed below, the bond amount a person must pay to clear a warrant before an arrest occurs, or to secure release once a warrant has been executed, is often dependent on the number of offenses to which the warrant applies. And, that the court issued warrants for the arrest of roughly 9,000 people is itself not insignificant; even under that calculation, Ferguson has one of the highest warrant totals in the region.
The large number of warrants issued by the court, by any count, is due exclusively to the fact that the court uses arrest warrants and the threat of arrest as its primary tool for collecting outstanding fines for municipal code violations. With extremely limited exceptions, every warrant issued by the Ferguson municipal court was issued because: 1) a person missed consecutive court appearances, or 2) a person missed a single required fine payment as part of a payment plan. Under current court policy, the court issues a warrant in every case where either of those circumstances arises—regardless of the severity of the code violation that the case involves. Indeed, the court rarely issues a warrant for any other purpose. FPD does not request arrest or any other kind of warrants from the Ferguson municipal court; in fact, FPD officers told us that they have been instructed not to file warrant applications with the municipal court because the court does not have the capacity to consider them.
56
While issuing municipal warrants against people who have not appeared or paid their municipal code violation fines is sometimes framed as addressing the failure to abide by court rules, in practice, it is clear that warrants are primarily issued to coerce payment.31 One municipal judge from a neighboring municipality told us that the use of the Failure to Appear charge “provides cushion for judges against the attack that the court is operating as a debtor’s prison.” And the Municipal Judge in Ferguson has acknowledged repeatedly that the warrants the court issues are not put in place for public safety purposes. Indeed, once a warrant issues, there is no urgency within FPD to actually execute it. Court staff reported that they typically take weeks, if not months, to enter warrants into the system that enables patrol officers to determine if a person they encounter has an outstanding warrant. As of December 2014, for example, some warrants issued in September 2014 were not yet detectable to officers in the field. Court staff also informed us that no one from FPD has ever commented on that lag or prioritized closing it. Nor does there seem to be any public safety obstacle to eliminating failure to appear warrants altogether. The court has, in fact, adopted a temporary “warrant recall program” that allows individuals who show up to court to immediately have their warrants recalled and a new court date assigned. And, under longstanding practice, once an attorney makes an appearance in a case, the court automatically discharges any pending warrants.
That the primary role of warrants is not to protect public safety but rather to facilitate fine collection is further evidenced by the fact that the warrants issued by the court are overwhelmingly issued in non-criminal traffic cases that would not themselves result in a penalty of imprisonment. From 2010 to December 2014, the offenses (besides Failure to Appear ordinance violations) that most often led to a municipal warrant were: Driving While License Is Suspended, Expired License Plates, Failure to Register a Vehicle, No Proof of Insurance, and Speed Limit violations. These offenses comprised the majority of offenses that led to a warrant not because they are more severe than other offenses, but rather because every missed appearance or payment on any charge results in a warrant, and these were some of the most common charges brought by FPD during that period.
Even though these underlying code violations would not on their own result in a penalty of imprisonment, arrest and detention are not uncommon once a warrant enters on a case. We have found that FPD officers frequently check individuals for warrants, even when the person is not reasonably suspected of engaging in any criminal activity, and, if a municipal warrant exists, will often make an arrest. City officials have told us that the decision to arrest a person for an outstanding warrant is “highly discretionary” and that officers will frequently not arrest unless the person is “ignorant.” Records show, however, that officers do arrest individuals for outstanding municipal warrants with considerable frequency. Jail records are poorly managed, and data on jail bookings is only available as of April 2014. But during the roughly six-month period from April to September 2014, 256 people were booked into the Ferguson City Jail after being arrested at least in part for an outstanding warrant—96% of whom were African American. Of these individuals, 28 were held for longer than two days, and 27 of these 28 people were black.
31 As stated in the Missouri Municipal Court Handbook produced by the Circuit Court: “Defendants who fail or refuse to pay their fines and costs can be extremely difficult to deal with, but if there is a credible threat of incarceration if they do not pay, the job of collection becomes much easier.” Mo. Mun. Benchbook, Cir. Ct., Mun. Divs. § 13.6 (2010).
57
Similarly, data collected during vehicle stops shows that, during a larger period of time between October 2012 and October 2014, FPD arrested roughly 460 individuals following a vehicle stop solely because they had outstanding warrants. This figure is likely a significant underrepresentation of the total number of people arrested for outstanding warrants during that period, as it does not include those people arrested on outstanding warrants not during traffic stops; nor does it include those people arrested during traffic stops for multiple reasons, but who might not have been stopped, much less arrested, without the officer performing a warrant check on the car and finding an outstanding warrant. Even among this limited pool, the data shows the disparate impact these arrests have on African Americans. Of the 460 individuals arrested during traffic stops solely for outstanding warrants, 443 individuals—or 96%—were African American.
That data also does not include those people arrested by other municipal police departments on the basis of an outstanding warrant issued by Ferguson. As has been widely reported in recent months, many municipal police departments in the region identify people with warrants pending in other towns and then arrest and hold those individuals on behalf of those towns. FPD’s records show that it routinely arrests individuals on warrants issued by other jurisdictions. And, although we did not review the records of other departments, we have heard reports of many individuals who were arrested for a Ferguson-issued warrant by police officers outside of Ferguson. On some occasions, Ferguson will decline to pick up a person arrested in a different municipality for a Ferguson warrant and, after however long it takes for that decision to be made, the person will be released, sometimes after being required to pay bond. On other occasions, Ferguson will send an officer to retrieve the person for incarceration in the Ferguson City Jail; FPD supervisors have in fact instructed officers to do so “regardless of the charge or the bond amount, or the number of prisoners we have in custody.” We found evidence of FPD officers traveling more than 200 miles to retrieve a person detained by another agency on a Ferguson municipal warrant.
Because of the large number of municipalities in the region, many of which have warrant practices similar to Ferguson, it is not unusual for a person to be arrested by one department, have outstanding warrants pending in other police departments, and be handed off from one department to another until all warrants are cleared. We have heard of individuals who have run out of money during this process—referred to by many as the “muni shuffle”—and as a result were detained for a week or longer.
The large number of municipal court warrants being issued, many of which lead to arrest, raises significant due process and equal protection concerns. In particular, Ferguson’s practice of automatically treating a missed payment as a failure to appear—thus triggering an arrest warrant and possible incarceration—is directly at odds with well-established law that prohibits “punishing a person for his poverty.” Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 671 (1983); see also Tate v. Short, 401 U.S. 395, 398 (1971). In Bearden, the Supreme Court found unconstitutional a state’s decision to revoke probation and sentence a defendant to prison because the defendant was unable to pay a required fine. Bearden, 461 U.S. at 672-73. The Court held that before imposing imprisonment, a court must first inquire as to whether the missed payment was attributable to an inability to pay and, if so, “consider alternate measures of punishment other than imprisonment.” Id. at 672; see also Martin v. Solem, 801 F.2d 324, 332 (8th Cir. 1986)
58
(noting that the state court had failed to adequately determine, as required by Bearden, whether the defendant had “made sufficient bona fide efforts legally to acquire the resources to pay,” but nonetheless denying habeas relief because the defendant’s failure to pay was due not to indigency but his “willful refusal to pay”).
The Ferguson court, however, has in the past routinely issued arrest warrants when a person is unable to make a required fine payment without any ability-to-pay determination. While the court does not sentence a defendant to jail in such a case, the result is often equivalent to what Bearden proscribes: the incarceration of a defendant solely because of an inability to pay a fine. In response to concerns about issuing warrants in such cases, Ferguson officials have told us that without issuing warrants and threatening incarceration, they have no ability to secure payment. But the Supreme Court rejected that argument, finding that states are “not powerless to enforce judgments against those financially unable to pay a fine,” and noting that—especially in cases like those at issue here in which the court has already made a determination that penological interests do not demand incarceration—a court can “establish a reduced fine or alternate public service in lieu of a fine that adequately serves the state’s goals of punishment and deterrence, given the defendant’s diminished financial resources.”32 Id. As discussed above, however, Ferguson has not established any such alternative.33
Finally, in light of the significant portion of municipal charges that lead to an arrest warrant, as well as the substantial number of arrest warrants that lead to arrest and detention, we have considerable concerns regarding whether individuals facing charges in Ferguson municipal court are entitled to, and being unlawfully denied, the right to counsel.
b. Ferguson’s Bond Practices Impose Undue Hardship on Those Seeking to Secure Release from the Ferguson City Jail
Our investigation found substantial deficiencies in the way Ferguson police and court officials set, accept, refund, and forfeit bond payments. Recently, in response to concerns raised during our investigation, the City implemented several changes to its bond practices, most of which apply to those detained after a warrantless arrest.34 These changes represent positive
32 Ferguson officials have also told us that the arrest warrant is issued not because of the missed payment per se, but rather because the person missing the payment failed to abide by the court’s rules. But the Supreme Court has rejected that contention, too. In Bearden, the Court noted that the sentencing court’s stated concern “was that the petitioner had disobeyed a prior court order to pay the fine,” but found that the sentence nonetheless “is no more than imprisoning a person solely because he lacks funds” to pay. Bearden, 461 U.S. at 674.
33 Additionally, Ferguson’s municipal code provides: “When a sentence for violation of any provision of this Code or other ordinance of the city . . . includes a fine and such fine is not paid, or if the costs of prosecution adjudged against an offender are not paid, the person under sentence shall be imprisoned one day for every ten dollars ($10.00) of any such unpaid fine or costs . . . not to exceed a total of four (4) months.” Ferguson Mun. Code § 1-16. Our investigation did not uncover any evidence that the court has sentenced anyone to imprisonment pursuant to this statute in the past several years. Nonetheless, it is concerning that this statute, which unconstitutionally sanctions imprisonment for failing to pay a fine, remains in effect. Cf. Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 671 (1983).
34 In December 2014, the court set forth a bond schedule for warrantless arrests, which provides that, for all but 14 code violations, a person arrested pursuant to a municipal code violation and brought to Ferguson City Jail shall be issued a citation or summons and released on his or her own recognizance without any bond payment required. For those 14 code violations requiring a bond, the court has set “fixed” bond amounts, although these are subject to the court’s discretion to raise or lower those amounts at the request of the City or the detained individual. The court’s
59
developments, but many deficiencies remain.35 Given the high number of arrest warrants issued by the municipal court—and given that in many cases a person can only clear a pending warrant or secure release from detention by posting bond—the deficiencies identified below impose significant harm to individuals in Ferguson.
Current bond practices are unclear and inconsistent. Information provided by the City reveals a haphazard bond system that results in people being erroneously arrested, and some people paying bond but not getting credit for having done so. Documents describe officers finding hundred dollar bills in their pockets that were given to them for bond payment and not remembering which jail detainee provided them; bond paperwork being found on the floor; and individuals being arrested after their bonds had been accepted because the corresponding warrants were never cancelled. At one point in 2012, Ferguson's Court Clerk called such issues a “daily problem.” The City’s practices for receiving and tracking bond payments have not changed appreciably since then.
The practices for setting bond are similarly erratic. The Municipal Judge advised us that he sets all bonds upon issuing an arrest warrant. We found, however, that bond amounts are mostly set by court staff, and are rarely even reviewed by the Judge. While court staff told us that the current bond schedule requires a bond of $200 for up to four traffic offenses, $100 for every traffic offense thereafter, $100 for every Failure to Appear charge, and $300 for every criminal offense, FPD’s own policy includes a bond schedule that departs from these figures. In practice, bond amounts vary widely. See FPD General Order 421.02. Our review of a random sample of warrants indicates that bond is set in a manner that often departs from both the schedule referenced by court staff and the schedule found in FPD policy. In a number of these cases, the bond amount far exceeded the amount of the underlying fine.
The court’s bond practices, including the fact that the court often imposes bonds that exceed the amount owed to the court, do not appear to be grounded in any public safety need. In a July 2014 email to Chief Jackson and other police officials, the Court Clerk reported that “tarting today we are going to reduce anyone’s bond that calls and is in warrant to half the amount,” explaining that “his may bring in some extra monies this way.” The email identifies no public safety obstacle or other reason not to implement the bond reduction. Notably, the email also states that “e will only do this between the hours of 8:30 to 4” and that no half-bond will be accepted after those hours unless the Court Clerk approves it.36 Thus, as a result of this policy, an individual able to appear at the court window during business hours would pay half as much to clear a warrant as an individual who is actually arrested on a warrant after hours. That Ferguson’s bond practices do not appear grounded in public safety is underscored by the
recent order further provides that, even if an individual does not pay the bond required, he or she shall in any case be released after 12 hours, rather than the previous 72-hour limit.
35 For example, the recent orders fail to specify that, in considering whether to adjust the bond imposed, the court shall make an assessment of an individual’s ability to pay, and assign bond proportionately. Cf. Pugh v. Rainwater, 572 F.2d 1053, 1057 (5th Cir. 1978) (en banc) (noting that the incarceration of those who cannot afford to meet the requirements of a fixed bond schedule “without meaningful consideration of other possible alternatives” infringes on due process and equal protection requirements).
36 The court’s website states that the court window is open from 8:30 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., not 4:00 p.m. See City Courts, City of Ferguson, http://www.fergusoncity.com/60/The-City-Of-Ferguson-Municipal-Courts (last visited Feb. 26, 2015).
60
fact that the court will typically cancel outstanding warrants without requiring the posting of any bond for people who have an attorney enter an appearance on their behalf. Records show that this practice is also applied haphazardly, and there do not appear to be any rules that govern the apparent discretion court staff have to waive or require bond following an attorney’s appearance.
It is not uncommon for an individual charged with only a minor violation to be arrested on a warrant, be unable to afford bond, and have no recourse but to await release. Longstanding court rules provide for a person arrested pursuant to an arrest warrant to be held up to 72 hours before being released without bond, and the court’s recent orders do not appear to change this. Records show that individuals are routinely held for 72 hours. FPD’s records management system only began capturing meaningful jail data in April 2014; but from April to September 2014 alone, 77 people were detained in the jail for longer than two days, and many of those detentions neared, reached, or exceeded the 72-hour mark. Of those 77 people, 73, or 95%, were black. Many people, including the woman described earlier who was charged with two parking code violations, have reported being held up until the 72-hour limit—despite having no ability to pay.
Indeed, many others report being held for far longer, and documentary evidence is consistent with these reports. In April 2010, for example, the Chief of Police wrote an email to the Captain of the Patrol Division stating that the “intent is that when the watch commander / street supervisor gets the census from the jail he asks who will come up on 72 hrs.,” and, if there is any such person, “he can have them given the next available court date and released, or authorize they remain in jail, since he will be the designate.” The email continues: “If someone has already been there more than 72 hours, it may be assumed their continued hold was previously authorized.” Further, as noted above, while comprehensive jail records do not exist for detentions prior to April 2014, records do show several recent instances in which FPD detained a person for longer than the purported 72-hour limit.
Despite the fact that those arrested by FPD for outstanding municipal warrants can be held for several days if unable to post bond, the Ferguson municipal court does not give credit for time served. As a result, there have been many cases in which a person has been arrested on a warrant, detained for 72 hours or more, and released owing the same amount as before the arrest was made. Court records do not even track the total amount of time a person has spent in jail as part of a case. When asked why this is not tracked, a member of court staff told us: “It’s only three days anyway.”
These prolonged detentions for those who cannot afford bond are alarming, and raise considerable due process and equal protection concerns. The prolonged detentions are especially concerning given that there is no public safety need for those who receive municipal warrants to be jailed at all. The Ferguson Municipal Judge has acknowledged that for most code violations, it is “probably a good idea to do away with jail time.”
Further, there are many circumstances in which court practices preclude a person from making payment against the underlying fine owed—and thus resolving the case, or at least moving the case toward resolution—and instead force the person to pay a bond. If, for example, an individual is jailed on a “must appear” charge and has not yet appeared in court to have the
61
fine assessed, the individual will not be allowed to make payment on the underlying charge. Rather, the person must post bond, receive a new court date, appear in court, and start the process anew. Even when the underlying fine has been assessed, a person in jail may still be forced to make a bond payment instead of a fine payment to secure release if court staff are unavailable to determine the amount the person owes. And when a person attempts to resolve a warrant before they end up arrested, a bond payment will typically be required unless the person can afford to pay the underlying fine in full, as, by purported policy, the court does not accept partial payment of fines outside of a court-sanctioned payment plan.
Bond forfeiture procedures also raise significant due process concerns. Under current practice, the first missed appearance or missed payment following a bond payment results in a warning letter being sent; after the second missed appearance or payment, the court initiates a forfeiture action (and issues another arrest warrant). As with “warrant warning letters” described above, our investigation has been unable to verify that the court consistently sends bond forfeiture warning letters. And, as with warrant warning letters, bond forfeiture warning letters are sometimes returned to the court, but court staff members do not appear to make any further attempt to contact the intended recipient.
Upon a bond being forfeited, the court directs the bond money into the City’s account and does not apply the amount to the individual’s underlying fine. For example, if a person owes a $200 fine payment, is arrested on a warrant, and posts a bond of $200, the forfeiture of the bond will result in the fine remaining $200 and an arrest warrant being issued. If, instead, Ferguson were to allow this $200 to go toward the underlying fine, this would resolve the matter entirely, obviating the need for any warrant or subsequent court appearance. Not applying a forfeited bond to the underlying fine is especially troubling considering that this policy does not appear to be clearly communicated to those paying bonds. Particularly in cases where the bond is set at an amount near the underlying fine owed—which we have found to be common—it is entirely plausible that a person paying bond would mistakenly believe that payment resolves the case.
When asked why the forfeited bond is not applied to the underlying fine, court staff asserted that applicable law prohibits them from doing so without the bond payer’s consent.37 That explanation is grounded in an incorrect view of the law. In Perry v. Aversman, 168 S.W.3d 541 (Mo. Ct. App. 2005), the Missouri Court of Appeals explicitly upheld a rule requiring that forfeited bonds be applied to pending fines of the person who paid bond and found that such practices are acceptable so long as the court provides sufficient notice. Id. at 543-46. In light of the fact that applicable law permits forfeited bonds to be applied to pending fines, Ferguson’s longstanding practice of directing forfeited bond money to the City’s general fund is troubling. In fiscal year 2013 alone, the City collected forfeited bond amounts of $177,168, which could instead have been applied to the fines of those making the payments.
Ferguson’s rules and procedures for refunding bond payments upon satisfaction of the underlying fine raise similar concerns. Ferguson requires that when a person pays the underlying
37 Critically, however, when a person attends court after paying a bond and is assessed a fine, court staff members do automatically apply the bond already paid to the fine owed, and in fact require application of the bond to the fine regardless of the defendant’s wishes. Thus, the court has simultaneously asserted that it can apply a bond to a fine without a defendant’s consent when the bond would otherwise be returned to the defendant, but that it cannot apply a bond to a fine without a defendant’s consent when the bond would otherwise be forfeited into the City’s own accounts.
62
fine to avoid bond forfeiture, he or she must pay in person and provide photo identification. Yet, where the underlying fine is less than the bond amount—a common occurrence—the City does not immediately refund the difference to the individual. Rather, pursuant to a directive issued by the current City Finance Director approximately four years ago, bond refunds cannot be made in person, and instead must be sent via mail. According to Ferguson’s Court Clerk, it is not entirely uncommon for these refund checks to be returned as undeliverable and become “unclaimed property.”
C. Ferguson Law Enforcement Practices Disproportionately Harm Ferguson’s African-American Residents and Are Driven in Part by Racial Bias
Ferguson’s police and municipal court practices disproportionately harm African Americans. Further, our investigation found substantial evidence that this harm stems in part from intentional discrimination in violation of the Constitution.
African Americans experience disparate impact in nearly every aspect of Ferguson’s law enforcement system. Despite making up 67% of the population, African Americans accounted for 85% of FPD’s traffic stops, 90% of FPD’s citations, and 93% of FPD’s arrests from 2012 to 2014. Other statistical disparities, set forth in detail below, show that in Ferguson:
 African Americans are 2.07 times more likely to be searched during a vehicular stop but are 26% less likely to have contraband found on them during a search. They are 2.00 times more likely to receive a citation and 2.37 times more likely to be arrested following a vehicular stop.
 African Americans have force used against them at disproportionately high rates, accounting for 88% of all cases from 2010 to August 2014 in which an FPD officer reported using force. In all 14 uses of force involving a canine bite for which we have information about the race of the person bitten, the person was African American.
 African Americans are more likely to receive multiple citations during a single incident, receiving four or more citations on 73 occasions between October 2012 and July 2014, whereas non-African Americans received four or more citations only twice during that period.
 African Americans account for 95% of Manner of Walking charges; 94% of all Fail to Comply charges; 92% of all Resisting Arrest charges; 92% of all Peace Disturbance charges; and 89% of all Failure to Obey charges.38
 African Americans are 68% less likely than others to have their cases dismissed by the Municipal Judge, and in 2013 African Americans accounted for 92% of cases in which an arrest warrant was issued.
38 As noted above, FPD charges violations of Municipal Code Section 29-16 as both Failure to Obey and Failure to Comply. Court data carries forward this inconsistency.
63
 African Americans account for 96% of known arrests made exclusively because of an outstanding municipal warrant.
These disparities are not the necessary or unavoidable results of legitimate public safety efforts. In fact, the practices that lead to these disparities in many ways undermine law enforcement effectiveness. See, e.g., Jack Glaser, Suspect Race: Causes and Consequence of Racial Profiling 96-126 (2015) (because profiling can increase crime while harming communities, it has a “high risk” of contravening the core police objectives of controlling crime and promoting public safety). The disparate impact of these practices thus violates federal law, including Title VI and the Safe Streets Act.
The racially disparate impact of Ferguson’s practices is driven, at least in part, by intentional discrimination in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Racial bias and stereotyping is evident from the facts, taken together. This evidence includes: the consistency and magnitude of the racial disparities throughout Ferguson’s police and court enforcement actions; the selection and execution of police and court practices that disproportionately harm African Americans and do little to promote public safety; the persistent exercise of discretion to the detriment of African Americans; the apparent consideration of race in assessing threat; and the historical opposition to having African Americans live in Ferguson, which lingers among some today. We have also found explicit racial bias in the communications of police and court supervisors and that some officials apply racial stereotypes, rather than facts, to explain the harm African Americans experience due to Ferguson’s approach to law enforcement. “Determining whether invidious discriminatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available.” Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266 (1977). Based on this evidence as a whole, we have found that Ferguson’s law enforcement activities stem in part from a discriminatory purpose and thus deny African Americans equal protection of the laws in violation of the Constitution.
1. Ferguson’s Law Enforcement Actions Impose a Disparate Impact on African Americans that Violates Federal Law
African Americans are disproportionately represented at nearly every stage of Ferguson law enforcement, from initial police contact to final disposition of a case in municipal court. While FPD’s data collection and retention practices are deficient in many respects, the data that is collected by FPD is sufficient to allow for meaningful and reliable analysis of racial disparities. This data—collected directly by police and court officials—reveals racial disparities that are substantial and consistent across a wide range of police and court enforcement actions.
African Americans experience the harms of the disparities identified below as part of a comprehensive municipal justice system that, at each juncture, enforces the law more harshly against black people than others. The disparate impact of Ferguson’s enforcement actions is compounding: at each point in the enforcement process there is a higher likelihood that an African American will be subjected to harsher treatment; accordingly, as the adverse consequences imposed by Ferguson grow more and more severe, those consequences are imposed more and more disproportionately against African Americans. Thus, while 85% of
64
FPD’s vehicle stops are of African Americans, 90% of FPD’s citations are issued to African Americans, and 92% of all warrants are issued in cases against African Americans. Strikingly, available data shows that of those subjected to one of the most severe actions this system routinely imposes—actual arrest for an outstanding municipal warrant—96% are African American.
a. Disparate Impact of FPD Practices
i. Disparate Impact of FPD Enforcement Actions Arising from Vehicular Stops
Pursuant to Missouri state law on racial profiling, Mo. Rev. Stat. § 590.650, FPD officers are required to collect race and other data during every traffic stop. While some law enforcement agencies collect more comprehensive data to identify and stem racial profiling, this information is sufficient to show that FPD practices exert a racially disparate impact along several dimensions.
FPD reported 11,610 vehicle stops between October 2012 and October 2014. African Americans accounted for 85%, or 9,875, of those stops, despite making up only 67% of the population. White individuals made up 15%, or 1,735, of stops during that period, despite representing 29% of the population. These differences indicate that FPD traffic stop practices may disparately impact black drivers.39 Even setting aside the question of whether there are racial disparities in FPD’s traffic stop practices, however, the data collected during those stops reliably shows statistically significant racial disparities in the outcomes people receive after being stopped. Unlike with vehicle stops, assessing the disparate impact of post-stop outcomes—such as the rate at which stops result in citations, searches, or arrests—is not dependent on population data or on assumptions about differential offending rates by race; instead, the enforcement actions imposed against stopped black drivers are compared directly to the enforcement actions imposed against stopped white drivers.
In Ferguson, traffic stops of black drivers are more likely to lead to searches, citations, and arrests than are stops of white drivers. Black people are significantly more likely to be searched during a traffic stop than white people. From October 2012 to October 2014, 11% of stopped black drivers were searched, whereas only 5% of stopped white drivers were searched.
39 While there are limitations to using basic population data as a benchmark when evaluating whether there are racial disparities in vehicle stops, it is sufficiently reliable here. In fact, in Ferguson, black drivers might account for less of the driving pool than would be expected from overall population rates because a lower proportion of blacks than whites is at or above the minimum driving age. See 2009-2013 5-Year American Community Survey, U.S. Census Bureau (2015) (showing higher proportion of black population in under-15 and under-19 age categories than white population). Ferguson officials have told us that they believe that black drivers account for more of the driving pool than their 67% share of the population because the driving pool also includes drivers traveling from neighboring municipalities—many of which have higher black populations than Ferguson. Our investigation casts doubt upon that claim. An analysis of zip-code data from the 53,850 summonses FPD issued from January 1, 2009 to October 14, 2014, shows that the African-American makeup for all zip codes receiving a summons—weighted by population size and the number of summonses received by people from that zip code—is 63%. Thus, there is substantial reason to believe that the share of drivers in Ferguson who are black is in fact lower than population data suggests.
65
Despite being searched at higher rates, African Americans are 26% less likely to have contraband found on them than whites: 24% of searches of African Americans resulted in a contraband finding, whereas 30% of searches of whites resulted in a contraband finding. This disparity exists even after controlling for the type of search conducted, whether a search incident to arrest, a consent search, or a search predicated on reasonable suspicion. The lower rate at which officers find contraband when searching African Americans indicates either that officers’ suspicion of criminal wrongdoing is less likely to be accurate when interacting with African Americans or that officers are more likely to search African Americans without any suspicion of criminal wrongdoing. Either explanation suggests bias, whether explicit or implicit.40 This lower hit rate for African Americans also underscores that this disparate enforcement practice is ineffective.
Other, more subtle indicators likewise show meaningful disparities in FPD’s search practices: of the 31 Terry stop searches FPD conducted during this period between October 2012 to October 2014, 30 were of black individuals; of the 103 times FPD asked both the driver and passenger to exit a vehicle during a search, the searched individuals were black in 95 cases; and, while only one search of a white person lasted more than half an hour (1% of all searches of white drivers), 59 searches of African Americans lasted that long (5% of all searches of black drivers).
Of all stopped black drivers, 91%, or 8,987, received citations, while 87%, or 1,501, of all stopped white drivers received a citation.41 891 stopped black drivers—10% of all stopped black drivers—were arrested as a result of the stop, whereas only 63 stopped white drivers—4% of all stopped white drivers—were arrested. This disparity is explainable in large part by the high number of black individuals arrested for outstanding municipal warrants issued for missed court payments and appearances. As we discuss below, African Americans are more likely to have warrants issued against them than whites and are more likely to be arrested for an outstanding warrant than their white counterparts. Notably, on 14 occasions FPD listed the only reason for an arrest following a traffic stop as “resisting arrest.” In all 14 of those cases, the person arrested was black.
These disparities in the outcomes that result from traffic stops remain even after regression analysis is used to control for non-race-based variables, including driver age; gender; the assignment of the officer making the stop; disparities in officer behavior; and the stated reason the stop was initiated. Upon accounting for differences in those variables, African Americans remained 2.07 times more likely to be searched; 2.00 times more likely to receive a citation; and 2.37 times more likely to be arrested than other stopped individuals. Each of these
40 Assessing contraband or “hit rates” is a generally accepted practice in the field of criminology to “operationaliz the concept of ‘intent to discriminate.’” The test shows “bias against a protected group if the success rate of searches on that group is lower than on another group.” Nicola Persico & Petra Todd, The Hit Rates Test for Racial Bias in Motor-Vehicle Searches, 25 Justice Quarterly 37, 52 (2008). Indeed, as noted below, in assessing whether racially disparate impact is motivated by discriminatory intent for Equal Protection Clause purposes, disparity can itself provide probative evidence of discriminatory intent.
41 As noted above, African Americans received 90% of all citations issued by FPD from October 2012 to July 2014. This data shows that 86% of people receiving citations following an FPD traffic stop between October 2012 and October 2014 were African American.
66
disparities is statistically significant and would occur by chance less than one time in 1,000.42 The odds of these disparities occurring by chance together are significantly lower still.
ii. Disparate Impact of FPD’s Multiple Citation Practices
The substantial racial disparities that exist within the data collected from traffic stops are consistent with the disparities found throughout FPD’s practices. As discussed above, our investigation found that FPD officers frequently make discretionary choices to issue multiple citations during a single incident. Setting aside the fact that, in some cases, citations are redundant and impose duplicative penalties for the same offense, the issuance of multiples citations also disproportionately impacts African Americans. In 2013, for instance, more than 50% of all African Americans cited received multiple citations during a single encounter with FPD, whereas only 26% of non-African Americans did. Specifically, 26% of African Americans receiving a citation received two citations at once, whereas only 17% of white individuals received two citations at once. Those disparities are even greater for incidents that resulted in more than two citations: 15% of African Americans cited received three citations at the same time, whereas 6% of cited whites received three citations; and while 10% of cited African Americans received four or more citations at once, only 3% of cited whites received that many during a single incident. Each of these disparities is statistically significant, and would occur by chance less than one time in 1,000. Indeed, related data from an overlapping time period shows that, between October 2012 to July 2014, 38 black individuals received four citations during a single incident, compared with only two white individuals; and while 35 black individuals received five or more citations at once, not a single white person did.43
iii. Disparate Impact of Other FPD Charging Practices
From October 2012 to July 2014, African Americans accounted for 85%, or 30,525, of the 35,871 total charges brought by FPD—including traffic citations, summonses, and arrests. Non-African Americans accounted for 15%, or 5,346, of all charges brought during that period.44 These rates vary somewhat across different offenses. For example, African Americans represent a relatively low proportion of those charged with Driving While Intoxicated and Speeding on State Roads or Highways. With respect to speeding offenses for all roads, African Americans account for 72% of citations based on radar or laser, but 80% of citations based on other or unspecified methods. Thus, as evaluated by radar, African Americans violate the law at lower rates than as evaluated by FPD officers. Indeed, controlling for other factors, the disparity in speeding tickets between African Americans and non-African Americans is 48% larger when
42 It is generally accepted practice in the field of statistics to consider any result that would occur by chance less than five times out of 100 to be statistically significant.
43 Similar to the post-stop outcome disparities—which show disparities in FPD practices after an initial stop has been made—these figures show disparities in FPD practices after a decision to issue a citation has been made. Thus, these disparities are not based in any part on population data.
44 Although the state-mandated racial profiling data collected during traffic stops captures ethnicity in addition to race, most other FPD reports capture race only. As a result, these figures for non-African Americans include not only whites, but also non-black Latinos. That FPD’s data collection methods do not consistently capture ethnicity does not affect this report’s analysis of the disparate impact imposed on African Americans, but it has prevented an analysis of whether FPD practices also disparately impact Latinos. In 2010, Latinos comprised 1% of Ferguson’s population. See 2010 Census, U.S. Census Bureau (2010), available at http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_SF1/QTP3/1600000US2923986 (last visited Feb. 26, 2015).
67
citations are issued not on the basis of radar or laser, but by some other method, such as the officer’s own visual assessment. This difference is statistically significant.
Data on charges issued by FPD from 2011-2013 shows that, for numerous municipal offenses for which FPD officers have a high degree of discretion in charging, African Americans are disproportionately represented relative to their representation in Ferguson’s population. While African Americans make up 67% of Ferguson’s population, they make up 95% of Manner of Walking in Roadway charges; 94% of Failure to Comply charges; 92% of Resisting Arrest charges; 92% of Peace Disturbance charges; and 89% of Failure to Obey charges. Because these non-traffic offenses are more likely to be brought against persons who actually live in Ferguson than are vehicle stops, census data here does provide a useful benchmark for whether a pattern of racially disparate policing appears to exist. These disparities mean that African Americans in Ferguson bear the overwhelming burden of FPD’s pattern of unlawful stops, searches, and arrests with respect to these highly discretionary ordinances.
iv. Disparate Impact of FPD Arrests for Outstanding Warrants
FPD records show that once a warrant issues, racial disparities in FPD’s warrant execution practices make it exceedingly more likely for a black individual with an outstanding warrant to be arrested than a white individual with an outstanding warrant. Arrest data captured by FPD often fails to identify when a person is arrested solely on account of an outstanding warrant. Nonetheless, the data FPD collects during traffic stops pursuant to Missouri state requirements does capture information regarding when arrests are made for no other reason than that an arrest warrant was pending. Based upon that data, from October 2012 to October 2014, FPD arrested 460 individuals exclusively because the person had an outstanding arrest warrant. Of those 460 people arrested, 443, or 96%, were black. That African Americans are disproportionately impacted by FPD’s warrant execution practices is also reflected in the fact that, during the roughly six-month period from April to September 2014, African Americans accounted for 96% of those booked into the Ferguson City Jail at least in part because they were arrested for an outstanding municipal warrant.
v. Concerns Regarding Pedestrian Stops
Although available data enables an assessment of the disparate impact of many FPD practices, many other practices cannot be assessed statistically because of FPD’s inadequate data collection. FPD does not reliably collect or track data regarding pedestrian stops, or FPD officers’ conduct during those stops. Given this lack of data, we are unable to determine whether African Americans are disproportionately the subjects of pedestrian stops, or the rate of searches, arrests, or other post-pedestrian stop outcomes. We note, however, that during our investigation we have spoken with not only black community members who have been stopped by FPD officers, but also non-black community members and employees of local businesses who have observed FPD conduct pedestrian stops of others, all of whom universally report that pedestrian stops in Ferguson almost always involve African-American youth. Even though FPD does not specifically track pedestrian stops, other FPD records are consistent with those accounts. Arrest and other incident reports sometimes describe encounters that begin with pedestrian stops, almost all of which involve African Americans.
68
b. Disparate Impact of Court Practices
Our investigation has also found that the rules and practices of the Ferguson municipal court also exert a disparate impact on African Americans. As discussed above, once a charge is filed in Ferguson municipal court, a number of procedural barriers imposed by the court combine to make it unnecessarily difficult to resolve the charge. Data created and maintained by the court show that black defendants are significantly more likely to be adversely impacted by those barriers. An assessment of every charge filed in Ferguson municipal court in 2011 shows that, over time, black defendants are more likely to have their cases persist for longer durations, more likely to face a higher number of mandatory court appearances and other requirements, and more likely to have a warrant issued against them for failing to meet those requirements.45
In light of the opaque court procedures previously discussed, the likelihood of running afoul of a court requirement increases when a case lasts for a longer period of time and results in more court encounters. Court cases involving black individuals typically last longer than those involving white individuals. Of the 2,369 charges filed against white defendants in 2011, over 63% were closed after six months. By contrast, only 34% of the 10,984 charges against black defendants were closed within that time period. 10% of black defendants, however, resolved their case between six months and a year from when it was filed, while 9% of white defendants required that much time to secure resolution. And, while 17% of black defendants resolved their charge over a year after it was brought against them, only 9% of white defendants required that much time. Each of these cases was ultimately resolved, in most instances by satisfying debts owed to the court; but this data shows substantial disparities between blacks and whites regarding how long it took to do so.
On average, African Americans are also more likely to have a high number of “events” occur before a case is resolved. The court’s records track all activities that occur in a case—from payments and court appearances to continuances and Failure to Appear charges. 11% of cases involving African Americans had three “events,” whereas 10% of cases involving white defendants had three events. 14% of cases involving black defendants had four to five events, compared with 9% of cases involving white defendants. Those disparities increase as the recorded number of events per case increases. Data show that there are ten or more events in 17% of cases involving black defendants but only 5% of cases involving white defendants. Given that an “event” can represent a variety of different kinds of occurrences, these particular disparities are perhaps less probative; nonetheless, they strongly suggest that black defendants have, on average, more encounters with the court during a single case than their white peers.
Given the figures above, it is perhaps unsurprising that the municipal court’s practice of issuing warrants to compel fine payments following a missed court appearance or missed payment has a disparate impact on black defendants. 92% of all warrants issued in 2013 were issued in cases involving an African-American defendant. This figure is disproportionate to the representation of African Americans in the court’s docket. Although the proportion of court cases involving black defendants has increased in recent years—81% of all cases filed in 2009,
45 The universe of cases in this and subsequent analyses consisted of cases filed in 2011 because, given that some cases endure for years, a more recent sample would have excluded a greater amount of data from case events that have not yet occurred.
69
compared with 85% of all cases filed in 2013—that proportion remains substantially below the proportion of warrants issued to African Americans.
These disparities are consistent with the evidence discussed above that African Americans are often unable to resolve municipal charges despite taking appropriate steps to do so, and the evidence discussed below suggesting that court officials exercise discretion in a manner that disadvantages the African Americans that appear before the court.
Notably, the evidence suggests that African Americans are not only disparately impacted by court procedures, but also by the court’s discretionary rulings in individual cases. Although court data did not enable a comprehensive assessment of disparities in fines that the court imposes, we did review fine data regarding ten different offenses and offense categories, including the five highly discretionary offenses disproportionately brought against African Americans noted above.46 That analysis suggests that there may be racial disparities in the court’s fine assessment practices. In analyzing the initial fines assessed for those ten offenses for each year from 2011-2013—30 data points in total—the average fine assessment was higher for African Americans than others in 26 of the 30 data points. For example, among the 53 Failure to Obey charges brought in 2013 that did not lead to added Failure to Appear fines—44 of which involved an African-American defendant—African Americans were assessed an average fine of $206, whereas the average fine for others was $147. The magnitude of racial disparities in fine amounts varied across the 30 yearly offense averages analyzed, but those disparities consistently disfavored African Americans.
Further, an evaluation of dismissal rates throughout the life of a case shows that, on average, an African-American defendant is 68% less likely than other defendants to have a case dismissed. In addition to cases that are “Dismissed,” court records also show cases that are “Voided” altogether. There are only roughly 400 cases listed as Voided from 2011-2013, but the data that is available for that relatively small number of Voided cases shows that African Americans are three times less likely to receive the Voided outcome than others.
c. Ferguson’s Racially Disparate Practices Violate Federal Law
This data shows that police and court practices impose a disparate impact on black individuals that itself violates the law. Title VI and the Safe Streets Act prohibit law enforcement agencies that receive federal financial assistance, such as FPD, from engaging in law enforcement activities that have an unnecessary disparate impact based on race, color, or national origin. 42 U.S.C. § 2000d. Title VI’s implementing regulations prohibit law enforcement agencies from using “criteria or methods of administration” that have an unnecessary disparate impact based on race, color, or national origin. 28 C.F.R. § 42.104(b)(2); see also Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 281-82 (2001). Similarly, the Safe Streets Act applies not only to intentional discrimination, but also to any law enforcement practices that
46 The ten offenses or offense categories analyzed include: 1) Manner of Walking in Roadway; 2) Failure to Comply; 3) Resisting Arrest; 4) Peace Disturbance; 5) Failure to Obey; 6) High Grass and Weeds; 7) One Headlight; 8) Expired License Plate; 9) aggregated data for 14 different parking violation offenses; and 10) aggregated data for four different headlight offenses, including: One Headlight; Defective Headlights; No Headlights; and Failure to Maintain Headlights.
70
unnecessarily disparately impact an identified group based on the enumerated factors. 28 C.F.R. § 42.203. Cf. Charleston Housing Authority v. USDA, 419 F.3d 729, 741-42 (8th Cir. 2005) (finding in the related Fair Housing Act context that where official action imposes a racially disparate impact, the action can only be justified through a showing that it is necessary to non-discriminatory objectives).
Thus, under these statutes, the discriminatory impact of Ferguson’s law enforcement practices—which is both unnecessary and avoidable—is unlawful regardless of whether it is intentional or not. As set forth below, these practices also violate the prohibitions against intentional discrimination contained within Title VI, the Safe Streets Act, and the Fourteenth Amendment.
2. Ferguson’s Law Enforcement Practices Are Motivated in Part by Discriminatory Intent in Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment and Other Federal Laws
The race-based disparities created by Ferguson’s law enforcement practices cannot be explained by chance or by any difference in the rates at which people of different races adhere to the law. These disparities occur, at least in part, because Ferguson law enforcement practices are directly shaped and perpetuated by racial bias. Those practices thus operate in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, which prohibits discriminatory policing on the basis of race. Whren, 517 U.S. at 813; Johnson v. Crooks, 326 F.3d 995, 999 (8th Cir. 2003).47
An Equal Protection Clause violation can occur where, as here, the official administration of facially neutral laws or policies results in a discriminatory effect that is motivated, at least in part, by a discriminatory purpose. See Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229, 239-40 (1976). In assessing whether a given practice stems from a discriminatory purpose, courts conduct a “sensitive inquiry into such circumstantial and direct evidence of intent as may be available,” including historical background, contemporaneous statements by decision makers, and substantive departures from normal procedure. Vill. of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266; United States v. Bell, 86 F.3d 820, 823 (8th Cir. 1996). To violate the Equal Protection Clause, official action need not rest solely on racially discriminatory purposes; rather, official action violates the Equal Protection Clause if it is motivated, at least in part, by discriminatory purpose. Personnel Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979).
We have uncovered significant evidence showing that racial bias has impermissibly played a role in shaping the actions of police and court officials in Ferguson. That evidence, detailed below, includes: 1) the consistency and magnitude of the racial disparities found throughout police and court enforcement actions; 2) direct communications by police supervisors and court officials that exhibit racial bias, particularly against African Americans; 3) a number of other communications by police and court officials that reflect harmful racial stereotypes; 4) the background and historic context surrounding FPD’s racially disparate enforcement practices; 5)
47 Ferguson’s discriminatory practices also violate Title VI and the Safe Streets Act, which, in addition to prohibiting some forms of unintentional conduct that has a disparate impact based on race, also prohibit intentionally discriminatory conduct that has a disparate impact. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d; 42 U.S.C. § 3789d.
71
the fact that City, police, and court officials failed to take any meaningful steps to evaluate or address the race-based impact of its law enforcement practices despite longstanding and widely reported racial disparities, and instead consistently reapplied police and court practices known to disparately impact African Americans.
a. Consistency and Magnitude of Identified Racial Disparities
In assessing whether an official action was motivated in part by discriminatory intent, the actual impact of the action and whether it “bears more heavily on one race or another” may “provide an important starting point.” Vill. of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 266 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Indeed, in rare cases, statistical evidence of discriminatory impact may be sufficiently probative to itself establish discriminatory intent. Hazelwood School Dist. v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 307-08 (1977) (noting in the Title VII context that where “gross statistical disparities can be shown, they alone may in a proper case constitute prima facie proof of a pattern or practice of discrimination”).
The race-based disparities we have found are not isolated or aberrational; rather, they exist in nearly every aspect of Ferguson police and court operations. As discussed above, statistical analysis shows that African Americans are more likely to be searched but less likely to have contraband found on them; more likely to receive a citation following a stop and more likely to receive multiple citations at once; more likely to be arrested; more likely to have force used against them; more likely to have their case last longer and require more encounters with the municipal court; more likely to have an arrest warrant issued against them by the municipal court; and more likely to be arrested solely on the basis of an outstanding warrant. As noted above, many of these disparities would occur by chance less than one time in 1000.
These disparities provide significant evidence of discriminatory intent, as the “impact of an official action is often probative of why the action was taken in the first place since people usually intend the natural consequences of their actions.” Reno v. Bossier Parish Sch. Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 487 (1997); see also Davis, 426 U.S. at 242 (“An invidious discriminatory purpose may often be inferred from the totality of the relevant facts, including the fact, if it is true, that the  bears more heavily on one race than another.”). These disparities are unexplainable on grounds other than race and evidence that racial bias, whether implicit or explicit, has shaped law enforcement conduct.48
b. Direct Evidence of Racial Bias
Our investigation uncovered direct evidence of racial bias in the communications of influential Ferguson decision makers. In email messages and during interviews, several court and law enforcement personnel expressed discriminatory views and intolerance with regard to race, religion, and national origin. The content of these communications is unequivocally derogatory, dehumanizing, and demonstrative of impermissible bias.
48 Social psychologists have long recognized the influence of implicit racial bias on decision making, and law enforcement experts have similarly acknowledged the impact of implicit racial bias on law enforcement decisions. See, e.g., R. Richard Banks, Jennifer L. Eberhardt, & Lee Ross, Discrimination and Implicit Bias in a Racially Unequal Society, 94 Cal. L. Rev. 1169 (2006); Tracey G. Gove, Implicit Bias and Law Enforcement, The Police Chief (October 2011).
72
We have discovered evidence of racial bias in emails sent by Ferguson officials, all of whom are current employees, almost without exception through their official City of Ferguson email accounts, and apparently sent during work hours. These email exchanges involved several police and court supervisors, including FPD supervisors and commanders. The following emails are illustrative:
 A November 2008 email stated that President Barack Obama would not be President for very long because “what black man holds a steady job for four years.”
 A March 2010 email mocked African Americans through speech and familial stereotypes, using a story involving child support. One line from the email read: “I be so glad that dis be my last child support payment! Month after month, year after year, all dose payments!”
 An April 2011 email depicted President Barack Obama as a chimpanzee.
 A May 2011 email stated: “An African-American woman in New Orleans was admitted into the hospital for a pregnancy termination. Two weeks later she received a check for $5,000. She phoned the hospital to ask who it was from. The hospital said, ‘Crimestoppers.’”
 A June 2011 email described a man seeking to obtain “welfare” for his dogs because they are “mixed in color, unemployed, lazy, can’t speak English and have no frigging clue who their Daddies are.”
 An October 2011 email included a photo of a bare-chested group of dancing women, apparently in Africa, with the caption, “Michelle Obama’s High School Reunion.”
 A December 2011 email included jokes that are based on offensive stereotypes about Muslims.
Our review of documents revealed many additional email communications that exhibited racial or ethnic bias, as well as other forms of bias. Our investigation has not revealed any indication that any officer or court clerk engaged in these communications was ever disciplined. Nor did we see a single instance in which a police or court recipient of such an email asked that the sender refrain from sending such emails, or any indication that these emails were reported as inappropriate. Instead, the emails were usually forwarded along to others.49
49 We did find one instance in 2012 in which the City Manager forwarded an email that played upon stereotypes of Latinos, but within minutes of sending it, sent another email to the recipient in which he stated he had not seen the offensive part of the email and apologized for the “inappropriate and offensive” message. Police and court staff took no such corrective action, and indeed in many instances expressed amusement at the offensive correspondence.
73
Critically, each of these email exchanges involved supervisors of FPD's patrol and court operations.50 FPD patrol supervisors are responsible for holding officers accountable to governing laws, including the Constitution, and helping to ensure that officers treat all people equally under the law, regardless of race or any other protected characteristic. The racial animus and stereotypes expressed by these supervisors suggest that they are unlikely to hold an officer accountable for discriminatory conduct or to take any steps to discourage the development or perpetuation of racial stereotypes among officers.
Similarly, court supervisors have significant influence and discretion in managing the court’s operations and in processing individual cases. As discussed in Parts I and III.B of this report, our investigation has found that a number of court rules and procedures are interpreted and applied entirely at the discretion of the court clerks. These include: whether to require a court appearance for certain offenses; whether to grant continuances or other procedural requests; whether to accept partial payment of an owed fine; whether to cancel a warrant without a bond payment; and whether to provide individuals with documentation enabling them to have a suspended driver’s license reinstated before the full fine owed has been paid off. Court clerks are also largely responsible for setting bond amounts. The evidence we found thus shows not only racial bias, but racial bias by those with considerable influence over the outcome of any given court case.
This documentary evidence of explicit racial bias is consistent with reports from community members indicating that some FPD officers use racial epithets in dealing with members of the public. We spoke with one African-American man who, in August 2014, had an argument in his apartment to which FPD officers responded, and was immediately pulled out of the apartment by force. After telling the officer, “you don’t have a reason to lock me up,” he claims the officer responded: “N*****, I can find something to lock you up on.” When the man responded, “good luck with that,” the officer slammed his face into the wall, and after the man fell to the floor, the officer said, “don’t pass out motherf****r because I’m not carrying you to my car.” Another young man described walking with friends in July 2014 past a group of FPD officers who shouted racial epithets at them as they passed.
Courts have widely acknowledged that direct statements exhibiting racial bias are exceedingly rare, and that such statements are not necessary for establishing the existence of discriminatory purpose. See, e.g., Hayden v. Paterson, 594 F.3d 150, 163 (2d Cir. 2010) (noting that “discriminatory intent is rarely susceptible to direct proof”); see also Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d 38, 64 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting in Title VII case that “here is no requirement that a plaintiff . . . must present direct, ‘smoking gun’ evidence of racially biased decision making in order to prevail”); Robinson v. Runyon, 149 F.3d 507, 513 (6th Cir. 1998) (noting in Title VII case that “arely will there be direct evidence from the lips of the defendant proclaiming his or her racial animus”). Where such evidence does exist, however, it is highly probative of discriminatory intent. That is particularly true where, as here, the communications exhibiting bias are made by those with considerable decision-making authority. See Doe v.
50 We were able to review far more emails from FPD supervisors than patrol officers. City officials informed us that, while many FPD supervisors have their email accounts on hard drives in the police department, most patrol officers use a form of webmail that does not retain messages once they are deleted.
74
Mamaroneck, 462 F. Supp. 2d 520, 550 (S.D.N.Y. 2006); Eberhart v. Gettys, 215 F. Supp. 2d 666, 678 (M.D.N.C. 2002).
c. Evidence of Racial Stereotyping
Several Ferguson officials told us during our investigation that it is a lack of “personal responsibility” among African-American members of the Ferguson community that causes African Americans to experience disproportionate harm under Ferguson’s approach to law enforcement. Our investigation suggests that this explanation is at odd with the facts. While there are people of all races who may lack personal responsibility, the harm of Ferguson’s approach to law enforcement is largely due to the myriad systemic deficiencies discussed above. Our investigation revealed African Americans making extraordinary efforts to pay off expensive tickets for minor, often unfairly charged, violations, despite systemic obstacles to resolving those tickets. While our investigation did not indicate that African Americans are disproportionately irresponsible, it did reveal that, as the above emails reflect, some Ferguson decision makers hold negative stereotypes about African Americans, and lack of personal responsibility is one of them. Application of this stereotype furthers the disproportionate impact of Ferguson’s police and court practices. It causes court and police decision makers to discredit African Americans’ explanations for not being able to pay tickets and allows officials to disown the harms of Ferguson’s law enforcement practices.
The common practice among Ferguson officials of writing off tickets further evidences a double standard grounded in racial stereotyping. Even as Ferguson City officials maintain the harmful stereotype that black individuals lack personal responsibility—and continue to cite this lack of personal responsibility as the cause of the disparate impact of Ferguson’s practices—white City officials condone a striking lack of personal responsibility among themselves and their friends. Court records and emails show City officials, including the Municipal Judge, the Court Clerk, and FPD supervisors assisting friends, colleagues, acquaintances, and themselves in eliminating citations, fines, and fees. For example:
 In August 2014, the Court Clerk emailed Municipal Judge Brockmeyer a copy of a Failure to Appear notice for a speeding violation issued by the City of Breckenridge, and asked: “ came to me this morning, could you please take  of this for him in Breckenridge?” The Judge replied: “Sure.” Judge Brockmeyer also serves as Municipal Judge in Breckenridge.
 In October 2013, Judge Brockmeyer sent Ferguson’s Prosecuting Attorney an email with the subject line “City of Hazelwood vs. Ronald Brockmeyer.” The Judge wrote: “Pursuant to our conversation, attached please find the red light camera ticket received by the undersigned. I would appreciate it if you would please see to it that this ticket is dismissed.” The Prosecuting Attorney, who also serves as prosecuting attorney in Hazelwood, responded: “I worked on red light matters today and dismissed the ticket that you sent over. Since I entered that into the system today, you may or may not get a second notice – you can just ignore that.”
75
 In August 2013, an FPD patrol supervisor wrote an email entitled “Oops” to the Prosecuting Attorney regarding a ticket his relative received in another municipality for traveling 59 miles per hour in a 40 miles-per-hour zone, noting “aving it dismissed would be a blessing.” The Prosecuting Attorney responded that the prosecutor of that other municipality promised to nolle pros the ticket. The supervisor responded with appreciation, noting that the dismissal “ouldn’t have come at a better time.”
 Also in August 2013, Ferguson’s Mayor emailed the Prosecuting Attorney about a parking ticket received by an employee of a non-profit day camp for which the Mayor sometimes volunteers. The Mayor wrote that the person “shouldn’t have left his car unattended there, but it was an honest mistake” and stated, “I would hate for him to have to pay for this, can you help?” The Prosecuting Attorney forwarded the email to the Court Clerk, instructing her to “NP  this parking ticket.”
 In November 2011, a court clerk received a request from a friend to “fix a parking ticket” received by the friend’s coworker’s wife. After the ticket was faxed to the clerk, she replied: “It’s gone baby!”
 In March 2014, a friend of the Court Clerk’s relative emailed the Court Clerk with a scanned copy of a ticket asking if there was anything she could do to help. She responded: “Your ticket of $200 has magically disappeared!” Later, in June 2014, the same person emailed the Court Clerk regarding two tickets and asked: “Can you work your magic again? It would be deeply appreciated.” The Clerk later informed him one ticket had been dismissed and she was waiting to hear back about the second ticket.
These are just a few illustrative examples. It is clear that writing off tickets between the Ferguson court staff and the clerks of other municipal courts in the region is routine. Email exchanges show that Ferguson officials secured or received ticket write-offs from staff in a number of neighboring municipalities. There is evidence that the Court Clerk and a City of Hazelwood clerk “fixed” at least 12 tickets at each other’s request, and that the Court Clerk successfully sought help with a ticket from a clerk in St. Ann. And in April 2011, a court administrator in the City of Pine Lawn emailed the Ferguson Court Clerk to have a warrant recalled for a person applying for a job with the Pine Lawn Police Department. The court administrator explained that “fter he gets the job, he will have money to pay off his fines with Ferguson.” The Court Clerk recalled the warrant and issued a new court date for more than two months after the request was made.
City officials’ application of the stereotype that African Americans lack “personal responsibility” to explain why Ferguson’s practices harm African Americans, even as these same City officials exhibit a lack of personal—and professional—responsibility in handling their own and their friends’ code violations, is further evidence of discriminatory bias on the part of decision makers central to the direction of law enforcement in Ferguson.
76
d. Historical Background
Until the 1960s, Ferguson was a “sundown town” where African Americans were banned from the City after dark. The City would block off the main road from Kinloch, which was a poor, all-black suburb, “with a chain and construction materials but kept a second road open during the day so housekeepers and nannies could get from Kinloch to jobs in Ferguson.”51 During our investigative interviews, several older African-American residents recalled this era in Ferguson and recounted that African Americans knew that, for them, the City was “off-limits.”
The Ferguson of half a century ago is not the same Ferguson that exists today. We heard from many residents—black and white—who expressed pride in their community, especially with regard to the fact that Ferguson is one of the most demographically diverse communities in the area. Pride in this aspect of Ferguson is well founded; Ferguson is more diverse than most of the United States, and than many of its surrounding cities. It is clear that many Ferguson residents of different races genuinely embrace that diversity.
But we also found evidence during our investigation that some within Ferguson still have difficulty coming to terms with Ferguson’s changing demographics and seeing Ferguson’s African American and white residents as equals in civic life. While total population rates have remained relatively constant over the last three decades, the portion of Ferguson residents who are African American has increased steadily but dramatically, from 25% in 1990 to 67% in 2010. Some individuals, including individuals charged with discretionary enforcement decisions in either the police department or the court, have expressed concerns about the increasing number of African Americans that have moved to Ferguson in recent years. Similarly, some City officials and residents we spoke with explicitly distinguished Ferguson’s African-American residents from Ferguson’s “normal” residents or “regular” people. One white third-generation Ferguson resident told us that in many ways Ferguson is “progressive and quite vibrant,” while in another it is “typical—trying to hang on to its ‘whiteness.’”
On its own, Ferguson’s historical backdrop as a racially segregated community that did not treat African Americans equally under the law does not demonstrate that law enforcement practices today are motivated by impermissible discriminatory intent. It is one factor to consider, however, especially given the evidence that, among some in Ferguson, these attitudes persist today. As courts have instructed, the historical background of an official practice that leads to discriminatory effects is, together with other evidence, probative as to whether that practice is grounded in part in discriminatory purposes. See Vill. of Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 267; see also Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, passim (1982).
e. Failure to Evaluate or Correct Practices that Have Long Resulted in a Racially Disparate Impact
That the discriminatory effect of Ferguson’s law enforcement practices is the result of intentional discrimination is further evidenced by the fact that City, police, and court officials have consistently failed to evaluate or reform—and in fact appear to have redoubled their

commitment to—the very practices that have plainly and consistently exerted a disparate impact on African Americans.
The disparities we have identified appear to be longstanding. The statistical analysis performed as part of our investigation relied upon police and court data from recent years, but FPD has collected data related to vehicle stops pursuant to state requirements since 2000. Each year, that information is gathered by FPD, sent to the office of the Missouri Attorney General, and published on the Missouri Attorney General’s webpage.52 The data show disparate impact on African Americans in Ferguson for as long as that data has been reported. Based on that racial profiling data, Missouri publishes a “Disparity Index” for each reporting municipality, calculated as the percent of stops of a certain racial group compared with that group’s local population rate. In each of the last 14 years, the data show that African Americans are “over represented” in FPD’s vehicular stops.53 That data also shows that in most years, FPD officers searched African Americans at higher rates than others, but found contraband on African Americans at lower rates.
In 2001, for example, African Americans comprised about the same proportion of the population as whites, but while stops of white drivers accounted for 1,495 stops, African Americans accounted for 3,426, more than twice as many. While a white person stopped that year was searched in 6% of cases, a black person stopped was searched in 14% of cases. That same year, searches of whites resulted in a contraband finding in 21% of cases, but searches of African Americans only resulted in a contraband finding in 16% of cases. Similar disparities were identified in most other years, with varying degrees of magnitude. In any event, the data reveals a pattern of racial disparities in Ferguson’s police activities. That pattern appears to have been ignored by Ferguson officials.
That the extant racial disparities are intentional is also evident in the fact that Ferguson has consistently returned to the unlawful practices described in Parts III.A. and B. of this Report knowing that they impose a persistent disparate impact on African Americans. City officials have continued to encourage FPD to stop and cite aggressively as part of its revenue generation efforts, even though that encouragement and increased officer discretion has yielded disproportionate African-American representation in FPD stops and citations. Until we recommended it during our investigation, FPD officials had not restricted officer discretion to issue multiple citations at once, even though the application of that discretion has led officers to issue far more citations to African Americans at once than others, on average, and even though only black individuals (35 in total) ever received five or more citations at once over a three-year period. FPD has not provided further guidance to constrain officer discretion in conducting searches, even though FPD officers have, for years, searched African Americans at higher rates than others but found contraband during those searches less often than in searches of individuals of other races.
52 See Missouri Vehicle Stops Report, Missouri Attorney General, http://ago.mo.gov/VehicleStops/Reports.php?lea=161 (last visited Feb. 13, 2015).
53 Data for the entire state of Missouri shows an even higher “Disparity Index” for those years than the disparity index present in Ferguson. This raises, by the state’s own metric, considerable concerns about policing outside of Ferguson as well.
78
Similarly, City officials have not taken any meaningful steps to contain the discretion of court clerks to grant continuances, clear warrants, or enable driver’s license suspensions to be lifted, even though those practices have resulted in warrants being issued and executed at highly disproportionate rates against African Americans. Indeed, until the City of Ferguson repealed the Failure to Appear statute in September 2014—after this investigation began—the City had not taken meaningful steps to evaluate or reform any of the court practices described in this Report, even though the implementation of those practices has plainly exerted a disparate impact on African Americans.
FPD also has not significantly altered its use-of-force tactics, even though FPD records make clear that current force decisions disparately impact black suspects, and that officers appear to assess threat differently depending upon the race of the suspect. FPD, for example, has not reviewed or revised its canine program, even though available records show that canine officers have exclusively set their dogs against black individuals, often in cases where doing so was not justified by the danger presented. In many incidents in which officers used significant levels of force, the facts as described by the officers themselves did not appear to support the force used, especially in light of the fact that less severe tactics likely would have been equally effective. In some of these incidents, law enforcement experts with whom we consulted could find no explanation other than race to explain the severe tactics used.
During our investigation, FPD officials told us that their police tactics are responsive to the scenario at hand. But records suggest that, where a suspect or group of suspects is white, FPD applies a different calculus, typically resulting in a more measured law enforcement response. In one 2012 incident, for example, officers reported responding to a fight in progress at a local bar that involved white suspects. Officers reported encountering “40-50 people actively fighting, throwing bottles and glasses, as well as chairs.” The report noted that “one subject had his ear bitten off.” While the responding officers reported using force, they only used “minimal baton and flashlight strikes as well as fists, muscling techniques and knee strikes.” While the report states that “due to the amount of subjects fighting, no physical arrests were possible,” it notes also that four subjects were brought to the station for “safekeeping.” While we have found other evidence that FPD later issued a wanted for two individuals as a result of the incident, FPD’s response stands in stark contrast to the actions officers describe taking in many incidents involving black suspects, some of which we earlier described.
Based on this evidence, it is apparent that FPD requires better training, limits on officer discretion, increased supervision, and more robust accountability systems, not only to ensure that officers act in accordance with the Fourth Amendment, but with the Fourteenth Amendment as well. FPD has failed to take any such corrective action, and instead has actively endorsed and encouraged the perpetuation of the practices that have led to such stark disparities. This, together with the totality of the facts that we have found, evidences that those practices exist, at least in part, on account of an unconstitutional discriminatory purpose. See Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279 n.24 (noting that the discriminatory intent inquiry is “practical,” because what “any official entity is ‘up to’ may be plain from the results its actions achieve, or the results they avoid”).

D. Ferguson Law Enforcement Practices Erode Community Trust, Especially Among Ferguson’s African-American Residents, and Make Policing Less Effective, More Difficult, and Less Safe
The unlawful police misconduct and court practices described above have generated great distrust of Ferguson law enforcement, especially among African Americans.54 As described below, other FPD practices further contribute to distrust, including FPD’s failure to hold officers accountable for misconduct, failure to implement community policing principles, and the lack of diversity within FPD. Together, these practices severely damaged the relationship between African Americans and the Ferguson Police Department long before Michael Brown’s shooting death in August 2014. This divide has made policing in Ferguson less effective, more difficult, and more likely to discriminate.
1. Ferguson’s Unlawful Police and Court Practices Have Led to Distrust and Resentment Among Many in Ferguson
The lack of trust between a significant portion of Ferguson’s residents, especially its African-American residents, and the Ferguson Police Department has become, since August 2014, undeniable. The causes of this distrust and division, however, have been the subject of debate. City and police officials, and some other Ferguson residents, have asserted that this lack of meaningful connection with much of Ferguson’s African-American community is due to the fact that they are “transient” renters; that they do not appreciate how much the City of Ferguson does for them; that “pop-culture” portrays alienating themes; or because of “rumors” that the police and municipal court are unyielding because they are driven by raising revenue.
Our investigation showed that the disconnect and distrust between much of Ferguson’s African-American community and FPD is caused largely by years of the unlawful and unfair law enforcement practices by Ferguson’s police department and municipal court described above. In the documents we reviewed, the meetings we observed and participated in, and in the hundreds of conversations Civil Rights Division staff had with residents of Ferguson and the surrounding area, many residents, primarily African-American residents, described being belittled, disbelieved, and treated with little regard for their legal rights by the Ferguson Police Department. One white individual who has lived in Ferguson for 48 years told us that it feels like Ferguson’s police and court system is “designed to bring a black man down . . .  no second chances.” We heard from African-American residents who told us of Ferguson’s “long history of targeting blacks for harassment and degrading treatment,” and who described the steps they take to avoid this—from taking routes to work that skirt Ferguson to moving out of state. An African-American minister of a church in a nearby community told us that he doesn’t allow his two sons to drive through Ferguson out of “fear that they will be targeted for arrest.”
African Americans’ views of FPD are shaped not just by what FPD officers do, but by how they do it. During our investigation, dozens of African Americans in Ferguson told us of
54 Although beyond the scope of this investigation, it appears clear that individuals’ experiences with other law enforcement agencies in St. Louis County, including with the police departments in surrounding municipalities and the County Police, in many instances have contributed to a general distrust of law enforcement that impacts interactions with the Ferguson police and municipal court.
80
verbal abuse by FPD officers during routine interactions, and these accounts are consistent with complaints people have made about FPD for years. In December 2011, for example, an African-American man alleged that as he was standing outside of Wal-Mart, an officer called him a “stupid motherf****r” and a “bastard.” According to the man, a lieutenant was on the scene and did nothing to reproach the officer, instead threatening to arrest the man. In April 2012, officers allegedly called an African-American woman a “bitch” and a “mental case” at the jail following an arrest. In June 2011, a 60-year-old man complained that an officer verbally harassed him while he stood in line to see the judge in municipal court. According to the man, the officer repeatedly ordered him to move forward as the line advanced and, because he did not advance far enough, turned to the other court-goers and joked, “he is hooked on phonics.”
Another concern we heard from many African-American residents, and saw in the files we reviewed, was of casual intimidation by FPD officers, including threats to draw or fire their weapons, often for seemingly little or no cause. In September 2012, a 28-year resident of Ferguson complained to FPD about a traffic stop during which a lieutenant approached with a loud and confrontational manner with his hand on his holstered gun. The resident, who had a military police background, noted that the lieutenant’s behavior, especially having his hand on his gun, ratcheted up the tension level, and he questioned why the lieutenant had been so aggressive. In another incident captured on video and discussed below in more detail, an officer placed his gun on a wall or post and pointed it back and forth to each of two store employees as he talked to them while they took the trash out late one night. In another case discussed above, a person reported that an FPD officer removed his ECW during a traffic stop and continuously tapped the ECW on the roof of the person’s car. These written complaints reported to FPD are consistent with complaints we heard from community members during our investigation about officers casually threatening to hurt or even shoot them.
It appears that many police and City officials were unaware of this distrust and fear of Ferguson police among African Americans prior to August 2014. Ferguson’s Chief, for example, told us that prior to the Michael Brown shooting he thought community-police relations were good. During our investigation, however, City and police leadership, and many officers of all ranks, acknowledged a deep divide between police and some Ferguson residents, particularly black residents. Mayor Knowles acknowledged that there is “clearly mistrust” of FPD by many community members, including a “systemic problem” with youth not wanting to work with police. One FPD officer estimated that about a quarter of the Ferguson community distrusts the police department.
A growing body of research, alongside decades of police experience, is consistent with what our investigation found in Ferguson: that when police and courts treat people unfairly, unlawfully, or disrespectfully, law enforcement loses legitimacy in the eyes of those who have experienced, or even observed, the unjust conduct. See, e.g., Tom R. Tyler & Yuen J. Huo, Trust in the Law: Encouraging Public Cooperation with the Police and Courts (2002). Further, this loss of legitimacy makes individuals more likely to resist enforcement efforts and less likely to cooperate with law enforcement efforts to prevent and investigate crime. See, e.g., Jason Sunshine & Tom R. Tyler, The Role of Procedural Justice and Legitimacy in Shaping Public Support for Policing, 37 Law & Soc’y Rev. 513, 534-36 (2003); Promoting Cooperative Strategies to Reduce Racial Profiling 20-21 (U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Office of Community
81
Oriented Policing Services, 2008) (“Being viewed as fair and just is critical to successful policing in a democracy. When the police are perceived as unfair in their enforcement, it will undermine their effectiveness.”); Ron Davis et al., Exploring the Role of the Police in Prisoner Reentry 13-14 (Nat’l Inst. of Justice, New Perspectives in Policing, July 2012) (“Increasingly, research is supporting the notion that legitimacy is an important factor in the effectiveness of law, and the establishment and maintenance of legitimacy are particularly important in the context of policing.”) (citations omitted). To improve community trust and police effectiveness, Ferguson must ensure not only that its officers act in accord with the Constitution, but that they treat people fairly and respectfully.
2. FPD’s Exercise of Discretion, Even When Lawful, Often Undermines Community Trust and Public Safety
Even where lawful, many discretionary FPD enforcement actions increase distrust and significantly decrease the likelihood that individuals will seek police assistance even when they are victims of crime, or that they will cooperate with the police to solve or prevent other crimes. Chief Jackson told us “we don’t get cooperating witnesses” from the apartment complexes. Consistent with this statement, our review of documents and our conversations with Ferguson residents revealed many instances in which they are reluctant to report being victims of crime or to cooperate with police, and many instances in which FPD imposed unnecessary negative consequences for doing so.
In one instance, for example, a woman called FPD to report a domestic disturbance. By the time the police arrived, the woman’s boyfriend had left. The police looked through the house and saw indications that the boyfriend lived there. When the woman told police that only she and her brother were listed on the home’s occupancy permit, the officer placed the woman under arrest for the permit violation and she was jailed. In another instance, after a woman called police to report a domestic disturbance and was given a summons for an occupancy permit violation, she said, according to the officer’s report, that she “hated the Ferguson Police Department and will never call again, even if she is being killed.”
In another incident, a young African-American man was shot while walking on the road with three friends. The police department located and interviewed two of the friends about the shooting. After the interview, they arrested and jailed one of these cooperating witnesses, who was 19 years old, on an outstanding municipal warrant.
We also reviewed many instances in which FPD officers arrested individuals who sought to care for loved ones who had been hurt. In one instance from May 2014, for example, a man rushed to the scene of a car accident involving his girlfriend, who was badly injured and bleeding profusely when he arrived. He approached and tried to calm her. When officers arrived they treated him rudely, according to the man, telling him to move away from his girlfriend, which he did not want to do. They then immediately proceeded to handcuff and arrest him, which, officers assert, he resisted. EMS and other officers were not on the scene during this arrest, so the accident victim remained unattended, bleeding from her injuries, while officers were arresting the boyfriend. Officers charged the man with five municipal code violations (Resisting Arrest, Disorderly Conduct, Assault on an Officer, Obstructing Government Operations, and Failure to
82
Comply) and had his vehicle towed and impounded. In an incident from 2013, a woman sought to reach her fiancé, who was in a car accident. After she refused to stay on the sidewalk as the officer ordered, she was arrested and jailed. While it is sometimes both essential and difficult to keep distraught family from being in close proximity to their loved ones on the scene of an accident, there is rarely a need to arrest and jail them rather than, at most, detain them on the scene.
Rather than view these instances as opportunities to convey their compassion for individuals at times of crisis even as they maintain order, FPD appears instead to view these and similar incidents we reviewed as opportunities to issue multiple citations and make arrests. For very little public safety benefit, FPD loses opportunities to build community trust and respect, and instead further alienates potential allies in crime prevention.
3. FPD’s Failure to Respond to Complaints of Officer Misconduct Further Erodes Community Trust
Public trust has been further eroded by FPD’s lack of any meaningful system for holding officers accountable when they violate law or policy. Through its system for taking, investigating, and responding to misconduct complaints, a police department has the opportunity to demonstrate that officer misconduct is unacceptable and unrepresentative of how the law enforcement agency values and treats its constituents. In this way, a police department’s internal affairs process provides an opportunity for the department to restore trust and affirm its legitimacy. Similarly, misconduct investigations allow law enforcement the opportunity to provide community members who have been mistreated a constructive, effective way to voice their complaints. And, of course, effective internal affairs processes can be a critical part of correcting officer behavior, and improving police training and policies.
Ferguson’s internal affairs system fails to respond meaningfully to complaints of officer misconduct. It does not serve as a mechanism to restore community members’ trust in law enforcement, or correct officer behavior. Instead, it serves to contrast FPD’s tolerance for officer misconduct against the Department’s aggressive enforcement of even minor municipal infractions, lending credence to a sentiment that we heard often from Ferguson residents: that a “different set of rules” applies to Ferguson’s police than to its African-American residents, and that making a complaint about officer misconduct is futile.
Despite the statement in FPD’s employee misconduct investigation policy that “he integrity of the police department depends on the personal integrity and discipline of each employee,” FPD has done little to investigate external allegations that officers have not followed FPD policy or the law, or, with a few notable exceptions, to hold officers accountable when they have not. Ferguson Police Department makes it difficult to make complaints about officer conduct, and frequently assumes that the officer is telling the truth and the complainant is not, even where objective evidence indicates that the reverse is true.
It is difficult for individuals to make a misconduct complaint against an officer in Ferguson, in part because Ferguson both discourages individuals from making complaints and discourages City and police staff from accepting them. In a March 2014 email, for example, a
83
lieutenant criticized a sergeant for taking a complaint from a man on behalf of his mother, who stayed in her vehicle outside the police station. Despite the fact that Ferguson policy requires that complaints be taken “from any source, identified or anonymous,” the lieutenant stated “I would have had him bring her in, or leave.” In another instance, a City employee took a complaint of misconduct from a Ferguson resident and relayed it to FPD. An FPD captain sent an email in response that the City employee viewed as being “lectured” for taking the complaint. The City Manager agreed, calling the captain’s behavior “not only disrespectful and unacceptable, but it is dangerous in  it is inciteful  and divisive.” Nonetheless, there appeared to be no follow-up action regarding the captain, and the complaint was never logged as such or investigated.
While official FPD policy states clearly that officers must “never attempt to dissuade any citizen from lodging a complaint,” FPD General Order 301.3, a contrary leadership message speaks louder than policy. This message is reflected in statements by officers that indicate a need to justify their actions when they do accept a civilian complaint. In one case, a sergeant explained: “Nothing I could say helped, he demanded the complaint forms which were provided.” In another: “I spoke to  . . . but after the conversation, neither had changed their mind and desired still to write out a complaint.” We saw many instances in which people complained of being prevented from making a complaint, with no indication that FPD investigated those allegations. In one instance, for example, a man alleging significant excessive force reported the incident to a commander after being released from jail, stating that he was unable to make his complaint earlier because several different officers refused to let him speak to a sergeant to make a complaint about the incident and threatened to keep him in jail longer if he did not stop asking to make a complaint.
Some individuals also fear that they will suffer retaliation from officers if they report misconduct or even merely speak out as witnesses when approached by someone from FPD investigating a misconduct complaint. For instance, in one case FPD acknowledged that a witness to the misconduct was initially reluctant to complete a written statement supporting the complainant because he wanted no “repercussions” from the subject officer or other officers. In another case involving alleged misconduct at a retail store that we have already described, the store’s district manager told the commander he did not want an investigation—despite how concerned he was by video footage showing an officer training his gun on two store employees as they took out the trash—because he wanted to “stay on the good side” of the police.
Even when individuals do report misconduct, there is a significant likelihood it will not be treated as a complaint and investigated. In one case, FPD failed to open an investigation of an allegation made by a caller who said an officer had kicked him in the side of the head and stepped on his head and back while he was face down with his hands cuffed behind his back, all the while talking about having blood on him from somebody else and “being tired of the B.S.” The officer did not stop until the other officer on the scene said words to the effect of, “ey, he’s not fighting he’s cuffed.” The man alleged that the officer then ordered him to “get the f*** up” and lifted him by the handcuffs, yanking his arms backward. The commander taking the call reported that the man stated that he supported the police and knew they had a tough job but was reporting the incident because it appeared the officer was under a lot of stress and needed counseling, and because he was hoping to prevent others from having the experience he did. The
84
commander’s email regarding the incident expressed no skepticism about the veracity of the caller’s report and was able to identify the incident (and thus the involved officers). Yet FPD did not conduct an internal affairs investigation of this incident, based on our review of all of FPD’s internal investigation files. There is not even an indication that a use-of-force report was completed.
In another case, an FPD commander wrote to a sergeant that despite a complainant being “pretty adamant that she was profiled and that the officer was rude,” the commander “didn’t even bother to send it to the chief for a control number” before hearing the sergeant’s account of the officer’s side of the story. Upon getting the officer’s account second hand from the sergeant, the commander forwarded the information to the Police Chief so that it could be “filed in the non-complaint file.” FPD officers and commanders also often seek to frame complaints as being entirely related to complainants’ guilt or innocence, and therefore not subject to a misconduct investigation, even though the complaint clearly alleges officer misconduct. In one instance, for example, commanders told the complainant to go to court to fight her arrest, ignoring the complainant’s statement that the officer arrested her for Disorderly Conduct and Failure to Obey only after she asked for the officer’s name. In another instance, a commander stated that the complainant made no allegations unrelated to the merits of the arrest, even though the complainant alleged rudeness and being “intimidated” during arrest, among a number of other non-guilt related allegations.
FPD appears to intentionally not treat allegations of misconduct as complaints even where it believes that the officer in fact committed the misconduct. In one incident, for example, a supervisor wrote an email directly to an officer about a complaint the Police Chief had received about an officer speeding through the park in a neighboring town. The supervisor informed the officer that the Chief tracked the car number given by the complainant back to the officer, but assured the officer that the supervisor’s email was “ust for your information. No need to reply and there is no record of this other than this email.” In another instance referenced above, the district manager of a retail store called a commander to tell him that he had a video recording that showed an FPD officer pull up to the store at about midnight while two employees were taking out the trash, take out his weapon, and put it on top of a concrete wall, pointed at the two employees. When the employees said they were just taking out the trash and asked the officer if he needed them to take off their coats so that he could see their uniforms, the officer told the employees that he knew they were employees and that if he had not known “I would have put you on the ground.” The commander related in an email to the sergeant and lieutenant that “there is no reason to doubt the Gen. Manager because he said he watched the video and he clearly saw a weapon—maybe the sidearm or the taser.” Nonetheless, despite noting that “we don’t need cowboy” and the “major concern” of the officer taking his weapon out of his holster and placing it on a wall, the commander concluded, “othing for you to do with this other than make a mental note and for you to be on the lookout for that kind of behavior.”55
55 This incident raises another concern regarding whether a second-hand informal account of a complaint, often the only record Ferguson retains, conveys the seriousness of the allegation of misconduct. In this illustrative instance, our conversation with a witness to this incident indicates that the officer pointed his weapon at each employee as he spoke to him, and threatened to shoot both, despite knowing that they were simply employees taking out the trash.
85
In another case, an officer investigating a report of a theft at a dollar store interrogated a minister pumping gas into his church van about the theft. The man alleged that he provided his identification to the officer and offered to return to the store to prove he was not the thief. The officer instead handcuffed the man and drove him to the store. The store clerk reported that the detained man was not the thief, but the officer continued to keep the man cuffed, allegedly calling him “f*****g stupid” for asking to be released from the cuffs. The man went directly to FPD to file a complaint upon being released by the officer. FPD conducted an investigation but, because the complainant did not respond to a cell phone message left by the investigator within 13 days, reclassified the complaint as “withdrawn,” even as the investigator noted that the complaint of improper detention would otherwise have been sustained, and noted that the “mployee has been counseled and retraining is forthcoming.” In still another case, a lieutenant of a neighboring agency called FPD to report that a pizza parlor owner had complained to him that an off-duty FPD officer had become angry upon being told that police discounts were only given to officers in uniform and said to the restaurant owner as he was leaving, “I hope you get robbed!” The allegation was not considered a complaint and instead, despite its seriousness, was handled through counseling at the squad level.56
Even where a complaint is actually investigated, unless the complaint is made by an FPD commander, and sometimes not even then, FPD consistently takes the word of the officer over the word of the complainant, frequently even where the officer’s version of events is clearly at odds with the objective evidence. On the rare occasion that FPD does sustain an external complaint of officer misconduct, the discipline it imposes is generally too low to be an effective deterrent.57
Our investigation raised concerns in particular about how FPD responds to untruthfulness by officers. In many departments, a finding of untruthfulness pursuant to internal investigation results in an officer’s termination because the officer’s credibility on police reports and in providing testimony is subsequently subject to challenge. In FPD, untruthfulness appears not even to always result in a formal investigation, and even where sustained, has little effect. In one case we reviewed, FPD sustained a charge of untruthfulness against an officer after he was found to have lied to the investigator about whether he had engaged in an argument with a civilian over the loudspeaker of his police vehicle. FPD imposed only a 12-hour suspension on the officer. In addition, FPD appears not to have taken the officer’s untruthfulness into sufficient account in
56 We found additional examples of FPD officers behaving in public in a manner that reflects poorly on FPD and law enforcement more generally. In November 2010, an officer was arrested for DUI by an Illinois police officer who found his car crashed in a ditch off the highway. Earlier that night he and his squad mates—including his sergeant—were thrown out of a bar for bullying a customer. The officer received a thirty-day suspension for the DUI. Neither the sergeant nor any officers was disciplined for their behavior in the bar. In September 2012, an officer stood by eating a sandwich while a fight broke out at an annual street festival. After finally getting involved to break up the fight, he publically berated and cursed at his squad mates, screamed and cursed at the two female street vendors who were fighting, and pepper-sprayed a handcuffed female arrestee in the back of his patrol car. The officer received a written reprimand.
57 While the Chief’s “log” of Internal Affairs (“IA”) investigations contains many sustained allegations, most of these were internally generated; that is, the complaint was made by an FPD employee, usually a commander. In addition, we found that a majority of complaints are never investigated as IA cases, or even logged as complaints. The Chief’s log, which he told us included all complaint investigations, includes 56 investigations from January 2010 through July 2014. Our review indicates that there were significantly more complaints of misconduct during this time period. Despite repeated requests, FPD provided us no other record of complaints received or investigated.
86
several subsequent complaints, including in at least one case in which the complainant alleged conduct very similar to that alleged in the case in which FPD found the officer untruthful. Nor, as discussed above, has FPD or the City disclosed this information to defendants challenging charges brought by the officer. In another case a supervisor was sustained for false testimony during an internal affairs investigation and was given a written reprimand. In another case in which an officer was clearly untruthful, FPD did not sustain the charge.58 In that case, an officer in another jurisdiction was assigned to monitor an intersection in that city because an FPD-marked vehicle allegedly had repeatedly been running the stop sign at that intersection. While at that intersection, and while receiving a complaint from a person about the FPD vehicle, the officer saw that very vehicle “dr through the stop sign without tapping a brake,” according to a sergeant with the other jurisdiction. When asked to respond to these allegations, the officer wrote, unequivocally, “I assure you I don’t run stop signs.” It is clear from the investigative file that FPD found that he did, in fact, run stop signs, as the officer was given counseling. Nonetheless, the officer received a counseling memo that made no mention of the officer’s written denial of the misconduct observed by another law enforcement officer. This officer continues to write reports regarding significant uses of force, several of which our investigation found questionable.59
By failing to hold officers accountable, FPD leadership sends a message that FPD officers can behave as they like, regardless of law or policy, and even if caught, that punishment will be light. This message serves to condone officer misconduct and fuel community distrust.
4. FPD’s Lack of Community Engagement Increases the Likelihood of Discriminatory Policing and Damages Public Trust
Alongside its divisive law enforcement practices and lack of meaningful response to community concerns about police conduct, FPD has made little effort in recent years to employ community policing or other community engagement strategies. This lack of community engagement has precluded the possibility of bridging the divide caused by Ferguson’s law enforcement practices, and has increased the likelihood of discriminatory policing.
Community policing and related community engagement strategies provide the opportunity for officers and communities to work together to identify the causes of crime and disorder particular to their community, and to prioritize law enforcement efforts. See Community Policing Defined 1-16 (U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, 2014). The focus of these strategies—in stark contrast to Ferguson’s current law enforcement approach—is on crime prevention rather than on making arrests. See Effective Policing and Crime Prevention: A Problem Oriented Guide for Mayors, City Managers, and County Executives 1-62 (U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, 2009). When implemented fully, community policing creates opportunities for officers and community
58 FPD may have initially accepted this as a formal complaint, but then informally withdrew it after completion of the investigation. No rationale is provided for doing so, but the case does not appear on the Chief’s IA investigation log, and another case with this same IA number appears instead.
59 Our review of FPD’s handling of misconduct complaints is just one source of our concern about FPD’s efforts to ensure that officers are truthful in their reports and testimony, and to take appropriate measures when they are not. As discussed above, our review of FPD offense and force reports also raises this concern.
87
members to have frequent, positive interactions with each other, and requires officers to partner with communities to solve particular public safety problems that, together, they have decided to address. Research and experience show that community policing can be more effective at crime prevention and at making people feel safer. See Gary Cordner, Reducing Fear of Crime: Strategies for Police 47 (U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, Jan. 2010) (“Most studies of community policing have found that residents like community policing and feel safer when it is implemented where they live and work.”) (citations omitted).
Further, research and law enforcement experience show that community policing and engagement can overcome many of the divisive dynamics that disconnected Ferguson residents and City leadership alike describe, from a dearth of positive interactions to racial stereotyping and racial violence. See, e.g., Glaser, supra, at 207-11 (discussing research showing that community policing and similar approaches can help reduce racial bias and stereotypes and improve community relations); L. Song Richardson & Phillip Atiba Goff, Interrogating Racial Violence, 12 Ohio St. J. of Crim. L. 115, 143-47 (2014) (describing how fully implemented and inclusive community policing can help avoid racial stereotyping and violence); Strengthening the Relationship Between Law Enforcement and Communities of Color: Developing an Agenda for Action 1-20 (U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, 2014).
Ferguson’s community policing efforts appear always to have been somewhat modest, but have dwindled to almost nothing in recent years. FPD has no community policing or community engagement plan. FPD currently designates a single officer the “Community Resource Officer.” This officer attends community meetings, serves as FPD’s public relations liaison, and is charged with collecting crime data. No other officers play any substantive role in community policing efforts. Officers we spoke with were fairly consistent in their acknowledgment of this, and of the fact that this move away from community policing has been due, at least in part, to an increased focus on code enforcement and revenue generation in recent years. As discussed above, our investigation found that FPD redeployed officers to 12-hour shifts, in part for revenue reasons. There is some evidence that community policing is more difficult to carry out when patrol officers are on 12-hour shifts, and this appears to be the case in Ferguson. While many officers in Ferguson support 12-hour shifts, several told us that the 12-hour shift has undermined community policing. One officer said that “FPD used to have a strong community policing ethic—then we went to a 12-hour day.” Another officer told us that the 12-hour schedule, combined with a lack of any attempt to have officers remain within their assigned area, has resulted in a lack of any geographical familiarity by FPD officers. This same officer told us that it is viewed as more positive to write tickets than to “talk with your businesses.” Another officer told us that FPD officers should put less energy into writing tickets and instead “get out of their cars” and get to know community members.
One officer told us that officers could spend more time engaging with community members and undertaking problem-solving projects if FPD officers were not so focused on activities that generate revenue. This officer told us, “everything’s about the courts . . . the court’s enforcement priorities are money.” Another officer told us that officers cannot “get out of the car and play basketball with the kids,” because “we’ve removed all the basketball hoops—there’s an ordinance against it.” While one officer told us that there was a police substation in
88
Canfield Green when FPD was more committed to community policing, another told us that now there is “nobody in there that anybody knows.”
City and police officials note that there are several active neighborhood groups in Ferguson. We reached out to each of these during our investigation and met with each one that responded. Some areas of Ferguson are well-represented by these groups. But City and police officials acknowledge that, since August 2014, they have realized that there are entire segments of the Ferguson community that they have never made an effort to know, especially African Americans who live in Ferguson’s large apartment complexes, including Canfield Green. While some City officials appear well-intentioned, they have also been too quick to presume that outreach to more disconnected segments of the Ferguson community will be futile. One City employee told us, “they think they do outreach, but they don’t,” and that some Ferguson residents do not even realize their homes are in Ferguson. Our investigation indicated that, while the City and police department may have to use different strategies for engagement in some parts of Ferguson than in others, true community policing efforts can have positive results. As an officer who has patrolled the area told us, “most of the people in Canfield are good people. They just don’t have a lot of time to get involved.”
5. Ferguson’s Lack of a Diverse Police Force Further Undermines Community Trust
While approximately two-thirds of Ferguson’s residents are African American, only four of Ferguson’s 54 commissioned police officers are African American. Since August 2014, there has been widespread discussion about the impact this comparative lack of racial diversity within FPD has on community trust and police behavior. During this investigation we also heard repeated complaints about FPD’s lack of racial diversity from members of the Ferguson community. Our investigation indicates that greater diversity within Ferguson Police Department has the potential to increase community confidence in the police department, but may only be successful as part of a broader police reform effort.
While it does appear that a lack of racial diversity among officers decreases African Americans’ trust in a police department, this observation must be qualified. Increasing a police department’s racial diversity does not necessarily increase community trust or improve officer conduct. There appear to be many reasons for this. One important reason is that African-American officers can abuse and violate the rights of African-American civilians, just as white officers can. And African-American officers who behave abusively can undermine community trust just as white officers can. Our investigation indicates that in Ferguson, individual officer behavior is largely driven by a police culture that focuses on revenue generation and is infected by race bias. While increased vertical and horizontal diversity, racial and otherwise, likely is necessary to change this culture, it probably cannot do so on its own.
Consistent with our findings in Ferguson and other departments, research more broadly shows that a racially diverse police force does not guarantee community trust or lawful policing. See Diversity in Law Enforcement: A Literature Review 4 n.v. (U.S. Dep’t of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Office of Justice Programs, & U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Submission to President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing, Jan. 2015). The
89
picture is far more complex. Some studies show that Africa-American officers are less prejudiced than white officers as a whole, are more familiar with African-American communities, are more likely to arrest white suspects and less likely to arrest black suspects, and receive more cooperation from African Americans with whom they interact on the job. See David A. Sklansky, Not Your Father’s Police Department: Making Sense of the New Demographics of Law Enforcement, 96 J. Crim. L. & Criminology 1209, 1224-25 (2006). But studies also show that African Americans are equally likely to fire their weapons, arrest people, and have complaints made about their behavior, and sometimes harbor prejudice against African-American civilians themselves. Id.
While a diverse police department does not guarantee a constitutional one, it is nonetheless critically important for law enforcement agencies, and the Ferguson Police Department in particular, to strive for broad diversity among officers and civilian staff. In general, notwithstanding the above caveats, a more racially diverse police department has the potential to increase confidence in police among African Americans in particular. See Joshua C. Cochran & Patricia Y. Warren, Racial, Ethnic, and Gender Differences in, Perceptions of the Police: The Salience of Officer Race Within the Context of Racial Profiling, 28(2) J. Contemp. Crim. Just. 206, 206-27 (2012). In addition, diversity of all types—including race, ethnicity, sex, national origin, religion, sexual orientation and gender identity—can be beneficial both to police-community relationships and the culture of the law enforcement agency. Increasing gender and sexual orientation diversity in policing in particular may be critical in re-making internal police culture and creating new assumptions about what makes policing effective. See, e.g., Sklansky, supra, at 1233-34; Richardson & Goff, supra, at 143-47; Susan L. Miller, Kay B. Forest, & Nancy C. Jurik, Diversity in Blue, Lesbian and Gay Police Officers in a Masculine Occupation, 5 Men and Masculinities 355, 355-85 (Apr. 2003).60 Moreover, aside from the beneficial impact a diverse police force may have on the culture of the department and police-community relations, police departments are obligated under law to provide equal opportunity for employment. See Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.
Our investigation indicates that Ferguson can and should do more to attract and hire a more diverse group of qualified police officers.61 However, for these efforts to be successful at increasing the diversity of its workforce, as well as effective at increasing community trust and improving officer behavior, they must be part of a broader reform effort within FPD. This reform effort must focus recruitment efforts on attracting qualified candidates of all demographics with the skills and temperament to police respectfully and effectively, and must ensure that all officers—regardless of race—are required to police lawfully and with integrity.
60 While the emphasis in Ferguson has been on racial diversity, FPD also, like many police agencies, has strikingly disparate gender diversity: in Ferguson, approximately 55% of residents are female, but FPD has only four female officers. See 2010 Census, U.S. Census Bureau (2010), available at factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC /10_DP/DPDP1/1600000US2923986 (last visited Feb. 26, 2015). During our investigation we received many complaints about FPD’s lack of gender diversity as well.
61 While not the focus of our investigation, the information we reviewed indicated that Ferguson’s efforts to retain qualified female and black officers may be compromised by the same biases we saw more broadly in the department. In particular, while the focus of our investigation did not permit us to reach a conclusive finding, we found evidence that FPD tolerates sexual harassment by male officers, and has responded poorly to allegations of sexual harassment that have been made by female officers.

V. CHANGES NECESSARY TO REMEDY FERGUSON’S UNLAWFUL LAW ENFORCEMENT PRACTICES AND REPAIR COMMUNITY TRUST
The problems identified within this letter reflect deeply entrenched practices and priorities that are incompatible with lawful and effective policing and that damage community trust. Addressing those problems and repairing the City’s relationship with the community will require a fundamental redirection of Ferguson’s approach to law enforcement, including the police and court practices that reflect and perpetuate this approach.
Below we set out broad recommendations for changes that Ferguson should make to its police and court practices to correct the constitutional violations our investigation identified. Ensuring meaningful, sustainable, and verifiable reform will require that these and other measures be part of a court-enforceable remedial process that includes involvement from community stakeholders as well as independent oversight. In the coming weeks, we will seek to work with the City of Ferguson toward developing and reaching agreement on an appropriate framework for reform.
A. Ferguson Police Practices
1. Implement a Robust System of True Community Policing
Many of the recommendations included below would require a shift from policing to raise revenue to policing in partnership with the entire Ferguson community. Developing these relationships will take time and considerable effort. FPD should:
a. Develop and put into action a policy and detailed plan for comprehensive implementation of community policing and problem-solving principles. Conduct outreach and involve the entire community in developing and implementing this plan;
b. Increase opportunities for officers to have frequent, positive interactions with people outside of an enforcement context, especially groups that have expressed high levels of distrust of police. Such opportunities may include police athletic leagues and similar informal activities;
c. Develop community partnerships to identify crime prevention priorities, with a focus on disconnected areas, such as Ferguson’s apartment complexes, and disconnected groups, such as much of Ferguson’s African-American youth;
d. Modify officer deployment patterns and scheduling (such as moving away from the current 12-hour shift and assigning officers to patrol the same geographic areas consistently) to facilitate participating in crime prevention projects and familiarity with areas and people;
e. Train officers on crime-prevention, officer safety, and anti-discrimination advantages of community policing. Train officers on mechanics of community policing and their role in implementing it;
f. Measure and evaluate individual, supervisory, and agency police performance on community engagement, problem-oriented-policing projects, and crime prevention, rather than on arrest and citation productivity.
91
2. Focus Stop, Search, Ticketing and Arrest Practices on Community Protection
FPD must fundamentally change the way it conducts stops and searches, issues citations and summonses, and makes arrests. FPD officers must be trained and required to abide by the law. In addition, FPD enforcement efforts should be reoriented so that officers are required to take enforcement action because it promotes public safety, not simply because they have legal authority to act. To do this, FPD should:
a. Prohibit the use of ticketing and arrest quotas, whether formal or informal;
b. Require that officers report in writing all stops, searches and arrests, including pedestrian stops, and that their reports articulate the legal authority for the law enforcement action and sufficient description of facts to support that authority;
c. Require documented supervisory approval prior to:
1) Issuing any citation/summons that includes more than two charges;
2) Making an arrest on any of the following charges:
i. Failure to Comply/Obey;
ii. Resisting Arrest;
iii. Disorderly Conduct/Disturbing the Peace;
iv. Obstruction of Government Operations;
3) Arresting or ticketing an individual who sought police aid, or who is cooperating with police in an investigation;
4) Arresting on a municipal warrant or wanted;
d. Revise Failure to Comply municipal code provision to bring within constitutional limits, and provide sufficient guidance so that all stops, citations, and arrests based on the provision comply with the Constitution;
e. Train officers on proper use of Failure to Comply charge, including elements of the offense and appropriateness of the charge for interference with police activity that threatens public safety;
f. Require that applicable legal standards are met before officers conduct pat-downs or vehicle searches. Prohibit searches based on consent for the foreseeable future;
g. Develop system of correctable violation, or “fix-it” tickets, and require officers to issue fix-it tickets wherever possible and absent contrary supervisory instruction;
h. Develop and implement policy and training regarding appropriate police response to activities protected by the First Amendment, including the right to observe, record, and protest police action;
i. Provide initial and regularly recurring training on Fourth Amendment constraints on police action, as well as responsibility within FPD to constrain action beyond what Fourth Amendment requires in interest of public safety and community trust;
j. Discontinue use of “wanteds” or “stop orders” and prohibit officers from conducting stops, searches, or arrests on the basis of “wanteds” or “stop orders” issued by other agencies.
3. Increase Tracking, Review, and Analysis of FPD Stop, Search, Ticketing and Arrest Practices
At the first level of supervision and as an agency, FPD must review more stringently officers’ stop, search, ticketing, and arrest practices to ensure that officers are complying with the
92
Constitution and department policy, and to evaluate the impact of officer activity on police legitimacy and community trust. FPD should:
a. Develop and implement a plan for broader collection of stop, search, ticketing, and arrest data that includes pedestrian stops, enhances vehicle stop data collection, and requires collection of data on all stop and post-stop activity, as well as location and demographic information;
b. Require supervisors to review all officer activity and review all officer reports before the supervisor leaves shift;
c. Develop and implement system for regular review of stop, search, ticketing, and arrest data at supervisory and agency level to detect problematic trends and ensure consistency with public safety and community policing goals;
d. Analyze race and other disparities shown in stop, search, ticketing, and arrest practices to determine whether disparities can be reduced consistent with public safety goals.
4. Change Force Use, Reporting, Review, and Response to Encourage De-Escalation and the Use of the Minimal Force Necessary in a Situation
FPD should reorient officers’ approach to using force by ensuring that they are trained and skilled in using tools and tactics to de-escalate situations, and incentivized to avoid using force wherever possible. FPD also should implement a system of force review that ensures that improper force is detected and responded to effectively, and that policy, training, tactics, and officer safety concerns are identified. FPD should:
a. Train and require officers to use de-escalation techniques wherever possible both to avoid a situation escalating to where force becomes necessary, and to avoid unnecessary force even where it would be legally justified. Training should include tactics for slowing down a situation to increase available options;
b. Require onsite supervisory approval before deploying any canine, absent documented exigent circumstances; require and train canine officers to take into account the nature and severity of the alleged crime when deciding whether to deploy a canine to bite; require and train canine officers to avoid sending a canine to apprehend by biting a concealed suspect when the objective facts do not suggest the suspect is armed and a lower level of force reasonably can be expected to secure the suspect;
c. Place more stringent limits on use of ECWs, including limitations on multiple ECW cycles and detailed justification for using more than one cycle;
d. Retrain officers in use of ECWs to ensure they view and use ECWs as a tool of necessity, not convenience. Training should be consistent with principles set out in the 2011 ECW Guidelines;
e. Develop and implement use-of-force reporting that requires the officer using force to complete a narrative, separate from the offense report, describing the force used with particularity, and describing with specificity the circumstances that required the level of force used, including the reason for the initial stop or other enforcement action. Some levels of force should require all officers observing the use of force to complete a separate force narrative;
f. Develop and implement supervisory review of force that requires the supervisor to conduct a complete review of each use of force, including gathering and considering
93
evidence necessary to understand the circumstances of the force incident and determine its consistency with law and policy, including statements from individuals against whom force is used and civilian witnesses;
g. Prohibit supervisors from reviewing or investigating a use of force in which they participated or directed;
h. Ensure that complete use-of-force reporting and review/investigation files—including all offense reports, witness statements, and medical, audio/video, and other evidence—are kept together in a centralized location;
i. Develop and implement a system for higher-level, inter-disciplinary review of some types of force, such as lethal force, canine deployment, ECWs, and force resulting in any injury;
j. Improve collection, review, and response to use-of-force data, including information regarding ECW and canine use;
k. Implement system of zero tolerance for use of force as punishment or retaliation rather than as necessary, proportionate response to counter a threat;
l. Discipline officers who fail to report force and supervisors who fail to conduct adequate force investigations;
m. Identify race and other disparities in officer use of force and develop strategies to eliminate avoidable disparities;
n. Staff jail with at least two correctional officers at all times to ensure safety and minimize need for use of force in dealing with intoxicated or combative prisoners. Train correctional officers in de-escalation techniques with specific instruction and training on minimizing force when dealing with intoxicated and combative prisoners, as well as with passive resistance and noncompliance.
5. Implement Policies and Training to Improve Interactions with Vulnerable People
Providing officers with the tools and training to better respond to persons in physical or mental health crisis, and to those with intellectual disabilities, will help avoid unnecessary injuries, increase community trust, and make officers safer. FPD should:
a. Develop and implement policy and training for identifying and responding to individuals with known or suspected mental health conditions, including those observably in mental health crisis, and those with intellectual or other disabilities;
b. Provide enhanced crisis intervention training to a subset of officers to allow for ready availability of trained officers on the scenes of critical incidents involving individuals with mentally illness;
c. Require that, wherever possible, at least one officer with enhanced crisis intervention training respond to any situation concerning individuals in mental health crisis or with intellectual disability, when force might be used;
d. Provide training to officers regarding how to identify and respond to more commonly occurring medical emergencies that may at first appear to reflect a failure to comply with lawful orders. Such medical emergencies may include, for example, seizures and diabetic emergencies.
94
6. Change Response to Students to Avoid Criminalizing Youth While Maintaining a Learning Environment
FPD has the opportunity to profoundly impact students through its SRO program. This program can be used as a way to build positive relationships with youth from a young age and to support strategies to keep students in school and learning. FPD should:
a. Work with school administrators, teachers, parents, and students to develop and implement policy and training consistent with law and best practices to more effectively address disciplinary issues in schools. This approach should be focused on SROs developing positive relationships with youth in support of maintaining a learning environment without unnecessarily treating disciplinary issues as criminal matters or resulting in the routine imposition of lengthy suspensions;
b. Provide initial and regularly recurring training to SROs, including training in mental health, counseling, and the development of the teenage brain;
c. Evaluate SRO performance on student engagement and prevention of disturbances, rather than on student arrests or removals;
d. Regularly review and evaluate incidents in which SROs are involved to ensure they meet the particular goals of the SRO program; to identify any disparate impact or treatment by race or other protected basis; and to identify any policy, training, or equipment concerns.
7. Implement Measures to Reduce Bias and Its Impact on Police Behavior
Many of the recommendations listed elsewhere have the potential to reduce the level and impact of bias on police behavior (e.g., increasing positive interactions between police and the community; increasing the collection and analysis of stop data; and increasing oversight of the exercise of police discretion). Below are additional measures that can assist in this effort. FPD should:
a. Provide initial and recurring training to all officers that sends a clear, consistent and emphatic message that bias-based profiling and other forms of discriminatory policing are prohibited. Training should include:
1) Relevant legal and ethical standards;
2) Information on how stereotypes and implicit bias can infect police work;
3) The importance of procedural justice and police legitimacy on community
trust, police effectiveness, and officer safety;
4) The negative impacts of profiling on public safety and crime prevention;
b. Provide training to supervisors and commanders on detecting and responding to bias-based profiling and other forms of discriminatory policing;
c. Include community members from groups that have expressed high levels of distrust of police in officer training;
d. Take steps to eliminate all forms of workplace bias from FPD and the City.
8. Improve and Increase Training Generally
FPD officers receive far too little training as recruits and after becoming officers. Officers need a better knowledge of what law, policy, and integrity require, and concrete training on how to
95
carry out their police responsibilities. In addition to the training specified elsewhere in these recommendations, FPD should:
a. Significantly increase the quality and amount of all types of officer training, including recruit, field training (including for officers hired from other agencies), and in-service training;
b. Require that training cover, in depth, constitutional and other legal restrictions on officer action, as well as additional factors officers should consider before taking enforcement action (such as police legitimacy and procedural justice considerations);
c. Employ scenario-based and adult-learning methods.
9. Increase Civilian Involvement in Police Decision Making
In addition to engaging with all segments of Ferguson as part of implementing community policing, FPD should develop and implement a system that incorporates civilian input into all aspects of policing, including policy development, training, use-of-force review, and investigation of misconduct complaints.
10. Improve Officer Supervision
The recommendations set out here cannot be implemented without dedicated, skilled, and well-trained supervisors who police lawfully and without bias. FPD should:
a. Provide all supervisors with specific supervisory training prior to assigning them to supervisory positions;
b. Develop and require supervisors to use an “early intervention system” to objectively detect problematic patterns of officer misconduct, assist officers who need additional attention, and identify training and equipment needs;
c. Support supervisors who encourage and guide respectful policing and implement community policing principles, and evaluate them on this basis. Remove supervisors who do not adequately review officer activity and reports or fail to support, through words or actions, unbiased policing;
d. Ensure that an adequate number of qualified first-line supervisors are deployed in the field to allow supervisors to provide close and effective supervision to each officer under the supervisor’s direct command, provide officers with the direction and guidance necessary to improve and develop as officers, and to identify, correct, and prevent misconduct.
11. Recruiting, Hiring, and Promotion
There are widespread concerns about the lack of diversity, especially race and gender diversity, among FPD officers. FPD should modify its systems for recruiting hiring and promotion to:
a. Ensure that the department’s officer hiring and selection processes include an objective process for selection that employs reliable and valid selection devices that comport with best practices and federal anti-discrimination laws;
b. In the case of lateral hires, scrutinize prior training and qualification records as well as complaint and disciplinary history;
96
c. Implement validated pre-employment screening mechanisms to ensure temperamental and skill-set suitability for policing.
12. Develop Mechanisms to More Effectively Respond to Allegations of Officer Misconduct
Responding to allegations of officer misconduct is critical not only to correct officer behavior and identify policy, training, or tactical concerns, but also to build community confidence and police legitimacy. FPD should:
a. Modify procedures and practices for accepting complaints to make it easier and less intimidating for individuals to register formal complaints about police conduct, including providing complaint forms online and in various locations throughout the City and allowing for complaints to be submitted online and by third parties or anonymously;
b. Require that all complaints be logged and investigated;
c. Develop and implement a consistent, reliable, and fair process for investigating and responding to complaints of officer misconduct. As part of this process, FPD should:
1) Investigate all misconduct complaints, even where the complainant indicates
he or she does not want the complaint investigated, or wishes to remain
anonymous;
2) Not withdraw complaints without reaching a disposition;
d. Develop and implement a fair and consistent system for disciplining officers found to have committed misconduct;
e. Terminate officers found to have been materially untruthful in performance of their duties, including in completing reports or during internal affairs investigations;
f. Timely provide in writing to the Ferguson Prosecuting Attorney all impeachment information on officers who may testify or provide sworn reports, including findings of untruthfulness in internal affairs investigations, for disclosure to the defendant under Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963);
g. Document in a central location all misconduct complaints and investigations, including the nature of the complaint, the name of the officer, and the disposition of the investigation;
h. Maintain complete misconduct complaint investigative files in a central location;
i. Develop and implement a community-centered mediation program to resolve, as appropriate, allegations of officer misconduct.
13. Publically Share Information about the Nature and Impact of Police Activities
Transparency is a key component of good governance and community trust. Providing broad information to the public also facilitates constructive community engagement. FPD should:
a. Provide regular and specific public reports on police stop, search, arrest, ticketing, force, and community engagement activities, including particular problems and achievements, and describing the steps taken to address concerns;
b. Provide regular public reports on allegations of misconduct, including the nature of the complaint and its resolution;
c. Make available online and regularly update a complete set of police policies.
97
B. Ferguson Court Practices
1. Make Municipal Court Processes More Transparent
Restoring the legitimacy of the municipal justice system requires increased transparency regarding court operations to allow the public to assess whether the court is operating in a fair manner. The municipal court should:
a. Make public—through a variety of means, including prominent display on the City, police, and municipal court web pages—all court-related fines, fees, and bond amounts, and a description of the municipal court payment process, including court dates, payment options, and potential consequences for non-payment or missed court dates;
b. Create, adopt, and make public written procedures for all court operations;
c. Collect all orders currently in effect and make those orders accessible to the public, including by posting any such materials on the City, police, and municipal court web pages. Make public all new court orders and directives as they are issued;
d. Initiate a public education campaign to ensure individuals can have an accurate and complete understanding of how Ferguson’s municipal court operates, including that appearance in court without ability to pay an owed fine will not result in arrest;
e. Provide broadly available information to individuals regarding low-cost or cost-free legal assistance;
f. Enhance public reporting by ensuring data provided to the Missouri Courts Administrator is accurate, and by making that and additional data available on City and court websites, including monthly reports indicating:
1) The number of warrants issued and currently outstanding;
2) The number of cases heard during the previous month;
3) The amount of fines imposed and collected, broken down by offense, including by race;
4) Data regarding the number of Missouri Department of Revenue license suspensions initiated by the court and the number of compliance letters enabling license reinstatement issued by the court.
g. Revise the municipal court website to enable these recommendations to be fully implemented.
2. Provide Complete and Accurate Information to a Person Charged with a Municipal Violation
In addition to making its processes more transparent to the public, the court should ensure that those with cases pending before the court are provided with adequate and reliable information about their case. The municipal court, in collaboration with the Patrol Division, should:
a. Ensure all FPD citations, summonses, and arrests are accompanied by sufficient, detailed information about the recipient’s rights and responsibilities, including:
1) The specific municipal violation charged;
2) A person’s options for addressing the charge, including whether in-person appearance is required or if alternative methods, including online payment, are available, and information regarding all pending deadlines;
98
3) A person’s right to challenge the charge in court;
4) The exact date and time of the court session at which the person receiving the charge must or may appear;
5) Information about how to seek a continuance for a court date;
6) The specific fine imposed, if the offense has a preset fine;
7) The processes available to seek a fine reduction for financial incapacity, consistent with recommendation four set forth below;
8) The penalties for failing to meet court requirements.
b. Develop and implement a secure online system for individuals to be able to access specific details about their case, including fines owed, payments made, and pending requirements and deadlines.
3. Change Court Procedures for Tracking and Resolving Municipal Charges to Simplify Court Processes and Expand Available Payment Options
The municipal court should:
a. Strictly limit those offenses requiring in-person court appearance for resolution to those for which state law requires the defendant to make an initial appearance in court;
b. Establish a process by which a person may seek a continuance of a court date, whether or not represented by counsel;
c. Continue to implement its online payment system, and expand it to allow late payments, payment plan installments, bond payments, and other court payments to be made online;
d. Continue to develop and transition to an electronic records management system for court records to ensure all case information and events are tracked and accessible to court officials and FPD staff, as appropriate. Ensure electronic records management system has appropriate controls to limit user access and ability to alter case records;
e. Ensure that the municipal court office is consistently staffed during posted business hours to allow those appearing at the court window of the police department seeking to resolve municipal charges to do so;
f. Accept partial payments from individuals, and provide clear information to individuals about payment plan options.
4. Review Preset Fine Amounts and Implement System for Fine Reduction
The municipal court should:
a. Immediately undertake a review of current fine amounts and ensure that they are consistent not only with regional but also statewide fine averages, are not overly punitive, and take into account the income of Ferguson residents;
b. Develop and implement a process by which individuals can appear in court to seek proportioning of preset fines to their financial ability to pay.
99
5. Develop Effective Ability-to-Pay Assessment System and Improve Data Collection Regarding Imposed Fines
The municipal court should:
a. Develop and implement consistent written criteria for conducting an assessment of an individual’s ability to pay prior to the assessment of any fine, and upon any increase in the fine or related court costs and fees. The ability-to-pay assessment should include not only a consideration of the financial resources of an individual, but also a consideration of any documented fines owed to other municipal courts;
b. Improve current procedures for collecting and tracking data regarding fine amounts imposed. Track initial fines imposed as an independent figure separate from any additional charges imposed during a case;
c. Regularly conduct internal reviews of data regarding fine assessments. This review should include an analysis of fines imposed for the same offenses, including by race of the defendant, to ensure fine assessments for like offenses are set appropriately.
6. Revise Payment Plan Procedures and Provide Alternatives to Fine Payments for Resolving Municipal Charges
The municipal court should:
a. Develop and implement a specific process by which a person can enroll in a payment plan that requires reasonable periodic payments. That process should include an assessment of a person’s ability to pay to determine an appropriate periodic payment amount, although a required payment shall not exceed $100. That process should also include a means for a person to seek a reduction in their monthly payment obligation in the event of a change in their financial circumstances;
b. Provide more opportunities for a person to seek leave to pay a lower amount in a given month beyond the court’s current practice of requiring appearance the first Wednesday of the month at 11:00 a.m. Adopt procedures allowing individuals to seek their first request for a one-time reduction outside of court, and to have such requests be automatically granted. Such procedures should provide that subsequent requests shall be granted liberally by the Municipal Judge, and denials of requests for extensions or reduced monthly payments shall be accompanied by a written explanation of why the request was denied;
c. Cease practice of automatically issuing a warrant when a person on a payment plan misses a payment, and adopt procedures that provide for appropriate warnings following a missed payment, consistent with recommendation eight set forth below;
d. Work with community organizations and other regional groups to develop alternative penalty options besides fines, including expanding community service options. Make all individuals eligible for community service.
7. Reform Trial Procedures to Ensure Full Compliance with Due Process Requirements
The municipal court should take all necessary steps to ensure that the court’s trial procedures fully comport with due process such that defendants are provided with a fair and impartial forum to challenge the charges brought against them. As part of this effort, the court shall ensure that
100
defendants taking their case to trial are provided with all evidence relevant to guilt determinations consistent with the requirements of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), and other applicable law.
8. Stop Using Arrest Warrants as a Means of Collecting Owed Fines and Fees
As Ferguson’s own Municipal Judge has recognized, municipal code violations should result in jail in only the rarest of circumstances. To begin to address these problems, Ferguson should only jail individuals for a failure to appear on or pay a municipal code violation penalty, if at all, if the following steps have been attempted in a particular case and have failed:
a. Enforcement of fines through alternative means, including:
1) Assessment of reasonable late fees;
2) Expanding options for payment through community service;
3) Modified payment plans with reasonable amounts due and payment procedures;
4) A show cause hearing on why a warrant should not issue, including an assessment of ability to pay, where requested. At this hearing the individual has a right to counsel and, if the individual is indigent, the court will assign counsel to represent the individual. See Mo. Sup. Ct. R. 37.65; Mo. Mun. Benchbook, Cir. Ct., Mun. Divs. § 13.8;
b. Personal service on the individual of the Order to Show Cause Motion that provides notice of the above information regarding right to counsel and the consequences of non-appearance; and
c. If the above mechanisms are unsuccessful at securing payment or otherwise resolving the case, the court should ensure that any arrest warrant issued has the instruction that it be executed only on days that the court is in session so that the individual can be brought immediately before the court to enable the above procedures to be implemented. See Mo. Mun. Benchbook, Cir. Ct., Mun. Divs. § 13.8 (“If a defendant fails to appear in court on the return date of the order to show cause or motion for contempt, a warrant should be issued to get the defendant before the court for the hearing.”) (emphasis added).
9. Allow Warrants to be Recalled Without the Payment of Bond
Ferguson recently extended its warrant recall program, also called an “amnesty” program, which allows individuals to have municipal warrants recalled and to receive a new court date without paying a bond. This program should be made permanent. The municipal court should:
a. Allow all individuals to seek warrant recall in writing or via telephone, whether represented by an attorney or not;
b. Provide information to a participating individual at the time of the warrant recall, including the number of charges pending, the fine amount due if a charge has been assessed, the options available to pay assessed fines, the deadlines for doing so, and the requirements, if any, for appearing in court.
101
10. Modify Bond Amounts and Bond and Detention Procedures
Ferguson has two separate municipal code bond schedules and processes: one for warrantless arrests, and another for arrests pursuant to warrants issued by the municipal court. Ferguson’s municipal court recently limited the number of municipal code violations for which officers can jail an individual without a warrant, and reduced the amount of time the jail may hold a defendant who is unable to post bond from 72 to 12 hours. These changes are a positive start, but further reforms are necessary. The City and municipal court should:
a. Limit the amount of time the jail may hold a defendant unable to post bond on all arrests for municipal code violations or municipal arrest warrants to 12 hours;
b. Establish procedures for setting bond amounts for warrantless and warrant-based detainees that are consistent with the Equal Protection Clause’s prohibition on incarcerating individuals on the basis of indigency, and that ensure bond shall in no case exceed $100 for a person arrested pursuant to a municipal warrant, regardless of the number of pending charges;
c. At the time of bond payment, provide individuals with the option of applying a bond fee to underlying fines and costs, including in the event of forfeiture;
d. Take steps necessary, including the continued development of a computerized court records management system as discussed above, to enable court staff, FPD officers, and FPD correctional officers to access case information so that a person has the option of paying the full underlying fine owed in lieu of bond upon being arrested;
e. Increase options for making a bond payment, including allowing bond payment by credit card and through the online payment system, whether by a person in jail or outside of the jail;
f. Institute closer oversight and tracking of bond payment acceptance by FPD officers and FPD correctional officers;
g. Initiate practice of issuing bond refund checks immediately upon a defendant paying their fine in full and being owed a bond refund;
h. Ensure that all court staff, FPD officers, and FPD correctional officers understand Ferguson’s bond rules and procedures.
11. Consistently Provide “Compliance Letters” Necessary for Driver’s License Reinstatement After a Person Makes an Appearance Following a License Suspension
Per official policy, the municipal court provides people who have had their licenses suspended pursuant to Mo. Rev. Stat. § 302.341.1 with compliance letters enabling the suspension to be lifted only once the underlying fine has been paid in full. Court staff told us, however, that in “sympathetic cases,” they provide compliance letters that enable people to have their licenses reinstated. The court should adopt and implement a policy of providing individuals with compliance letters immediately upon a person appearing in court following a license suspension pursuant to this statute.
102
12. Close Cases that Remain on the Court’s Docket Solely Because of Failure to Appear Charges or Bond Forfeitures
In September 2014, the City of Ferguson repealed Ferguson Mun. Code § 13-58, which allowed the imposition of an additional “Failure to Appear” charge, fines, and fees in response to missed appearances and payments. Nonetheless, many cases remain pending on the court’s docket solely on account of charges, fines, and fees issued pursuant to this statute or because of questionable bond forfeiture practices. The City and municipal court should:
a. Close all municipal cases in which the individual has paid fines equal or greater to the amount of the fine assessed for the original municipal code violation—through Failure to Appear fines and fees or forfeited bond payments—and clear all associated warrants;
b. Remove all Failure to Appear related charges, fines, and fees from current cases, and close all cases in which only a Failure to Appear charge, fine, or fee remains pending;
c. Immediately provide compliance letters so that license suspensions are lifted for all individuals whose cases are closed pursuant to these reforms.
13. Collaborate with Other Municipalities and the State of Missouri to Implement Reforms
These recommendations should be closely evaluated and, as appropriate, implemented by other municipalities. We also recommend that the City and other municipalities work collaboratively with the state of Missouri on issues requiring statewide action, and further recommend:
a. Reform of Mo. Rev. Stat. § 302.341.1, which requires the suspension of individuals’ driving licenses in certain cases where they do not appear or timely pay traffic charges involving moving violations;
b. Increased oversight of municipal courts in St. Louis County and throughout the state of Missouri to ensure that courts operate in a manner consistent with due process, equal protection, and other requirements of the Constitution and other laws.
VI. CONCLUSION
Our investigation indicates that Ferguson as a City has the capacity to reform its approach to law enforcement. A small municipal department may offer greater potential for officers to form partnerships and have frequent, positive interactions with Ferguson residents, repairing and maintaining police-community relationships. See, e.g., Jim Burack, Putting the “Local” Back in Local Law Enforcement, in, American Policing in 2022: Essays on the Future of the Profession 79-83 (Debra R. Cohen McCullough & Deborah L. Spence, eds., 2012). These reform efforts will be well worth the considerable time and dedication they will require, as they have the potential to make Ferguson safer and more united."

A dope mayn just like me
I like to front the world some coke
And let them sell for me
Born in the ghetto as a street thug
At age 16 I started sellin cheap drugs
Extacy will cost you three
A year later I robbed a dope house and stole a ki
36 is what I count
Now multiply 36 with 700 a ounce
Bag it up and make my profit
But some pussy muthafucka in offices tryin to stop it

And the bastard that's stoppin the bus
Is the same muthafucka that delivers to us
He's payin off the cops
Triple-crossin the middle man tryin to give the smaller pusher power

The politicians are players
Reagan and Bush were cuttin tough on Noriega
Now the juices are sour
Remember politician means schemin for power
(You know what a chazzer is?
That's a pig that don't fly straight) -- Tony Montana

Now let's go back to the past
The motherfucker who needs to be tried is Ronald Reagan's ass
Appointed Bush to the C.I.A
(That shit was cold
Put Noriega on the payroll)
All of a sudden shit changed
Right after '88 (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Hm - ain't that strange?
Some think I'm goin too far
But if you wanna go to war, I take you to war

They don't care about niggas on welfare
As long as their kind ain't there

You've got my ki's on a freeze
Muthafucka, my city's under siege
(Today's special
Is ghetto dope)
Willie D sell out, you can squash that fast
Here's a hit and a half for your ass
Police brutality is now a formality
They're kickin our ass and we're payin their salary

The average cop with a badge is a bitch
Back in high school they used to get their fuckin ass kicked
All of a sudden they're snappin necks
Puttin niggas in check, makin threats, sayin I'm next

I laugh at a muthafuckin law man
Without the piece, bitch, you're nothin but a raw man
You couldn't hang if you were cappin or punchin
(So go suck a dick and write or ticket or somethin)

Can't understand my city's under siege
Still the Ak be clockin' g's
Got a Coupe De Ville, got a rag and ridin '83s
Copper wanna play the Ak
Guess they think I'm slangin' crack
Motherfuck the 50s, they can't stop me, got my corner back
Rocks and rocks and rocks galore
I left the cut and then I swore
Never be a stupid ass, I'll never leave the cut no more
The dope game ain't no joke
Muthafuckas will die for this, they go for broke
Rock houses open and busted
And the bitch that got you busted
(Was the bitch that you trusted)
Pimp on me, and I'll make bail
Hunt you down and kick your ass through the goal post of hell
(Are you lighter on a female figure?)
Hell nah, I fuck her up just like I fuck up a nigga
Red, grab the pump (Bill, pass me my nine
Now tell em what's on your mind)

You goddamn parents are a trip
The streets got your babies cause you're full of that bullshit
You tell your kids drugs'll fuck up their health
And you're geekin your goddamn self
But I won't blame it all on you
You stupid-ass teachers can suck my dick too
I walk around with a smirk
Fuck school, fuck curfew, fuck homework
And muthafuck a damn cop
I never ride down my block without my gun bein cocked
You won't get a chance to slay me
I won't be an accident like Ida Delaney
So when you step out of line
(*shots*) I'm goin for mine
D.O.A. is how they pronounce you
No suspect, no motive, no clue
When you hoes say 'stop', I be damned if I freeze
I truly believe my city's under siege

Habol’ ako sila sila’t ako walong sumpa

Na nakapaloob sa pagkamabalasik imprehensibong lumuwa

Kaya sa mga kabataan marami na ang tanga
Mga sabik na sabik magpakita sa madla
Ng kanilang mga selfieng naka T-Back lang at bra
Gustong-gusto niya na masabihang maganda
Ng mga kalalakihang naglalakihan ang mata
‘Pagkat halos lahat, nais siya makana
Kaka-gluta amputi na, daig pa ang kana
Marami-rami na rin siyang mga sinamantala
Mga parokyano niya na nakapila sa kanya
Mapapatanong ka na lang ng teh tigasan ka
Lalo na kapag nakapitan ka na niya
‘Pag tinitigan mo siya malapitan sa mata
Magugulat ka sa fb lang pala siya maganda
Ikaw na ‘yan nuon pa man mula nang pinanganak ka
‘Di ka liberated, malandi ka talaga

Para lang makabili ng mga gamit
Ikaw ay walang kaba na magpagamit
Kung kani-kanino ka na lumalapit
Kahit na kaninong patalim ay kumakapit
Kasi, malandi malandi malandi ka
Kasi, malandi malandi malandi ka
Mapipe mapipe mapipera
Nakapi nakapi nakapila
Gawa ilong, gawa suso kasi ‘yan daw ang uso
Ang dami-dami niyo na ‘langhiya nakakabobo
Magpo-photoshoot, pero puro photoshop
Famewhore ng instagram nanlilimos ng double tap
Yayayain, si lolo na magcheck inn tapos sex
Matik na ang kapalit nun iPhone X
Sabay selfie nya sa CPng laging bago bes
Tapos hashtag “feeling lucky I’m so blessed”

Ano ba ‘yan teh
‘Di mo ba sila kaya na lubayan teh
‘Di ka ba nagsasawang hubaran teh
Sariling sikap ‘di ba kayang umabante
Kapag may bago gusto laging sumabay eh
Wala ka ngang trabaho sobra mo pang arte
Naka-2 piece nagsi-selfie sa hotel na mag-isa
Habang yung sponky niya nasa kubeta lang pala what

Para lang makabili ng mga gamit
Ikaw ay walang kaba na magpagamit
Kung kani-kanino ka na lumalapit
Kahit na kaninong patalim ay kumakapit
Kasi, malandi malandi malandi ka
Kasi, malandi malandi malandi ka
Mapipe mapipe mapipera
Nakapi nakapi nakapila
Mga short mo literal na pekpek short
‘Pag nabastos sa facebook magre-report
Natripan lang naman nila sexy pic mo
Sanay ka naman kunwari pang sensitive ‘toh
Kita pwet post galit ‘pag nabastos
Binastos daw ang pic nya na labas sows
Sorry naman matino ka pala
Ah mali yung tanong “matino ka pa ba”
Kung tinamaan ka ibig sabihin ganto ka
Malalaman ko ‘yan kapag sa akin nagtampo ka
Ano man ang narinig mo ‘di ka dapat masaktan
Lalo na kung alam mo naman ‘di ka naman ganyan
‘Di ako yung tipong rapper na sabik sa uso
Puro tungkol dun ang kanta para in sa uso
Sapul ang nasa gitna pati ang nasa gedli
Kung tinamaan ka pasensya ka na bestie"

Kilalanin ang 'yong sarili
(Now you know! Now you know!)

Pagkagising sa umaga, naghanap ng aliw
Tas pasado alas dos, nag tunaw at nag chill
At nung umabot sa peak, sinundan pa ng deew
At nagbago ang mundo, para na akong baliw
Ugh, ugh para ng baliw
Ugh, ugh para ng baliw
Ugh, ugh para ng baliw
Pagkasapit ng gabi, tumambay at tumagay ng beer

Ang pahinang makapal pa sa sweldo
Ang kamalayang mas mahalaga sa peso
Niligaw sa oras, tinakpan ang Seiko
Bawat nilakaran, ginawang museo
Para ng nagiging dagat, nung sisirin aking lawak
At nung di na ko magets, bat baliw agad ang tawag
At madalas pang mapagkamalang tus
Kung baliw tingin niyo sakin, ano tawag kay Hesus
Sandali, sandali, baka di na mapakali
Baka masaktan pa ang ego ng mga makasarili
Bawal ba? Bawal alin? Kaya lang bawal kasi
Para matakot sa kung ano ang kaya mong gawin
(Now you know!)
Ang ibig ko lang naman sabihin
(Now you know!)
Wag ka lang magpapa alipin

Kung si Don Angelo yung tipo ng rapper na gigising sa inyo
Edi ako nang bahala na magbawas ng kayabangan niyo

Fake it 'til You make it I don't know why you people can take it
Birds with the same feather flocks together that's why can't get Any better

Off track, but yet we stay on course

See, I don’t go to the bother of getting a lottery
Ticket that often, so when I do, I wanna win right
Wear my clothes baggy but the flows skin tight
A collector, with one eye out for insight
I got the arsenal to indict or invite
C'mon take a hit from the windpipe I’m inflight
The way I move even sitting still
See I could channel Cube but instead chill at will
In a town full of flag waving Blinky Bills
Just trying to ink a deal, they don’t collab they do dinner deals
I’d recommend it if you keep it sealed
Don’t worry we’ll return it you just watch the steering wheel

109,99295644,PML (Panghawakan Mo Lang) (Minus One),Smugglaz,[18],['Hip Hop/Rap'],"We are accustomed to see poets principally occupied with describing the love of the sexes. This, as a rule, is the leading idea of every dramatic work, be it tragic or comic, romantic or classic, Indian or European. It in no less degree constitutes the greater part of both lyric and epic poetry, especially if in these we Include the host of romances which have been produced every year for centuries in every civilised country in Europe as regularly as the fruits of the earth. All these works are nothing more than many-sided, short, or long descriptions of the passion in question. Moreover, the most successful delineations of love, such,
For example, as Romeo and Juliet, La Nouvelle Héloise, and Werther, have attained immortal fame. Rochefoucauld says that love may be compared to a ghost since it is something we talk about but have never seen, and Lichtenberg, in his essay Ueber die Macht der Liebe, disputes and denies its reality and
Naturalness—but both are in the wrong. For if it were foreign to and contradicted human nature—in other words, if it were merely an imaginary caricature, it would not have been depicted with such zeal by the poets of all ages, or accepted by mankind with an unaltered interest; for anything artistically beautiful cannot exist without truth.
“Rien n’est beau que le vrai; le vrai seul est aimable.”—BOIL.
Experience, although not that of everyday, verifies that that which as a rule begins only as a strong and yet controllable inclination, may develop, under certain conditions, into a passion, the ardour of which surpasses that of every other. It will ignore all considerations, overcome all kinds of obstacles with incredible strength and persistence. A man, in order to have his love gratified, will unhesitatingly risk his life; in fact, if his love is absolutely rejected, he will sacrifice his life into the bargain. The Werthers and Jacopo Ortis do not only exist in romances; Europe produces every year at least half-a-dozen like them: Sed ignotis perierunt mortibus illi: for their sufferings are chronicled by the writer of official registers or by the reporters of newspapers. Indeed, readers of the police news in English and French newspapers will confirm what I have said.
Love drives a still greater number of people into the lunatic asylum. There is a case of some sort every year of two lovers committing suicide together because material circumstances happen to be unfavourable to their union. By the way, I cannot understand how it is that such people, who are confident of each
Other’s love, and expect to find their greatest happiness in the enjoyment of it, do not avoid taking extreme steps, and prefer suffering every discomfort to sacrificing with their lives a happiness which is greater than any other they can conceive. As far as lesser phases and passages of love are concerned, all of us have them daily before our eyes, and, if we are not old, the most of us in our hearts.
After what has been brought to mind, one cannot doubt either the reality or importance of love. Instead, therefore, of wondering why a philosopher for once in a way writes on this subject, which has been constantly the theme of poets, rather should one be surprised that love, which always plays such an important rôle in a man’s life, has scarcely ever been considered at all by philosophers, and that it still stands as material for them to make use of.
Plato has devoted himself more than any one else to the subject of love, especially in the Symposium and The Phaedrus; what he has said about it, however, comes within the sphere of myth, fable, and raillery, and only applies for the most part to the love of a Greek youth. The little that Rousseau says in his Discours sur l’inégalité is neither true nor satisfactory. Kant’s disquisition on love in the third part of his treatise, Ueber Das Gefühl des Schönen und Erhabenen, is very superficial; it shows that he has not thoroughly gone into the subject, and therefore it is somewhat untrue. Finally, Platner’s treatment of it in his Anthropology will be found by every one to be insipid and shallow. To amuse the reader, on the other hand, Spinoza’s definition deserves to be quoted because of its exuberant naïveté: Amor est titillatio, concomitante idea causae externae (Eth. iv., prop. 44). It is not my intention to be either influenced or to contradict what has been written by my predecessors; the subject has forced itself upon me objectively, and has of itself become inseparable from my consideration of the world. Moreover, I shall expect least approval from those people who are for the moment enchained by this passion, and in consequence try to express their exuberant feelings in the most sublime and ethereal images. My view will seem to them too physical, too material, however metaphysical, nay, transcendent it is fundamentally.
First of all let them take into consideration that the creature whom they are idealising to-day in madrigals and sonnets would have been ignored almost entirely by them if she had been born eighteen years previously.
Every kind of love, however ethereal it may seem to be, springs entirely from the instinct of sex; indeed, it is absolutely this instinct, only in a more definite, specialised, and perhaps, strictly speaking, more individualised form. If, bearing this in mind, one considers the important rôle which love plays in all its phases
And degrees, not only in dramas and novels, but also in the real world, where next to one’s love of life it shows itself as the strongest and most active of all motives; if one considers that it constantly occupies half the capacities and thoughts of the younger part of humanity, and is the final goal of almost every human effort; that it influences adversely the most important affairs; that it hourly disturbs the most earnest occupations; that it sometimes deranges even the greatest intellects for a time; that it is not afraid of interrupting the transactions of statesmen or the investigations of men of learning; that it knows how to leave its love-letters and locks of hair in ministerial portfolios and philosophical manuscripts; that it knows equally well how to plan the most complicated and wicked affairs, to dissolve the most important relations, to break the strongest ties; that life, health, riches, rank, and happiness are sometimes sacrificed for its sake; that it makes the otherwise honest, perfidious, and a man who has been hitherto faithful a betrayer, and, altogether, appears as a hostile demon whose object is to overthrow, confuse, and upset everything it comes across: if all this is taken into consideration one will have reason to ask—“Why is there all this noise? Why all this crowding, blustering, anguish, and want? Why should such a trifle play so important a part and create disturbance and confusion in the well-regulated life of mankind?” But to the earnest investigator the spirit of truth gradually unfolds the answer: it is not a trifle one is dealing with; the importance of love is absolutely in keeping with the seriousness and zeal with which it is prosecuted. The ultimate aim of all love-affairs, whether they be of a tragic or comic nature, is really more important than all other aims in human life, and therefore is perfectly deserving of that profound seriousness with which it is pursued.
As a matter of fact, love determines nothing less than the establishment of the next generation. The existence and nature of the dramatis personae who come on to the scene when we have made our exit have been determined by some frivolous love-affair. As the being, the existentia of these future people is conditioned by our instinct of sex in general, so is the nature, the essentia, of these same people conditioned by the selection that the individual makes for his satisfaction, that is to say, by love, and is thereby in every respect irrevocably established. This is the key of the problem. In applying it, we shall understand it more fully if we analyse the various degrees of love, from the most fleeting sensation to the most ardent passion; we shall then see that the difference arises from the degree of individualisation of the choice. All the loveaffairs of the present generation taken altogether are accordingly the meditatio compositionis generationis futurae, e qua iterum pendent innumerae generationes of mankind. Love is of such high import, because it has nothing to do with the weal or woe of the present individual, as every other matter has; it has to secure the existence and special nature of the human race in future times; hence the will of the individual appears in a higher aspect as the will of the species; and this it is that gives a pathetic and sublime import to love-affairs, and makes their raptures and troubles transcendent, emotions which poets for centuries have not tired of depicting in a variety of ways. There is no subject that can rouse the same interest as love, since it concerns both the weal and woe of the species, and is related to every other which only concerns the welfare of the individual as body to surface.
This is why it is so difficult to make a drama interesting if it possesses no love motive; on the other hand, the subject is never exhausted, although it is constantly being utilised.
What manifests itself in the individual consciousness as instinct of sex in general, without being concentrated on any particular individual, is very plainly in itself, in its generalised form, the will to live. On the other hand, that which appears as instinct of sex directed to a certain individual, is in itself the will to live as a definitely determined individual. In this case the instinct of sex very cleverly wears the mask of objective admiration, although in itself it is a subjective necessity, and is, thereby, deceptive. Nature needs these stratagems in order to accomplish her ends. The purpose of every man in love, however objective and sublime his admiration may appear to be, is to beget a being of a definite nature, and that this is so, is verified by the fact that it is not mutual love but possession that is the essential. Without possession it is no consolation to a man to know that his love is requited. In fact, many a man has shot himself on finding himself in such a position. On the other hand, take a man who is very much in love; if he cannot have his love returned he is content simply with possession. Compulsory marriages and cases of seduction corroborate this, for a man whose love is not returned frequently finds consolation in giving handsome presents to a woman, in spite of her dislike, or making other sacrifices, so that he may buy her favour.
The real aim of the whole of love’s romance, although the persons concerned are unconscious of the fact, is that a particular being may come into the world; and the way and manner in which it is accomplished is a secondary consideration. However much those of lofty sentiments, and especially of those in love, may refute the gross realism of my argument, they are nevertheless in the wrong. For is not the aim of definitely determining the individualities of the next generation a much higher and nobler aim than that other, with its exuberant sensations and transcendental soap-bubbles? Among all earthly aims is there one that is either more important or greater? It alone is in keeping with that deep-rooted feeling inseparable from passionate love, with that earnestness with which it appears, and the importance which it attaches to the trifles that come within its sphere. It is only in so far as we regard this end as the real one that the difficulties encountered, the endless troubles and vexations endured, in order to attain the object we love, appear to be in keeping with the matter. For it is the future generation in its entire individual determination which forces itself into existence through the medium of all this strife and trouble. Indeed, the future generation itself is already stirring in the careful, definite, and apparently capricious selection for the satisfaction of the instinct of sex which we call love. That growing affection of two lovers for each other is in reality the
Will to live of the new being, of which they shall become the parents; indeed, in the meeting of their yearning glances the life of a new being is kindled, and manifests itself as a well-organised individuality of the future. The lovers have a longing to be really united and made one being, and to live as such for the rest of their lives; and this longing is fulfilled in the children born to them, in whom the qualities inherited from both, but combined and united in one being, are perpetuated. Contrarily, if a man and woman mutually, persistently, and decidedly dislike each other, it indicates that they could only bring into the world a badly
Organised, discordant, and unhappy being. Therefore much must be attached to Calderon’s words, when he calls the horrible Semiramis a daughter of the air, yet introduces her as a daughter of seduction, after which follows the murder of the husband.
Finally, it is the will to live presenting itself in the whole species, which so forcibly and exclusively attracts two individuals of different sex towards each other. This will anticipates in the being, of which they shall become the parents, an objectivation of its nature corresponding to its aims. This individual will
Inherit the father’s will and character, the mother’s intellect, and the constitution of both. As a rule, however, an individual takes more after the father in shape and the mother in stature, corresponding to the law which applies to the offspring of animals.... It is impossible to explain the individuality of each man, which is quite exceptional and peculiar to him alone; and it is just as impossible to explain the passion of two people for each other, for it is equally individual and uncommon in character; indeed, fundamentally both are one and the same. The former is explicite what the latter was implicite. We must consider as the origin of a new individual and true punctum saliens of its life the moment
When the parents begin to love each other—to fancy each other, as the English appropriately express it.
And, as has been said, in the meeting of their longing glances originates the first germ of a new being, which, indeed, like all germs, is generally crushed out. This new individual is to a certain extent a new (Platonic) Idea; now, as all Ideas strive with the greatest vehemence to enter the phenomenal sphere, and
To do this, ardently seize upon the matter which the law of causality distributes among them all, so this particular Idea of a human individuality struggles with the greatest eagerness and vehemence for its realisation in the phenomenal. It is precisely this vehement desire which is the passion of the future parents
For one another. Love has countless degrees, and its two extremes may be indicated as  and ; nevertheless, in essentials it is the same everywhere.
According to the degree, on the other hand, it will be the more powerful the more individualised it is—that is to say, the more the loved individual, by virtue of all her qualities, is exclusively fit to satisfy the lover’s desire and needs determined by her own individuality. If we investigate further we shall understand
More clearly what this involves. All amorous feeling immediately and essentially concentrates itself on health, strength, and beauty, and consequently on youth; because the will above all wishes to exhibit the specific character of the human species as the basis of all individuality. The same applies pretty well to everyday courtship (). With this are bound up more special requirements, which we will consider individually later on, and with which, if there is any prospect of gratification, there is an increase of passion. Intense love, however, springs from a fitness of both individualities for each other; so that the will, that is to say the father’s character and the mother’s intellect combined, exactly complete that individual for which the will to live in general (which exhibits itself in the whole species) has a longing—a longing proportionate to this its greatness, and therefore surpassing the measure of a mortal heart; its motives being in a like manner beyond the sphere of the individual intellect. This, then, is the soul of a really great passion. The more perfectly two individuals are fitted for each other in the various respects
Which we shall consider further on, the stronger will be their passion for each other. As there are not two individuals exactly alike, a particular kind of woman must perfectly correspond with a particular kind of man—always in view of the child that is to be born. Real, passionate love is as rare as the meeting of two
People exactly fitted for each other. By the way, it is because there is a possibility of real passionate love in us all that we understand why poets have depicted it in their works.
Because the kernel of passionate love turns on the anticipation of the child to be born and its nature, it is quite possible for friendship, without any admixture of sexual love, to exist between two young, goodlooking people of different sex, if there is perfect fitness of temperament and intellectual capacity. In fact, a certain aversion for each other may exist also. The reason of this is that a child begotten by them would physically or mentally have discordant qualities. In short, the child’s existence and nature would not be in narmony with the purposes of the will to live as it presents itself in the species.
In an opposite case, where there is no fitness of disposition, character, and mental capacity, whereby aversion, nay, even enmity for each other exists, it is possible for love to spring up. Love of this kind makes them blind to everything; and if it leads to marriage it is a very unhappy one.
And now let us more thoroughly investigate the matter. Egoism is a quality so deeply rooted in every personality that it is on egotistical ends only that one may safely rely in order to rouse the individual to activity.
To be sure, the species has a prior, nearer, and greater claim on the individual than the transient individuality itself; and yet even when the individual makes some sort of conscious sacrifice for the perpetuation and future of the species, the importance of the matter will not be made sufficiently comprehensible to his intellect, which is mainly constituted to regard individual ends.
Therefore Nature attains her ends by implanting in the individual a certain illusion by which something which is in reality advantageous to the species alone seems to be advantageous to himself; consequently he serves the latter while he imagines he is serving himself. In this process he is carried away by a mere
Chimera, which floats before him and vanishes again immediately, and as a motive takes the place of reality. This illusion is instinct. In most instances instinct may be regarded as the sense of the species which presents to the will whatever is of service to the species. But because the will has here become individual it must be deceived in such a manner for it to discern by the sense of the individual what the sense of the species has presented to it; in other words, imagine it is pursuing ends concerning the individual, when in reality it is pursuing merely general ends (using the word general in its strictest sense).
Outward manifestation of instinct can be best observed in animals, where the part it plays is most significant; but it is in ourselves alone that we can get to know its internal process, as of everything internal. It is true, it is thought that man has scarcely any instinct at all, or at any rate has only sufficient instinct when he is born to seek and take his mother’s breast. But as a matter of fact man has a very decided, clear, and yet complicated instinct—namely, for the selection, both earnest and capricious, of another individual, to
Satisfy his instinct of sex. The beauty or ugliness of the other individual has nothing whatever to do with this satisfaction in itself, that is in so far as it is a matter of pleasure based upon a pressing desire of the individual. The regard, however, for this satisfaction, which is so zealously pursued, as well as the careful
Selection it entails, has obviously nothing to do with the chooser himself, although he fancies that it has. Its real aim is the child to be born, in whom the type of the species is to be preserved in as pure and perfect a form as possible. For instance, different phases of degeneration of the human form are the consequences of a thousand physical accidents and moral delinquencies; and yet the genuine type of the human form is, in all its parts, always restored; further, this is accomplished under the guidance of the sense of beauty, which universally directs the instinct of sex, and without which the satisfaction of the latter would deteriorate to a repulsive necessity.
Accordingly, every one in the first place will infinitely prefer and ardently desire those who are most beautiful—in other words, those in whom the character of the species is most purely defined; and in the second, every one will desire in the other individual those perfections which he himself lacks, and he will consider imperfections, which are the reverse of his own, beautiful. This is why little men prefer big women, and fair people like dark, and so on. The ecstasy with which a man is filled at the sight of a beautiful woman, making him imagine that union with her will be the greatest happiness, is simply the sense of the species. The preservation of the type of the species rests on this distinct preference for beauty, and this is why beauty has such power.
We will later on more fully state the considerations which this involves. It is really instinct aiming at what is best in the species which induces a man to choose a beautiful woman, although the man himself imagines that by so doing he is only seeking to increase his own pleasure. As a matter of fact, we have here an instructive solution of the secret nature of all instinct which almost always, as in this case, prompts the individual to look after the welfare of the species. The care with which an insect selects a certain flower or fruit, or piece of flesh, or the way in which the ichneumon seeks the larva of a strange insect so that it may lay its eggs in that particular place only, and to secure which it fears neither labour nor danger, is obviously very analogous to the care with which a man chooses a woman of a definite nature individually suited to him. He strives for her with such ardour that he frequently, in order to attain his object, will sacrifice his happiness in life, in spite of all reason, by a foolish marriage, by some love-affair which costs him his fortune, honour, and life, even by committing crimes. And all this in accordance with the will of nature which is everywhere sovereign, so that he may serve the species in the most efficient manner, although he does so at the expense of the individual.
Instinct everywhere works as with the conception of an end, and yet it is entirely without one. Nature implants instinct where the acting individual is not capable of understanding the end, or would be unwilling to pursue it. Consequently, as a rule, it is only given prominently to animals, and in particular to those of the lowest order, which have the least intelligence. But it is only in such a case as the one we are at present considering that it is also given to man, who naturally is capable of understanding the end, but would not pursue it with the necessary zeal—that is to say, he would not pursue it at the cost of his individual welfare. So that here, as in all cases of instinct, truth takes the form of illusion in order to influence the will….
All this, however, on its part throws light upon the instinct of animals. They, too, are undoubtedly carried away by a kind of illusion, which represents that they are working for their own pleasure, while it is for the species that they are working with such industry and self-denial. The bird builds its nest; the insect seeks a suitable place wherein to lay its eggs, or even hunts for prey, which it dislikes itself, but which must be placed beside the eggs as food for the future larvae; the bee, the wasp, and the ant apply themselves to their skilful building and extremely complex economy. All of them are undoubtedly controlled by an illusion which conceals the service of the species under the mask of an egotistical purpose.
This is probably the only way in which to make the inner or subjective process, from which spring all manifestations of instinct, intelligible to us. The outer or objective process, however, shows in animals strongly controlled by instinct, as insects for instance, a preponderance of the ganglion—i.e., subjective nervous system over the objective or cerebral system. From which it may be concluded that they are controlled not so much by objective and proper apprehension as by subjective ideas, which excite desire and arise through the influence of the ganglionic system upon the brain; accordingly they are moved by a certain illusion….
The great preponderance of brain in man accounts for his having fewer instincts than the lower order of animals, and for even these few easily being led astray. For instance, the sense of beauty which instinctively guides a man in his selection of a mate is misguided when it degenerates into the proneness to pederasty. Similarly, the blue-bottle (Musca vomitoria), which instinctively ought to place its eggs in putrified flesh, lays them in the blossom of the Arum dracunculus, because it is misled by the decaying odour of this plant. That an absolutely generic instinct is the foundation of all love of sex may be confirmed by a closer analysis of the subject—an analysis which can hardly be avoided.
In the first place, a man in love is by nature inclined to be inconstant, while a woman constant. A man's love perceptibly decreases after a certain period; almost every other woman charms him more than the one he already possesses; he longs for change: while a woman's love increases from the very moment it is returned. This is because nature aims at the preservation of the species, and consequently at as great an increase in it as possible…. This is why a man is always desiring other women, while a woman always clings to one man; for nature compels her intuitively and unconsciously to take care of the supporter and protector of the future offspring. For this reason conjugal fidelity is artificial with the man but natural to a woman. Hence a woman's infidelity, looked at objectively on account of the consequences, and subjectively on account of its unnaturalness, is much more unpardonable than a man's.
In order to be quite clear and perfectly convinced that the delight we take in the other sex, however objective it may seem to be, is nevertheless merely instinct disguised, in other words, the sense of the species striving to preserve its type, it will be necessary to investigate more closely the considerations which influence us in this, and go into details, strange as it may seem for these details to figure in a philosophical work. These considerations may be classed in the following way:—
Those that immediately concern the type of the species, id est, beauty; those that concern other physical qualities; and finally, those that are merely relative and spring from the necessary correction or neutralisation of the one-sided qualities and abnormities of the two individuals by each other. Let us look at these considerations separately.
The first consideration that influences our choice and feelings is age….
The second consideration is that of health: a severe illness may alarm us for the time being, but an illness of a chronic nature or even cachexy frightens us away, because it would be transmitted.
The third consideration is the skeleton, since it is the foundation of the type of the species. Next to old age and disease, nothing disgusts us so much as a deformed shape; even the most beautiful face cannot make amends for it—in fact, the ugliest face combined with a well-grown shape is infinitely preferable. Moreover, we are most keenly sensible of every malformation of the skeleton; as, for instance, a stunted, short-legged form, and the like, or a limping gait when it is not the result of some extraneous accident: while a conspicuously beautiful figure compensates for every defect. It delights us. Further, the great importance which is attached to small feet! This is because the size of the foot is an essential characteristic of the species, for no animal has the tarsus and metatarsus combined so small as man; hence the uprightness of his gait: he is a plantigrade. And Jesus Sirach has said (according to the improved translation by Kraus), ""A woman that is well grown and has beautiful feet is like pillars of gold in sockets of silver."" The teeth, too, are important, because they are essential for nourishment, and quite peculiarly hereditary.
The fourth consideration is a certain plumpness, in other words, a superabundance of the vegetative function, plasticity…. Hence excessive thinness strikingly repels us…. The last consideration that influences us is a beautiful face. Here, too, the bone parts are taken into account before everything else. So that almost everything depends on a beautiful nose, while a short retroussé one will mar all. A slight upward or downward turn of the nose has often determined the life's happiness of a great many maidens; and justly so, for the type of the species is at stake.
A small mouth, by means of small maxillae, is very essential, as it is the specific characteristic of the human face as distinguished from the muzzle of the brutes. A receding, as it were, a cut-away chin is particularly repellent, because mentum prominulum is a characteristic belonging exclusively to our species.
Finally, we come to the consideration of beautiful eyes and a beautiful forehead; they depend upon the psychical qualities, and in particular, the intellectual, which are inherited from the mother. The unconscious considerations which, on the other hand, influence women in their choice naturally cannot be so accurately specified. In general, we may say the following:—That the age they prefer is from thirty to thirty-five. For instance, they prefer men of this age to youths, who in reality possess the highest form of human beauty. The reason for this is that they are not guided by taste but by instinct, which recognises in this particular age the acme of generative power. In general, women pay little attention to beauty, that is, to beauty of face; they seem to take it upon themselves alone to endow the child with beauty. It is chiefly the strength of a man and the courage that goes with it that attract them, for both of these promise the generation of robust children and at the same time a brave protector for them. Every physical defect in a man, any deviation from the type, a woman may, with regard to the child, eradicate if she is faultless in these parts herself or excels in a contrary direction. The only exceptions are those qualities which are peculiar to the man, and which, in consequence, a mother cannot bestow on her child; these include the masculine build of the skeleton, breadth of shoulder, small hips, straight legs, strength of muscle, courage, beard, and so on. And so it happens that a woman frequently loves an ugly man, albeit she never loves an unmanly man, because she cannot neutralise his defects.
The second class of considerations that are the source of love are those depending on the psychical qualities. Here we shall find that a woman universally is attracted by the qualities of a man's heart or character, both of which are inherited from the father. It is mainly firmness of will, determination and courage, and may be honesty and goodness of heart too, that win a woman over; while intellectual qualifications exercise no direct or instinctive power over her, for the simple reason that these are not inherited from the father. A lack of intelligence carries no weight with her; in fact, a superabundance of mental power or even genius, as abnormities, might have an unfavourable effect. And so we frequently find a woman preferring a stupid, ugly, and ill-mannered man to one who is well-educated, intellectual, and agreeable. Hence, people of extremely different temperament frequently marry for love—that is to say, he is coarse, strong, and narrow-minded, while she is very sensitive, refined, cultured, and aesthetic, and so on; or he is genial and clever, and she is a goose.
""Sic visum Veneri; cui placet impares
Formas atque animos sub juga aënea
Saevo mittere cum joco.""
The reason for this is, that she is not influenced by intellectual considerations, but by something entirely different, namely, instinct. Marriage is not regarded as a means for intellectual entertainment, but for the generation of children; it is a union of hearts and not of minds. When a woman says that she has fallen in love with a man's mind, it is either a vain and ridiculous pretence on her part or the exaggeration of a degenerate being. A man, on the other hand, is not controlled in instinctive love by the qualities of the woman's character; this is why so many a Socrates has found his Xantippe, as for instance, Shakespeare, Albrecht Dürer, Byron, and others. But here we have the influence of intellectual qualities, because they are inherited from the mother; nevertheless their influence is easily overpowered by physical beauty, which concerns more essential points, and therefore has a more direct effect. By the way, it is for this reason that mothers who have either felt or experienced the former influence have their daughters taught the fine arts, languages, etc., so that they may prove more attractive. In this way they hope by artificial means to pad the intellect, just as they do their bust and hips if it is necessary to do so. Let it be understood that here we are simply speaking of that attraction which is absolutely direct and instinctive, and from which springs real love. That an intelligent and educated woman esteems intelligence and brains in a man, and that a man after deliberate reasoning criticises and considers the character of his fianceé, are matters which do not concern our present subject. Such things influence a rational selection in marriage, but they do not control passionate love, which is our matter.
Up to the present I have taken into consideration merely the absolute considerations—id est, such considerations as apply to every one. I now come to the relative considerations, which are individual, because they aim at rectifying the type of the species which is defectively presented and at correcting any deviation from it existing in the person of the chooser himself, and in this way lead back to a pure presentation of the type. Hence each man loves what he himself is deficient in. The choice that is based on relative considerations—that is, has in view the constitution of the individual—is much more certain, decided, and exclusive than the choice that is made after merely absolute considerations; consequently real passionate love will have its origin, as a rule, in these relative considerations, and it will only be the ordinary phases of love that spring from the absolute. So that it is not stereotyped, perfectly beautiful women who are wont to kindle great passions. Before a truly passionate feeling can exist, something is necessary that is perhaps best expressed by a metaphor in chemistry—namely, the two persons must neutralise each other, like acid and alkali to a neutral salt. Before this can be done the following conditions are essential. In the first place, all sexuality is one-sided. This one-sidedness is more definitely expressed and exists in a higher degree in one person than in another; so that it may be better supplemented and neutralised in each individual by one person than by another of the opposite sex, because the individual requires a one-sidedness opposite to his own in order to complete the type of humanity in the new individual to be generated, to the constitution of which everything tends….
The following is necessary for this neutralisation of which we are speaking. The particular degree of his manhood must exactly correspond to the particular degree of her womanhood in order to exactly balance the one-sidedness of each. Hence the most manly man will desire the most womanly woman, and vice versâ, and so each will want the individual that exactly corresponds to him in degree of sex. Inasmuch as two persons fulfil this necessary relation towards each other, it is instinctively felt by them and is the origin, together with the other relative considerations, of the higher degrees of love. While, therefore, two lovers are pathetically talking about the harmony of their souls, the kernel of the conversation is for the most part the harmony concerning the individual and its perfection, which obviously is of much more importance than the harmony of their souls—which frequently turns out to be a violent discord shortly after marriage.
We now come to those other relative considerations which depend on each individual trying to eradicate, through the medium of another, his weaknesses, deficiencies, and deviations from the type, in order that they may not be perpetuated in the child that is to be born or develop into absolute abnormities. The weaker a man is in muscular power, the more will he desire a woman who is muscular; and the same thing applies to a woman….
Nevertheless, if a big woman choose a big husband, in order, perhaps, to present a better appearance in society, the children, as a rule, suffer for her folly. Again, another very decided consideration is complexion. Blonde people fancy either absolutely dark complexions or brown; but it is rarely the case vice versâ. The reason for it is this: that fair hair and blue eyes are a deviation from the type and almost constitute an abnormity, analogous to white mice, or at any rate white horses. They are not indigenous to any other part of the world but Europe,—not even to the polar regions,—and are obviously of Scandinavian origin. En passant, it is my conviction that a white skin is not natural to man, and that by nature he has either a black or brown skin like our forefathers, the Hindoos, and that the white man was never originally created by nature; and that, therefore, there is no race of white people, much as it is talked about, but every white man is a bleached one. Driven up into the north, where he was a stranger, and where he existed only like an exotic plant, in need of a hothouse in winter, man in the course of centuries became white. The gipsies, an Indian tribe which emigrated only about four centuries ago, show the transition of the Hindoo's complexion to ours. In love, therefore, nature strives to return to dark hair and brown eyes, because they are the original type; still, a white skin has become second nature, although not to such an extent as to make the dark skin of the Hindoo repellent to us.
Finally, every man tries to find the corrective of his own defects and aberrations in the particular parts of his body, and the more conspicuous the defect is the greater is his determination to correct it. This is why snub-nosed persons find an aquiline nose or a parrot-like face so indescribably pleasing; and the same thing applies to every other part of the body. Men of immoderately long and attenuated build delight in a stunted and short figure. Considerations of temperament also influence a man's choice. Each prefers a temperament the reverse of his own; but only in so far as his is a decided one.
A man who is quite perfect in some respect himself does not, it is true, desire and love imperfection in this particular respect, yet he can be more easily reconciled to it than another man, because he himself saves the children from being very imperfect in this particular. For instance, a man who has a very white skin himself will not dislike a yellowish complexion, while a man who has a yellowish complexion will consider a dazzlingly white skin divinely beautiful. It is rare for a man to fall in love with a positively ugly woman, but when he does, it is because exact harmony in the degree of sex exists between them, and all her abnormities are precisely the opposite to, that is to say, the corrective of his. Love in these circumstances is wont to attain a high degree.
The profoundly earnest way in which we criticise and narrowly consider every part of a woman, while she on her part considers us; the scrupulously careful way we scrutinise, a woman who is beginning to please us; the fickleness of our choice; the strained attention with which a man watches his fiancée; the care he takes not to be deceived in any trait; and the great importance he attaches to every more or less essential trait,—all this is quite in keeping with the importance of the end. For the child that is to be born will have to bear a similar trait through its whole life; for instance, if a woman stoops but a little, it is possible for her son to be inflicted with a hunchback; and so in every other respect. We are not conscious of all this, naturally. On the contrary, each man imagines that his choice is made in the interest of his own pleasure (which, in reality, cannot be interested in it at all); his choice, which we must take for granted is in keeping with his own individuality, is made precisely in the interest of the species, to maintain the type of which as pure as possible is the secret task. In this case the individual unconsciously acts in the interest of something higher, that is, the species. This is why he attaches so much importance to things to which he might, nay, would be otherwise indifferent. There is something quite singular in the unconsciously serious and critical way two young people of different sex look at each other on meeting for the first time; in the scrutinising and penetrating glances they exchange, in the careful inspection which their various traits undergo. This scrutiny and analysis represent the meditation of the genius of the species on the individual which may be born and the combination of its qualities; and the greatness of their delight in and longing for each other is determined by this meditation. This longing, although it may have become intense, may possibly disappear again if something previously unobserved comes to light. And so the genius of the species meditates concerning the coming race in all who are yet not too old. It is Cupid's work to fashion this race, and he is always busy, always speculating, always meditating. The affairs of the individual in their whole ephemeral totality are very trivial compared with those of this divinity, which concern the species and the coming race; therefore he is always ready to sacrifice the individual regardlessly. He is related to these ephemeral affairs as an immortal being is to a mortal, and his interests to theirs as infinite to finite. Conscious, therefore, of administering affairs of a higher order than those that concern merely the weal and woe of the individual, he administers them with sublime indifference amid the tumult of war, the bustle of business, or the raging of a plague—indeed, he pursues them into the seclusion of the cloisters.
It has been seen that the intensity of love grows with its individuation; we have shown that two individuals may be so physically constituted, that, in order to restore the best possible type of the species, the one is the special and perfect complement of the other, which, in consequence, exclusively desires it. In a case of this kind, passionate love arises, and as it is bestowed on one object, and one only—that is to say, because it appears in the special service of the species—it immediately assumes a nobler and sublimer nature. On the other hand, mere sexual instinct is base, because, without individuation, it is directed to all, and strives to preserve the species merely as regards quantity with little regard for quality. Intense love concentrated on one individual may develop to such a degree, that unless it is gratified all the good things of this world, and even life itself, lose their importance. It then becomes a desire, the intensity of which is like none other; consequently it will make any kind of sacrifice, and should it happen that it cannot be gratified, it may lead to madness or even suicide. Besides these unconscious considerations which are the source of passionate love, there must be still others, which we have not so directly before us. Therefore, we must take it for granted that here there is not only a fitness of constitution but also a special fitness between the man's will and the woman's intellect, in consequence of which a perfectly definite individual can be born to them alone, whose existence is contemplated by the genius of the species for reasons to us impenetrable, since they are the very essence of the thing-in-itself. Or more strictly speaking, the will to live desires to objectivise itself in an individual which is precisely determined, and can only be begotten by this particular father and this particular mother. This metaphysical yearning of the will in itself has immediately, as its sphere of action in the circle of human beings, the hearts of the future parents, who accordingly are seized with this desire. They now fancy that it is for their own sakes they are longing for what at present has purely a metaphysical end, that is to say, for what does not come within the range of things that exist in reality. In other words, it is the desire of the future individual to enter existence, which has first become possible here, a longing which proceeds from the primary source of all being and exhibits itself in the phenomenal world as the intense love of the future parents for each other, and has little regard for anything outside itself. In fact, love is an illusion like no other; it will induce a man to sacrifice everything he possesses in the world, in order to obtain this woman, who in reality will satisfy him no more than any other. It also ceases to exist when the end, which was in reality metaphysical, has been frustrated perhaps by the woman's barrenness (which, according to Hufeland, is the result of nineteen accidental defects in the constitution), just as it is frustrated daily in millions of crushed germs in which the same metaphysical life-principle struggles to exist; there is no other consolation in this than that there is an infinity of space, time, and matter, and consequently inexhaustible opportunity, at the service of the will to live.
Although this subject has not been treated by Theophrastus Paracelsus, and my entire train of thought is foreign to him, yet it must have presented itself to him, if even in a cursory way, when he gave utterance to the following remarkable words, written in quite a different context and in his usual desultory style: Hi sunt, quos Deus copulavit, ut eam, quae fuit Uriae et David; quamvis ex diametro (sic enim sibi humana mens persuadebat) cum justo et legitimo matrimonio pugnaret hoc … sed propter Salomonem, qui aliunde nasci non potuit, nisi ex Bathseba, conjuncto David semine, quamvis meretrice, conjunxit eos Deus.
The yearning of love, the ἱμερος, which has been expressed in countless ways and forms by the poets of all ages, without their exhausting the subject or even doing it justice; this longing which makes us imagine that the possession of a certain woman will bring interminable happiness, and the loss of her, unspeakable pain; this longing and this pain do not arise from the needs of an ephemeral individual, but are, on the contrary, the sigh of the spirit of the species, discerning irreparable means of either gaining or losing its ends. It is the species alone that has an interminable existence: hence it is capable of endless desire, endless gratification, and endless pain. These, however, are imprisoned in the heart of a mortal; no wonder, therefore, if it seems like to burst, and can find no expression for the announcements of endless joy or endless pain. This it is that forms the substance of all erotic poetry that is sublime in character, which, consequently, soars into transcendent metaphors, surpassing everything earthly. This is the theme of Petrarch, the material for the St. Preuxs, Werthers, and Jacopo Ortis, who otherwise could be neither understood nor explained. This infinite regard is not based on any kind of intellectual, nor, in general, upon any real merits of the beloved one; because the lover frequently does not know her well enough; as was the case with Petrarch.
It is the spirit of the species alone that can see at a glance of what value the beloved one is to it for its purposes. Moreover, great passions, as a rule, originate at first sight:
""Who ever lov'd, that lov'd not at first sight.""
—SHAKESPEARE, As You Like It, iii. 5.
Curiously enough, there is a passage touching upon this in Guzmann de Alfarache, a well-known romance written two hundred and fifty years ago by Mateo Aleman: No es necessario para que uno ame, que pase distancia de tiempo, que siga discurso, in haga eleccion, sino que con aquella primera y sola vista, concurran juntamente cierta correspondencia ó consonancia, ó lo que acá solemos vulgarmente decir, una confrontacion de sangre, à que por particular influxo suelen mover las estrellas. (For a man to love there is no need for any length of time to pass for him to weigh considerations or make his choice, but only that a certain correspondence and consonance is encountered on both sides at the first and only glance, or that which is ordinarily called a sympathy of blood, to which a peculiar influence of the stars generally impels.) Accordingly, the loss of the beloved one through a rival, or through death, is the greatest pain of all to those passionately in love; just because it is of a transcendental nature, since it affects him not merely as an individual, but also assails him in his essentia aeterna, in the life of the species, in whose special will and service he was here called. This is why jealousy is so tormenting and bitter, and the giving up of the loved one the greatest of all sacrifices. A hero is ashamed of showing any kind of emotion but that which may be the outcome of love; the reason for this is, that when he is in love it is not he, but the species which is grieving. In Calderon's Zenobia the Great there is a scene in the second act between Zenobia and Decius where the latter says, Cielos, luego tu me quieres? Perdiera cien mil victorias, Volviérame, etc. (Heavens! then you love me? For this I would sacrifice a thousand victories, etc.) In this case honour, which has hitherto outweighed every other interest, is driven out of the field directly love—i.e., the interest of the species—comes into play and discerns something that will be of decided advantage to itself; for the interest of the species, compared with that of the mere individual, however important this may be, is infinitely more important. Honour, duty, and fidelity succumb to it after they have withstood every other temptation—the menace of death even. We find the same going on in private life; for instance, a man has less conscience when in love than in any other circumstances. Conscience is sometimes put on one side even by people who are otherwise honest and straightforward, and infidelity recklessly committed if they are passionately in love—i.e., when the interest of the species has taken possession of them. It would seem, indeed, as if they believed themselves conscious of a greater authority than the interests of individuals could ever confer; this is simply because they are concerned in the interest of the species. Chamfort's utterance in this respect is remarkable: Quand un homme et une femme ont l'un pour l'autre une passion violente, il me semble toujours que quelque soient les obstacles qui les séparent, un mari, des parens, etc.; les deux amans sont l'un à l'autre, de par la Nature, qu'ils s'appartiennent de droit devin, malgré les lois et les conventions humaines…. From this standpoint the greater part of the Decameron seems a mere mocking and jeering on the part of the genius of the species at the rights and interests of the individual which it treads underfoot. Inequality of rank and all similar relations are put on one side with the same indifference and disregarded by the genius of the species, if they thwart the union of two people passionately in love with one another: it pursues its ends pertaining to endless generations, scattering human principles and scruples abroad like chaff.
For the same reason, a man will willingly risk every kind of danger, and even become courageous, although he may otherwise be faint-hearted. What a delight we take in watching, either in a play or novel, two young lovers fighting for each other—i.e., for the interest of the species—and their defeat of the old people, who had only in view the welfare of the individual! For the struggling of a pair of lovers seems to us so much more important, delightful, and consequently justifiable than any other, as the species is more important than the individual.
Accordingly, we have as the fundamental subject of almost all comedies the genius of the species with its purposes, running counter to the personal interests of the individuals presented, and, in consequence, threatening to undermine their happiness. As a rule it carries out its ends, which, in keeping with true poetic justice, satisfies the spectator, because the latter feels that the purposes of the species widely surpass those of the individual. Hence he is quite consoled when he finally takes leave of the victorious lovers, sharing with them the illusion that they have established their own happiness, while, in truth, they have sacrificed it for the welfare of the species, in opposition to the will of the discreet old people.
It has been attempted in a few out-of-the-way comedies to reverse this state of things and to effect the happiness of the individuals at the cost of the ends of the species; but here the spectator is sensible of the pain inflicted on the genius of the species, and does not find consolation in the advantages that are assured to the individuals.
Two very well-known little pieces occur to me as examples of this kind: La reine de 16 ans, and Le mariage de raison.
In the love-affairs that are treated in tragedies the lovers, as a rule, perish together: the reason for this is that the purposes of the species, whose tools the lovers were, have been frustrated, as, for instance, in Romeo and Juliet, Tancred, Don Carlos, Wallenstein, The Bride of Messina, and so on.
A man in love frequently furnishes comic as well as tragic aspects; for being in the possession of the spirit of the species and controlled by it, he no longer belongs to himself, and consequently his line of conduct is not in keeping with that of the individual. It is fundamentally this that in the higher phases of love gives such a poetical and sublime colour, nay, transcendental and hyperphysical turn to a man's thoughts, whereby he appears to lose sight of his essentially material purpose. He is inspired by the spirit of the species, whose affairs are infinitely more important than any which concern mere individuals, in order to establish by special mandate of this spirit the existence of an indefinitely long posterity with this particular and precisely determined nature, which it can receive only from him as father and his loved one as mother, and which, moreover, as such never comes into existence, while the objectivation of the will to live expressly demands this existence. It is the feeling that he is engaged in affairs of such transcendent importance that exalts the lover above everything earthly, nay, indeed, above himself, and gives such a hyperphysical clothing to his physical wishes, that love becomes, even in the life of the most prosaic, a poetical episode; and then the affair often assumes a comical aspect. That mandate of the will which objectifies itself in the species presents itself in the consciousness of the lover under the mask of the anticipation of an infinite happiness, which is to be found in his union with this particular woman. This illusion to a man deeply in love becomes so dazzling that if it cannot be attained, life itself not only loses all charm, but appears to be so joyless, hollow, and uninteresting as to make him too disgusted with it to be afraid of the terrors of death; this is why he sometimes of his own free will cuts his life short. The will of a man of this kind has become engulfed in that of the species, or the will of the species has obtained so great an ascendency over the will of the individual that if such a man cannot be effective in the manifestation of the first, he disdains to be so in the last. The individual in this case is too weak a vessel to bear the infinite longing of the will of the species concentrated upon a definite object. When this is the case suicide is the result, and sometimes suicide of the two lovers; unless nature, to prevent this, causes insanity, which then enshrouds with its veil the consciousness of so hopeless a condition. The truth of this is confirmed yearly by various cases of this description.
However, it is not only unrequited love that leads frequently to a tragic end; for requited love more frequently leads to unhappiness than to happiness. This is because its demands often so severely clash with the personal welfare of the lover concerned as to undermine it, since the demands are incompatible with the lover's other circumstances, and in consequence destroy the plans of life built upon them. Further, love frequently runs counter not only to external circumstances but to the individuality itself, for it may fling itself upon a person who, apart from the relation of sex, may become hateful, despicable, nay, even repulsive. As the will of the species, however, is so very much stronger than that of the individual, the lover shuts his eyes to all objectionable qualities, overlooks everything, ignores all, and unites himself for ever to the object of his passion. He is so completely blinded by this illusion that as soon as the will of the species is accomplished the illusion vanishes and leaves in its place a hateful companion for life. From this it is obvious why we often see very intelligent, nay, distinguished men married to dragons and she-devils, and why we cannot understand how it was possible for them to make such a choice. Accordingly, the ancients represented Amor as blind. In fact, it is possible for a lover to clearly recognise and be bitterly conscious of horrid defects in his fiancée's disposition and character—defects which promise him a life of misery—and yet for him not to be filled with fear:
""I ask not, I care not,
If guilt's in thy heart;
I know that I love thee,
Whatever thou art.""
For, in truth, he is not acting in his own interest but in that of a third person, who has yet to come into existence, albeit he is under the impression that he is acting in his own But it is this very acting in some one else's interest which is everywhere the stamp of greatness and gives to passionate love the touch of the sublime, making it a worthy subject for the poet. Finally, a man may both love and hate his beloved at the same time. Accordingly, Plato compares a man's love to the love of a wolf for a sheep. We have an instance of this kind when a passionate lover, in spite of all his exertions and entreaties, cannot obtain a hearing upon any terms.
""I love and hate her.""—SHAKESPEARE, Cymb. iii. 5.
When hatred is kindled, a man will sometimes go so far as to first kill his beloved and then himself. Examples of this kind are brought before our notice yearly in the newspapers. Therefore Goethe says truly:
""Bei aller verschmähten Liebe, beim höllichen Elemente!
Ich wollt', ich wüsst' was ärger's, das ich fluchen könnte!""
It is in truth no hyperbole on the part of a lover when he calls his beloved's coldness, or the joy of her vanity, which delights in his suffering, cruelty. For he has come under the influence of an impulse which, akin to the instinct of animals, compels him in spite of all reason to unconditionally pursue his end and discard every other; he cannot give it up. There has not been one but many a Petrarch, who, failing to have his love requited, has been obliged to drag through life as if his feet were either fettered or carried a leaden weight, and give vent to his sighs in a lonely forest; nevertheless there was only one Petrarch who possessed the true poetic instinct, so that Goethe's beautiful lines are true of him:
""Und wenn der Mensch in seiner Quaal verstummt,
Gab mir ein Gott, zu sagen, wie ich leide.""
As a matter of fact, the genius of the species is at continual warfare with the guardian genius of individuals; it is its pursuer and enemy; it is always ready to relentlessly destroy personal happiness in order to carry out its ends; indeed, the welfare of whole nations has sometimes been sacrificed to its caprice. Shakespeare furnishes us with such an example in Henry VI Part III., Act iii., Scenes 2 and 3. This is because the species, in which lies the germ of our being, has a nearer and prior claim upon us than the individual, so that the affairs of the species are more important than those of the individual. Sensible of this, the ancients personified the genius of the species in Cupid, notwithstanding his having the form of a child, as a hostile and cruel god, and therefore one to be decried as a capricious and despotic demon, and yet lord of both gods and men.
Συ δ' ὠ θεων τυραννε κ' ἀνθρωπων, Ἐρως. (Tu, deorum hominumque tyranne, Amor!)
Murderous darts, blindness, and wings are Cupid's attributes. The latter signify inconstancy, which as a rule comes with the disillusion following possession.
Because, for instance, love is based on an illusion and represents what is an advantage to the species as an advantage to the individual, the illusion necessarily vanishes directly the end of the species has been attained. The spirit of the species, which for the time being has got the individual into its possession, now frees him again. Deserted by the spirit, he relapses into his original state of narrowness and want; he is surprised to find that after all his lofty, heroic, and endless attempts to further his own pleasure he has obtained but little; and contrary to his expectation, he finds that he is no happier than he was before. He discovers that he has been the dupe of the will of the species. Therefore, as a rule, a Theseus who has been made happy will desert his Ariadne. If Petrarch's passion had been gratified his song would have become silent from that moment, as that of the birds as soon as the eggs are laid.
Let it be said in passing that, however much my metaphysics of love may displease those in love, the fundamental truth revealed by me would enable them more effectually than anything else to overcome their passion, if considerations of reason in general could be of any avail. The words of the comic poet of ancient times remain good: Quae res in se neque consilium, neque modum habet ullum, eam consilio regere non potes. People who marry for love do so in the interest of the species and not of the individuals. It is true that the persons concerned imagine they are promoting their own happiness; but their real aim, which is one they are unconscious of, is to bring forth an individual which can be begotten by them alone. This purpose having brought them together, they ought henceforth to try and make the best of things. But it very frequently happens that two people who have been brought together by this instinctive illusion, which is the essence of passionate love, are in every other respect temperamentally different. This becomes apparent when the illusion wears off, as it necessarily must.
Accordingly, people who marry for love are generally unhappy, for such people look after the welfare of the future generation at the expense of the present. Quien se casa por amores, ha de vivir con dolores (He who marries for love must live in grief), says the Spanish proverb. Marriages de convenance, which are generally arranged by the parents, will turn out the reverse. The considerations in this case which control them, whatever their nature may be, are at any rate real and unable to vanish of themselves. A marriage of this kind attends to the welfare of the present generation to the detriment of the future, it is true; and yet this remains problematical.
A man who marries for money, and not for love, lives more in the interest of the individual than in that of the species; a condition exactly opposed to truth; therefore it is unnatural and rouses a certain feeling of contempt. A girl who against the wish of her parents refuses to marry a rich man, still young, and ignores all considerations of convenance, in order to choose another instinctively to her liking, sacrifices her individual welfare to the species. But it is for this very reason that she meets with a certain approval, for she has given preference to what was more important and acted in the spirit of nature (of the species) more exactly; while the parents advised only in the spirit of individual egoism.
As the outcome of all this, it seems that to marry means that either the interest of the individual or the interest of the species must suffer. As a rule one or the other is the case, for it is only by the rarest and luckiest accident that convenance and passionate love go hand in hand. The wretched condition of most persons physically, morally, and intellectually may be partly accounted for by the fact that marriages are not generally the result of pure choice and inclination, but of all kinds of external considerations and accidental circumstances. However, if inclination to a certain degree is taken into consideration, as well as convenience, this is as it were a compromise with the genius of the species. As is well known, happy marriages are few and far between, since marriage is intended to have the welfare of the future generation at heart and not the present.
However, let me add for the consolation of the more tender-hearted that passionate love is sometimes associated with a feeling of quite another kind—namely, real friendship founded on harmony of sentiment, but this, however, does not exist until the instinct of sex has been extinguished. This friendship will generally spring from the fact that the physical, moral, and intellectual qualities which correspond to and supplement each other in two individuals in love, in respect of the child to be born, will also supplement each other in respect of the individuals themselves as opposite qualities of temperament and intellectual excellence, and thereby establish a harmony of sentiment.
The whole metaphysics of love which has been treated here is closely related to my metaphysics in general, and the light it throws upon this may be said to be as follows.
We have seen that a man's careful choice, developing through innumerable degrees to passionate love, for the satisfaction of his instinct of sex, is based upon the fundamental interest he takes in the constitution of the next generation. This overwhelming interest that he takes verifies two truths which have been already demonstrated.
First: Man's immortality, which is perpetuated in the future race. For this interest of so active and zealous a nature, which is neither the result of reflection nor intention, springs from the innermost characteristics and tendencies of our being, could not exist so continuously or exercise such great power over man if the latter were really transitory and if a race really and totally different to himself succeeded him merely in point of time.
Second: That his real nature is more closely allied to the species than to the individual. For this interest that he takes in the special nature of the species, which is the source of all love, from the most fleeting emotion to the most serious passion, is in reality the most important affair in each man's life, the successful or unsuccessful issue of which touches him more nearly than anything else. This is why it has been pre-eminently called the ""affair of the heart."" Everything that merely concerns one's own person is set aside and sacrificed, if the case require it, to this interest when it is of a strong and decided nature. Therefore in this way man proves that he is more interested in the species than in the individual, and that he lives more directly in the interest of the species than in that of the individual.
Why, then, is a lover so absolutely devoted to every look and turn of his beloved, and ready to make any kind of sacrifice for her? Because the immortal part of him is yearning for her; it is only the mortal part of him that longs for everything else. That keen and even intense longing for a particular woman is accordingly a direct pledge of the immortality of the essence of our being and of its perpetuity in the species.
To regard this perpetuity as something unimportant and insufficient is an error, arising from the fact that in thinking of the continuity of the species we only think of the future existence of beings similar to ourselves, but in no respect, however, identical with us; and again, starting from knowledge directed towards without, we only grasp the outer form of the species as it presents itself to us, and do not take into consideration its inner nature. It is precisely this inner nature that lies at the foundation of our own consciousness as its kernel, and therefore is more direct than our consciousness itself, and as thing-in-itself exempt from the principium individuationis—is in reality identical and the same in all individuals, whether they exist at the same or at different times.
This, then, is the will to live—that is to say, it is exactly that which so intensely desires both life and continuance, and which accordingly remains unharmed and unaffected by death. Further, its present state cannot be improved, and while there is life it is certain of the unceasing sufferings and death of the individual. The denial of the will to live is reserved to free it from this, as the means by which the individual will breaks away from the stem of the species, and surrenders that existence in it.
We are wanting both in ideas and all data as to what it is after that. We can only indicate it as something which is free to be will to live or not to live. Buddhism distinguishes the latter case by the word Nirvana. It is the point which as such remains for ever impenetrable to all human knowledge.
Looking at the turmoil of life from this standpoint we find all occupied with its want and misery, exerting all their strength in order to satisfy its endless needs and avert manifold suffering, without, however, daring to expect anything else in return than merely the preservation of this tormented individual existence for a short span of time. And yet, amid all this turmoil we see a pair of lovers exchanging longing glances—yet why so secretly, timidly, and stealthily? Because these lovers are traitors secretly striving to perpetuate all this misery and turmoil that otherwise would come to a timely end.

112,84302714,N.N. N. (Ngayon Nauna Na),Smugglaz,[18],['Hip Hop/Rap'],"MR. JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.
Appellant, Gary Duncan, was convicted of simple battery in the Twenty-fifth Judicial District Court of Louisiana. Under Louisiana law simple battery is a misdemeanor, punishable by a maximum of two years' imprisonment and a $300 fine. Appellant sought trial by jury, but because the Louisiana Constitution grants jury trials only in cases in which capital punishment or imprisonment at hard labor may be imposed, the trial judge denied the request. Appellant was convicted and sentenced to serve 60 days in the parish prison and pay a fine of $150. Appellant sought review in the Supreme Court of Louisiana, asserting that the denial of jury trial violated rights guaranteed to him by the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court, finding ""o error of law in the ruling complained of,"" denied appellant a writ of certiorari. Pursuant to 28 U. S. C. § 1257 (2) appellant sought review in this Court, alleging that the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution secure the right to jury trial in state criminal prosecutions where a sentence as long as two years may be imposed. We noted probable jurisdiction, and set the case for oral argument with No. 52, Bloom v. Illinois, post, p. 194.
Appellant was 19 years of age when tried. While driving on Highway 23 in Plaquemines Parish on October 18, 1966, he saw two younger cousins engaged in a conversation by the side of the road with four white boys. Knowing his cousins, Negroes who had recently transferred to a formerly all-white high school, had reported the occurrence of racial incidents at the school, Duncan stopped the car, got out, and approached the six boys. At trial the white boys and a white onlooker testified, as did appellant and his cousins. The testimony was in dispute on many points, but the witnesses agreed that appellant and the white boys spoke to each other, that appellant encouraged his cousins to break off the encounter and enter his car, and that appellant was about to enter the car himself for the purpose of driving away with his cousins. The whites testified that just before getting in the car appellant slapped Herman Landry, one of the white boys, on the elbow. The Negroes testified that appellant had not slapped Landry, but had merely touched him. The trial judge concluded that the State had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Duncan had committed simple battery, and found him guilty.
I.The Fourteenth Amendment denies the States the power to ""deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law."" In resolving conflicting claims concerning the meaning of this spacious language, the Court has looked increasingly to the Bill of Rights for guidance; many of the rights guaranteed by the first eight Amendments to the Constitution have been held to be protected against state action by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. That clause now protects the right to compensation for property taken by the State; the rights of speech, press, and religion covered by the First Amendment; the Fourth Amendment rights to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and to have excluded from criminal trials any evidence illegally seized; the right guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment to be free of compelled self-incrimination; and the Sixth Amendment rights to counsel, to a speedy and public trial, to confrontation of opposing witnesses, and to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses.
The test for determining whether a right extended by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments with respect to federal criminal proceedings is also protected against state action by the Fourteenth Amendment has been phrased in a variety of ways in the opinions of this Court. The question has been asked whether a right is among those "" `fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions,' "" Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, 67 (1932); whether it is ""basic in our system of jurisprudence,"" In re Oliver, 333 U. S. 257, 273 (1948); and whether it is ""a fundamental right, essential to a fair trial,"" Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335, 343-344 (1963); Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, 6 (1964); Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400, 403 (1965). The claim before us is that the right to trial by jury guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment meets these tests. The position of Louisiana, on the other hand, is that the Constitution imposes upon the States no duty to give a jury trial in any criminal case, regardless of the seriousness of the crime or the size of the punishment which may be imposed. Because we believe that trial by jury in criminal cases is fundamental to the American scheme of justice, we hold that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees a right of jury trial in all criminal cases which—were they to be tried in a federal court—would come within the Sixth Amendment's guarantee. Since we consider the appeal before us to be such a case, we hold that the Constitution was violated when appellant's demand for jury trial was refused.
The history of trial by jury in criminal cases has been frequently told. It is sufficient for present purposes to say that by the time our Constitution was written, jury trial in criminal cases had been in existence in England for several centuries and carried impressive credentials traced by many to Magna Carta. Its preservation and proper operation as a protection against arbitrary rule were among the major objectives of the revolutionary settlement which was expressed in the Declaration and Bill of Rights of 1689. In the 18th century Blackstone could write:
Our law has therefore wisely placed this strong and two-fold barrier, of a presentment and a trial by jury, between the liberties of the people and the prerogative of the crown. It was necessary, for preserving the admirable balance of our constitution, to vest the executive power of the laws in the prince: and yet this power might be dangerous and destructive to that very constitution, if exerted without check or control, by justices of oyer and terminer occasionally named by the crown; who might then, as in France or Turkey, imprison, dispatch, or exile any man that was obnoxious to the government, by an instant declaration that such is their will and pleasure. But the founders of the English law have, with excellent forecast, contrived that . . . the truth of every accusation, whether preferred in the shape of indictment, information, or appeal, should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbours, indifferently chosen and superior to all suspicion.""Jury trial came to America with English colonists, and received strong support from them. Royal interference with the jury trial was deeply resented. Among the resolutions adopted by the First Congress of the American Colonies (the Stamp Act Congress) on October 19, 1765—resolutions deemed by their authors to state ""the most essential rights and liberties of the colonists""— was the declaration:
""That trial by jury is the inherent and invaluable right of every British subject in these colonies.""
The First Continental Congress, in the resolve of October 14, 1774, objected to trials before judges dependent upon the Crown alone for their salaries and to trials in England for alleged crimes committed in the colonies; the Congress therefore declared:
""That the respective colonies are entitled to the common law of England, and more especially to the great and inestimable privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, according to the course of that law.""
The Declaration of Independence stated solemn objections to the King's making ""Judges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries,"" to his ""depriving us in many cases, of the benefits of Trial by Jury,"" and to his ""transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offenses."" The Constitution itself, in Art. III, § 2, commanded:
The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall have been committed.""Objections to the Constitution because of the absence of a bill of rights were met by the immediate submission and adoption of the Bill of Rights. Included was the Sixth Amendment which, among other things, provided:
In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed.""The constitutions adopted by the original States guaranteed jury trial. Also, the constitution of every State entering the Union thereafter in one form or another protected the right to jury trial in criminal cases.
Even such skeletal history is impressive support for considering the right to jury trial in criminal cases to be fundamental to our system of justice, an importance frequently recognized in the opinions of this Court. For example, the Court has said:
Those who emigrated to this country from England brought with them this great privilege `as their birthright and inheritance, as a part of that admirable common law which had fenced around and interposed barriers on every side against the approaches of arbitrary power.' ""Jury trial continues to receive strong support. The laws of every State guarantee a right to jury trial in serious criminal cases; no State has dispensed with it; nor are there significant movements underway to do so. Indeed, the three most recent state constitutional revisions, in Maryland, Michigan, and New York, carefully preserved the right of the accused to have the judgment of a jury when tried for a serious crime.
We are aware of prior cases in this Court in which the prevailing opinion contains statements contrary to our holding today that the right to jury trial in serious criminal cases is a fundamental right and hence must be recognized by the States as part of their obligation to extend due process of law to all persons within their jurisdiction. Louisiana relies especially on Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U. S. 581 (1900); Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319 (1937); and Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U. S. 97 (1934). None of these cases, however, dealt with a State which had purported to dispense entirely with a jury trial in serious criminal cases. Maxwell held that no provision of the Bill of Rights applied to the States— a position long since repudiated—and that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment did not prevent a State from trying a defendant for a noncapital offense with fewer than 12 men on the jury. It did not deal with a case in which no jury at all had been provided. In neither Palko nor Snyder was jury trial actually at issue, although both cases contain important dicta asserting that the right to jury trial is not essential to ordered liberty and may be dispensed with by the States regardless of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. These observations, though weighty and respectable, are nevertheless dicta, unsupported by holdings in this Court that a State may refuse a defendant's demand for a jury trial when he is charged with a serious crime. Perhaps because the right to jury trial was not directly at stake, the Court's remarks about the jury in Palko and Snyder took no note of past or current developments regarding jury trials, did not consider its purposes and functions, attempted no inquiry into how well it was performing its job, and did not discuss possible distinctions between civil and criminal cases. In Malloy v. Hogan, supra, the Court rejected Palko's discussion of the self-incrimination clause. Respectfully, we reject the prior dicta regarding jury trial in criminal cases.
The guarantees of jury trial in the Federal and State Constitutions reflect a profound judgment about the way in which law should be enforced and justice administered. A right to jury trial is granted to criminal defendants in order to prevent oppression by the Government. Those who wrote our constitutions knew from history and experience that it was necessary to protect against unfounded criminal charges brought to eliminate enemies and against judges too responsive to the voice of higher authority. The framers of the constitutions strove to create an independent judiciary but insisted upon further protection against arbitrary action. Providing an accused with the right to be tried by a jury of his peers gave him an inestimable safeguard against the corrupt or overzealous prosecutor and against the compliant, biased, or eccentric judge. If the defendant preferred the common-sense judgment of a jury to the more tutored but perhaps less sympathetic reaction of the single judge, he was to have it. Beyond this, the jury trial provisions in the Federal and State Constitutions reflect a fundamental decision about the exercise of official power—a reluctance to entrust plenary powers over the life and liberty of the citizen to one judge or to a group of judges. Fear of unchecked power, so typical of our State and Federal Governments in other respects, found expression in the criminal law in this insistence upon community participation in the determination of guilt or innocence. The deep commitment of the Nation to the right of jury trial in serious criminal cases as a defense against arbitrary law enforcement qualifies for protection under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and must therefore be respected by the States.
Of course jury trial has ""its weaknesses and the potential for misuse,"" Singer v. United States, 380 U. S. 24, 35 (1965). We are aware of the long debate, especially in this century, among those who write about the administration of justice, as to the wisdom of permitting untrained laymen to determine the facts in civil and criminal proceedings. Although the debate has been intense, with powerful voices on either side, most of the controversy has centered on the jury in civil cases. Indeed, some of the severest critics of civil juries acknowledge that the arguments for criminal juries are much stronger. In addition, at the heart of the dispute have been express or implicit assertions that juries are incapable of adequately understanding evidence or determining issues of fact, and that they are unpredictable, quixotic, and little better than a roll of dice. Yet, the most recent and exhaustive study of the jury in criminal cases concluded that juries do understand the evidence and come to sound conclusions in most of the cases presented to them and that when juries differ with the result at which the judge would have arrived, it is usually because they are serving some of the very purposes for which they were created and for which they are now employed.
The State of Louisiana urges that holding that the Fourteenth Amendment assures a right to jury trial will cast doubt on the integrity of every trial conducted without a jury. Plainly, this is not the import of our holding. Our conclusion is that in the American States, as in the federal judicial system, a general grant of jury trial for serious offenses is a fundamental right, essential for preventing miscarriages of justice and for assuring that fair trials are provided for all defendants. We would not assert, however, that every criminal trial—or any particular trial—held before a judge alone is unfair or that a defendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge as he would be by a jury. Thus we hold no constitutional doubts about the practices, common in both federal and state courts, of accepting waivers of jury trial and prosecuting petty crimes without extending a right to jury trial. However, the fact is that in most places more trials for serious crimes are to juries than to a court alone; a great many defendants prefer the judgment of a jury to that of a court. Even where defendants are satisfied with bench trials, the right to a jury trial very likely serves its intended purpose of making judicial or prosecutorial unfairness less likely.
II.Louisiana's final contention is that even if it must grant jury trials in serious criminal cases, the conviction before us is valid and constitutional because here the petitioner was tried for simple battery and was sentenced to only 60 days in the parish prison. We are not persuaded. It is doubtless true that there is a category of petty crimes or offenses which is not subject to the Sixth Amendment jury trial provision and should not be subject to the Fourteenth Amendment jury trial requirement here applied to the States. Crimes carrying possible penalties up to six months do not require a jury trial if they otherwise qualify as petty offenses, Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U. S. 373 (1966). But the penalty authorized for a particular crime is of major relevance in determining whether it is serious or not and may in itself, if severe enough, subject the trial to the mandates of the Sixth Amendment. District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U. S. 617 (1937). The penalty authorized by the law of the locality may be taken ""as a gauge of its social and ethical judgments,"" 300 U. S., at 628, of the crime in question. In Clawans the defendant was jailed for 60 days, but it was the 90-day authorized punishment on which the Court focused in determining that the offense was not one for which the Constitution assured trial by jury. In the case before us the Legislature of Louisiana has made simple battery a criminal offense punishable by imprisonment for up to two years and a fine. The question, then, is whether a crime carrying such a penalty is an offense which Louisiana may insist on trying without a jury.
We think not. So-called petty offenses were tried without juries both in England and in the Colonies and have always been held to be exempt from the otherwise comprehensive language of the Sixth Amendment's jury trial provisions. There is no substantial evidence that the Framers intended to depart from this established common-law practice, and the possible consequences to defendants from convictions for petty offenses have been thought insufficient to outweigh the benefits to efficient law enforcement and simplified judicial administration resulting from the availability of speedy and inexpensive nonjury adjudications. These same considerations compel the same result under the Fourteenth Amendment. Of course the boundaries of the petty offense category have always been ill-defined, if not ambulatory. In the absence of an explicit constitutional provision, the definitional task necessarily falls on the courts, which must either pass upon the validity of legislative attempts to identify those petty offenses which are exempt from jury trial or, where the legislature has not addressed itself to the problem, themselves face the question in the first instance. In either case it is necessary to draw a line in the spectrum of crime, separating petty from serious infractions. This process, although essential, cannot be wholly satisfactory, for it requires attaching different consequences to events which, when they lie near the line, actually differ very little.
In determining whether the length of the authorized prison term or the seriousness of other punishment is enough in itself to require a jury trial, we are counseled by District of Columbia v. Clawans, supra, to refer to objective criteria, chiefly the existing laws and practices in the Nation. In the federal system, petty offenses are defined as those punishable by no more than six months in prison and a $500 fine. In 49 of the 50 States crimes subject to trial without a jury, which occasionally include simple battery, are punishable by no more than one year in jail. Moreover, in the late 18th century in America crimes triable without a jury were for the most part punishable by no more than a six-month prison term, although there appear to have been exceptions to this rule. We need not, however, settle in this case the exact location of the line between petty offenses and serious crimes. It is sufficient for our purposes to hold that a crime punishable by two years in prison is, based on past and contemporary standards in this country, a serious crime and not a petty offense. Consequently, appellant was entitled to a jury trial and it was error to deny it.
The judgment below is reversed and the case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.

MR. JUSTICE BLACK, with whom MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS joins, concurring.The Court today holds that the right to trial by jury guaranteed defendants in criminal cases in federal courts by Art. III of the United States Constitution and by the Sixth Amendment is also guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to defendants tried in state courts. With this holding I agree for reasons given by the Court. I also agree because of reasons given in my dissent in Adamson v. California, 332 U. S. 46, 68. In that dissent, at 90, I took the position, contrary to the holding in Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U. S. 78, that the Fourteenth Amendment made all of the provisions of the Bill of Rights applicable to the States. This Court in Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 323, decided in 1937, although saying ""here is no such general rule,"" went on to add that the Fourteenth Amendment may make it unlawful for a State to abridge by its statutes the
freedom of speech which the First Amendment safeguards against encroachment by the Congress . . . or the like freedom of the press . . . or the free exercise of religion . . . or the right of peaceable assembly . . . or the right of one accused of crime to the benefit of counsel . . . . In these and other situations immunities that are valid as against the federal government by force of the specific pledges of particular amendments have been found to be implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, and thus, through the Fourteenth Amendment, become valid as against the states."" Id., at 324-325.And the Palko opinion went on to explain, 302 U. S., at 326, that certain Bill of Rights' provisions were made applicable to the States by bringing them ""within the Fourteenth Amendment by a process of absorption."" Thus Twining v. New Jersey, supra, refused to hold that any one of the Bill of Rights' provisions was made applicable to the States by the Fourteenth Amendment, but Palko, which must be read as overruling Twining on this point, concluded that the Bill of Rights Amendments that are ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty"" are ""absorbed"" by the Fourteenth as protections against state invasion. In this situation I said in Adamson v. California, 332 U. S., at 89, that, while ""I would . . . extend to all the people of the nation the complete protection of the Bill of Rights,"" that ""f the choice must be between the selective process of the Palko decision applying some of the Bill of Rights to the States, or the Twining rule applying none of them, I would choose the Palko selective process."" See Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U. S. 335. And I am very happy to support this selective process through which our Court has since the Adamson case held most of the specific Bill of Rights' protections applicable to the States to the same extent they are applicable to the Federal Government. Among these are the right to trial by jury decided today, the right against compelled self-incrimination, the right to counsel, the right to compulsory process for witnesses, the right to confront witnesses, the right to a speedy and public trial, and the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.
All of these holdings making Bill of Rights' provisions applicable as such to the States mark, of course, a departure from the Twining doctrine holding that none of those provisions were enforceable as such against the States. The dissent in this case, however, makes a spirited and forceful defense of that now discredited doctrine. I do not believe that it is necessary for me to repeat the historical and logical reasons for my challenge to the Twining holding contained in my Adamson dissent and Appendix to it. What I wrote there in 1947 was the product of years of study and research. My appraisal of the legislative history followed 10 years of legislative experience as a Senator of the United States, not a bad way, I suspect, to learn the value of what is said in legislative debates, committee discussions, committee reports, and various other steps taken in the course of passage of bills, resolutions, and proposed constitutional amendments. My Brother HARLAN'S objections to my Adamson dissent history, like that of most of the objectors, relies most heavily on a criticism written by Professor Charles Fairman and published in the Stanford Law Review. 2 Stan. L. Rev. 5 (1949). I have read and studied this article extensively, including the historical references, but am compelled to add that in my view it has completely failed to refute the inferences and arguments that I suggested in my Adamson dissent. Professor Fairman's ""history"" relies very heavily on what was not said in the state legislatures that passed on the Fourteenth Amendment. Instead of relying on this kind of negative pregnant, my legislative experience has convinced me that it is far wiser to rely on what was said, and most importantly, said by the men who actually sponsored the Amendment in the Congress. I know from my years in the United States Senate that it is to men like Congressman Bingham, who steered the Amendment through the House, and Senator Howard, who introduced it in the Senate, that members of Congress look when they seek the real meaning of what is being offered. And they vote for or against a bill based on what the sponsors of that bill and those who oppose it tell them it means. The historical appendix to my Adamson dissent leaves no doubt in my mind that both its sponsors and those who opposed it believed the Fourteenth Amendment made the first eight Amendments of the Constitution (the Bill of Rights) applicable to the States.
In addition to the adoption of Professor Fairman's ""history,"" the dissent states that ""the great words of the four clauses of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment would have been an exceedingly peculiar way to say that `The rights heretofore guaranteed against federal intrusion by the first eight Amendments are henceforth guaranteed against state intrusion as well.' "" Dissenting opinion, n. 9. In response to this I can say only that the words ""No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States"" seem to me an eminently reasonable way of expressing the idea that henceforth the Bill of Rights shall apply to the States. What more precious ""privilege"" of American citizenship could there be than that privilege to claim the protections of our great Bill of Rights? I suggest that any reading of ""privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States"" which excludes the Bill of Rights' safeguards renders the words of this section of the Fourteenth Amendment meaningless. Senator Howard, who introduced the Fourteenth Amendment for passage in the Senate, certainly read the words this way. Although I have cited his speech at length in my Adamson dissent appendix, I believe it would be worthwhile to reproduce a part of it here.
Such is the character of the privileges and immunities spoken of in the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution . To these privileges and immunities, whatever they may be— for they are not and cannot be fully defined in their entire extent and precise nature—to these should be added the personal rights guarantied and secured by the first eight amendments of the Constitution; such as the freedom of speech and of the press; the right of the people peaceably to assemble and petition the Government for a redress of grievances, a right appertaining to each and all the people; the right to keep and to bear arms; the right to be exempted from the quartering of soldiers in a house without the consent of the owner; the right to be exempt from unreasonable searches and seizures, and from any search or seizure except by virtue of a warrant issued upon a formal oath or affidavit; the right of an accused person to be informed of the nature of the accusation against him, and his right to be tried by an impartial jury of the vicinage; and also the right to be secure against excessive bail and against cruel and unusual punishments.
""Now, sir, here is a mass of privileges, immunities, and rights, some of them secured by the second section of the fourth article of the Constitution, which I have recited, some by the first eight amendments of the Constitution; and it is a fact well worthy of attention that the course of decision of our courts and the present settled doctrine is, that all these immunities, privileges, rights, thus guarantied by the Constitution or recognized by it, are secured to the citizens solely as a citizen of the United States and as a party in their courts. They do not operate in the slightest degree as a restraint or prohibition upon State legislation. . . .
"". . . The great object of the first section of this amendment is, therefore, to restrain the power of the States and compel them at all times to respect these great fundamental guarantees."" Cong. Globe, 39th Cong., 1st Sess., 2765-2766 (1866).From this I conclude, contrary to my Brother HARLAN, that if anything, it is ""exceedingly peculiar"" to read the Fourteenth Amendment differently from the way I do.
While I do not wish at this time to discuss at length my disagreement with Brother HARLAN'S forthright and frank restatement of the now discredited Twining doctrine, I do want to point out what appears to me to be the basic difference between us. His view, as was indeed the view of Twining, is that ""due process is an evolving concept"" and therefore that it entails a ""gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion"" to ascertain those ""immutable principles . . . of free government which no member of the Union may disregard."" Thus the Due Process Clause is treated as prescribing no specific and clearly ascertainable constitutional command that judges must obey in interpreting the Constitution, but rather as leaving judges free to decide at any particular time whether a particular rule or judicial formulation embodies an ""immutable principl of free government"" or is ""implicit in the concept of ordered liberty,"" or whether certain conduct ""shocks the judge's conscience"" or runs counter to some other similar, undefined and undefinable standard. Thus due process, according to my Brother HARLAN, is to be a phrase with no permanent meaning, but one which is found to shift from time to time in accordance with judges' predilections and understandings of what is best for the country. If due process means this, the Fourteenth Amendment, in my opinion, might as well have been written that ""no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property except by laws that the judges of the United States Supreme Court shall find to be consistent with the immutable principles of free government."" It is impossible for me to believe that such unconfined power is given to judges in our Constitution that is a written one in order to limit governmental power.
Another tenet of the Twining doctrine as restated by my Brother HARLAN is that ""due process of law requires only fundamental fairness."" But the ""fundamental fairness"" test is one on a par with that of shocking the conscience of the Court. Each of such tests depends entirely on the particular judge's idea of ethics and morals instead of requiring him to depend on the boundaries fixed by the written words of the Constitution. Nothing in the history of the phrase ""due process of law"" suggests that constitutional controls are to depend on any particular judge's sense of values. The origin of the Due Process Clause is Chapter 39 of Magna Carta which declares that ""No free man shall be taken, outlawed, banished, or in any way destroyed, nor will We proceed against or prosecute him, except by the lawful judgment of his peers and by the law of the land."" (Emphasis added.) As early as 1354 the words ""due process of law"" were used in an English statute interpreting Magna Carta, and by the end of the 14th century ""due process of law"" and ""law of the land"" were interchangeable. Thus the origin of this clause was an attempt by those who wrote Magna Carta to do away with the so-called trials of that period where people were liable to sudden arrest and summary conviction in courts and by judicial commissions with no sure and definite procedural protections and under laws that might have been improvised to try their particular cases. Chapter 39 of Magna Carta was a guarantee that the government would take neither life, liberty, nor property without a trial in accord with the law of the land that already existed at the time the alleged offense was committed. This means that the Due Process Clause gives all Americans, whoever they are and wherever they happen to be, the right to be tried by independent and unprejudiced courts using established procedures and applying valid pre-existing laws. There is not one word of legal history that justifies making the term ""due process of law"" mean a guarantee of a trial free from laws and conduct which the courts deem at the time to be ""arbitrary,"" ""unreasonable,"" ""unfair,"" or ""contrary to civilized standards."" The due process of law standard for a trial is one in accordance with the Bill of Rights and laws passed pursuant to constitutional power, guaranteeing to all alike a trial under the general law of the land.
Finally I want to add that I am not bothered by the argument that applying the Bill of Rights to the States, ""according to the same standards that protect those personal rights against federal encroachment,"" interferes with our concept of federalism in that it may prevent States from trying novel social and economic experiments. I have never believed that under the guise of federalism the States should be able to experiment with the protections afforded our citizens through the Bill of Rights. As Justice Goldberg said so wisely in his concurring opinion in Pointer v. Texas, 380 U. S. 400:
to deny to the States the power to impair a fundamental constitutional right is not to increase federal power, but, rather, to limit the power of both federal and state governments in favor of safeguarding the fundamental rights and liberties of the individual. In my view this promotes rather than undermines the basic policy of avoiding excess concentration of power in government, federal or state, which underlies our concepts of federalism."" 380 U. S., at 414.It seems to me totally inconsistent to advocate, on the one hand, the power of this Court to strike down any state law or practice which it finds ""unreasonable"" or ""unfair"" and, on the other hand, urge that the States be given maximum power to develop their own laws and procedures. Yet the due process approach of my Brothers HARLAN and FORTAS (see other concurring opinion, post, p. 211) does just that since in effect it restricts the States to practices which a majority of this Court is willing to approve on a case-by-case basis. No one is more concerned than I that the States be allowed to use the full scope of their powers as their citizens see fit. And that is why I have continually fought against the expansion of this Court's authority over the States through the use of a broad, general interpretation of due process that permits judges to strike down state laws they do not like.
In closing I want to emphasize that I believe as strongly as ever that the Fourteenth Amendment was intended to make the Bill of Rights applicable to the States. I have been willing to support the selective incorporation doctrine, however, as an alternative, although perhaps less historically supportable than complete incorporation. The selective incorporation process, if used properly, does limit the Supreme Court in the Fourteenth Amendment field to specific Bill of Rights' protections only and keeps judges from roaming at will in their own notions of what policies outside the Bill of Rights are desirable and what are not. And, most importantly for me, the selective incorporation process has the virtue of having already worked to make most of the Bill of Rights' protections applicable to the States.
MR. JUSTICE HARLAN, whom MR. JUSTICE STEWART joins, dissenting.Every American jurisdiction provides for trial by jury in criminal cases. The question before us is not whether jury trial is an ancient institution, which it is; nor whether it plays a significant role in the administration of criminal justice, which it does; nor whether it will endure, which it shall. The question in this case is whether the State of Louisiana, which provides trial by jury for all felonies, is prohibited by the Constitution from trying charges of simple battery to the court alone. In my view, the answer to that question, mandated alike by our constitutional history and by the longer history of trial by jury, is clearly ""no.""
The States have always borne primary responsibility for operating the machinery of criminal justice within their borders, and adapting it to their particular circumstances. In exercising this responsibility, each State is compelled to conform its procedures to the requirements of the Federal Constitution. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment requires that those procedures be fundamentally fair in all respects. It does not, in my view, impose or encourage nationwide uniformity for its own sake; it does not command adherence to forms that happen to be old; and it does not impose on the States the rules that may be in force in the federal courts except where such rules are also found to be essential to basic fairness.
The Court's approach to this case is an uneasy and illogical compromise among the views of various Justices on how the Due Process Clause should be interpreted. The Court does not say that those who framed the Fourteenth Amendment intended to make the Sixth Amendment applicable to the States. And the Court concedes that it finds nothing unfair about the procedure by which the present appellant was tried. Nevertheless, the Court reverses his conviction: it holds, for some reason not apparent to me, that the Due Process Clause incorporates the particular clause of the Sixth Amendment that requires trial by jury in federal criminal cases—including, as I read its opinion, the sometimes trivial accompanying baggage of judicial interpretation in federal contexts. I have raised my voice many times before against the Court's continuing undiscriminating insistence upon fastening on the States federal notions of criminal justice, and I must do so again in this instance. With all respect, the Court's approach and its reading of history are altogether topsy-turvy.
I.I believe I am correct in saying that every member of the Court for at least the last 135 years has agreed that our Founders did not consider the requirements of the Bill of Rights so fundamental that they should operate directly against the States. They were wont to believe rather that the security of liberty in America rested primarily upon the dispersion of governmental power across a federal system. The Bill of Rights was considered unnecessary by some but insisted upon by others in order to curb the possibility of abuse of power by the strong central government they were creating.
The Civil War Amendments dramatically altered the relation of the Federal Government to the States. The first section of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes highly significant restrictions on state action. But the restrictions are couched in very broad and general terms: citizenship; privileges and immunities; due process of law; equal protection of the laws. Consequently, for 100 years this Court has been engaged in the difficult process Professor Jaffe has well called ""the search for intermediate premises."" The question has been, Where does the Court properly look to find the specific rules that define and give content to such terms as ""life, liberty, or property"" and ""due process of law""?
A few members of the Court have taken the position that the intention of those who drafted the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment was simply, and exclusively, to make the provisions of the first eight Amendments applicable to state action. This view has never been accepted by this Court. In my view, often expressed elsewhere, the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment was meant neither to incorporate, nor to be limited to, the specific guarantees of the first eight Amendments. The overwhelming historical evidence marshalled by Professor Fairman demonstrates, to me conclusively, that the Congressmen and state legislators who wrote, debated, and ratified the Fourteenth Amendment did not think they were ""incorporating"" the Bill of Rights and the very breadth and generality of the Amendment's provisions suggest that its authors did not suppose that the Nation would always be limited to mid-19th century conceptions of ""liberty"" and ""due process of law"" but that the increasing experience and evolving conscience of the American people would add new ""intermediate premises."" In short, neither history, nor sense, supports using the Fourteenth Amendment to put the States in a constitutional straitjacket with respect to their own development in the administration of criminal or civil law.
Although I therefore fundamentally disagree with the total incorporation view of the Fourteenth Amendment, it seems to me that such a position does at least have the virtue, lacking in the Court's selective incorporation approach, of internal consistency: we look to the Bill of Rights, word for word, clause for clause, precedent for precedent because, it is said, the men who wrote the Amendment wanted it that way. For those who do not accept this ""history,"" a different source of ""intermediate premises"" must be found. The Bill of Rights is not necessarily irrelevant to the search for guidance in interpreting the Fourteenth Amendment, but the reason for and the nature of its relevance must be articulated.
Apart from the approach taken by the absolute incorporationists, I can see only one method of analysis that has any internal logic. That is to start with the words ""liberty"" and ""due process of law"" and attempt to define them in a way that accords with American traditions and our system of government. This approach, involving a much more discriminating process of adjudication than does ""incorporation,"" is, albeit difficult, the one that was followed throughout the 19th and most of the present century. It entails a ""gradual process of judicial inclusion and exclusion,"" seeking, with due recognition of constitutional tolerance for state experimentation and disparity, to ascertain those ""immutable principles . . . of free government which no member of the Union may disregard."" Due process was not restricted to rules fixed in the past, for that ""would be to deny every quality of the law but its age, and to render it incapable of progress or improvement."" Nor did it impose nationwide uniformity in details, for
he Fourteenth Amendment does not profess to secure to all persons in the United States the benefit of the same laws and the same remedies. Great diversities in these respects may exist in two States separated only by an imaginary line. On one side of this line there may be a right of trial by jury, and on the other side no such right. Each State prescribes its own modes of judicial proceeding.""Through this gradual process, this Court sought to define ""liberty"" by isolating freedoms that Americans of the past and of the present considered more important than any suggested countervailing public objective. The Court also, by interpretation of the phrase ""due process of law,"" enforced the Constitution's guarantee that no State may imprison an individual except by fair and impartial procedures.
The relationship of the Bill of Rights to this ""gradual process"" seems to me to be twofold. In the first place it has long been clear that the Due Process Clause imposes some restrictions on state action that parallel Bill of Rights restrictions on federal action. Second, and more important than this accidental overlap, is the fact that the Bill of Rights is evidence, at various points, of the content Americans find in the term ""liberty"" and of American standards of fundamental fairness.
An example, both of the phenomenon of parallelism and the use of the first eight Amendments as evidence of a historic commitment, is found in the partial definition of ""liberty"" offered by Mr. Justice Holmes, dissenting in Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652:
The general principle of free speech . . . must be taken to be included in the Fourteenth Amendment, in view of the scope that has been given to the word `liberty' as there used, although perhaps it may be accepted with a somewhat larger latitude of interpretation than is allowed to Congress by the sweeping language that governs or ought to govern the laws of the United States."" Id., at 672.As another example, Mr. Justice Frankfurter, speaking for the Court in Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U. S. 25, 27-28, recognized that
he security of one's privacy against arbitrary intrusion by the police—which is at the core of the Fourth Amendment—is basic to a free society. It is therefore implicit in `the concept of ordered liberty' and as such enforceable against the States through the Due Process Clause.""The Court has also found among the procedural requirements of ""due process of law"" certain rules paralleling requirements of the first eight Amendments. For example, in Powell v. Alabama, 287 U. S. 45, the Court ruled that a State could not deny counsel to an accused in a capital case:
The fact that the right involved is of such a character that it cannot be denied without violating those `fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions' . . . is obviously one of those compelling considerations which must prevail in determining whether it is embraced within the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, although it be specifically dealt with in another part of the federal Constitution."" Id., at 67. (Emphasis added.)Later, the right to counsel was extended to all felony cases. The Court has also ruled, for example, that ""due process"" means a speedy process, so that liberty will not be long restricted prior to an adjudication, and evidence of fact will not become stale; that in a system committed to the resolution of issues of fact by adversary proceedings the right to confront opposing witnesses must be guaranteed; and that if issues of fact are tried to a jury, fairness demands a jury impartially selected. That these requirements are fundamental to procedural fairness hardly needs redemonstration.
In all of these instances, the right guaranteed against the States by the Fourteenth Amendment was one that had also been guaranteed against the Federal Government by one of the first eight Amendments. The logically critical thing, however, was not that the rights had been found in the Bill of Rights, but that they were deemed, in the context of American legal history, to be fundamental. This was perhaps best explained by Mr. Justice Cardozo, speaking for a Court that included Chief Justice Hughes and Justices Brandeis and Stone, in Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319:
If the Fourteenth Amendment has absorbed them, the process of absorption has had its source in the belief that neither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed."" Id., at 326.Referring to Powell v. Alabama, supra, Mr. Justice Cardozo continued:
The decision did not turn upon the fact that the benefit of counsel would have been guaranteed to the defendants by the provisions of the Sixth Amendment if they had been prosecuted in a federal court. The decision turned upon the fact that in the particular situation laid before us in the evidence the benefit of counsel was essential to the substance of a hearing."" Id., at 327.Mr. Justice Cardozo then went on to explain that the Fourteenth Amendment did not impose on each State every rule of procedure that some other State, or the federal courts, thought desirable, but only those rules critical to liberty:
The line of division may seem to be wavering and broken if there is a hasty catalogue of the cases on the one side and the other. Reflection and analysis will induce a different view. There emerges the perception of a rationalizing principle which gives to discrete instances a proper order and coherence. The right to trial by jury and the immunity from prosecution except as the result of an indictment may have value and importance. Even so, they are not of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty. To abolish them is not to violate a `principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental.'. . . Few would be so narrow or provincial as to maintain that a fair and enlightened system of justice would be impossible without them."" Id., at 325. (Emphasis added.)Today's Court still remains unwilling to accept the total incorporationists' view of the history of the Fourteenth Amendment. This, if accepted, would afford a cogent reason for applying the Sixth Amendment to the States. The Court is also, apparently, unwilling to face the task of determining whether denial of trial by jury in the situation before us, or in other situations, is fundamentally unfair. Consequently, the Court has compromised on the ease of the incorporationist position, without its internal logic. It has simply assumed that the question before us is whether the Jury Trial Clause of the Sixth Amendment should be incorporated into the Fourteenth, jot-for-jot and case-for-case, or ignored. Then the Court merely declares that the clause in question is ""in"" rather than ""out.""
The Court has justified neither its starting place nor its conclusion. If the problem is to discover and articulate the rules of fundamental fairness in criminal proceedings, there is no reason to no reason to assume that the whole body of rules developed in this Court constituting Sixth Amendment jury trial must be regarded as a unit. The requirement of trial by jury in federal criminal cases has given rise to numerous subsidiary questions respecting the exact scope and content of the right. It surely cannot be that every answer the Court has given, or will give, to such a question is attributable to the Founders; or even that every rule announced carries equal conviction of this Court; still less can it be that every such subprinciple is equally fundamental to ordered liberty.
Examples abound. I should suppose it obviously fundamental to fairness that a ""jury"" means an ""impartial jury."" I should think it equally obvious that the rule, imposed long ago in the federal courts, that ""jury"" means ""jury of exactly twelve,"" is not fundamental to anything: there is no significance except to mystics in the number 12. Again, trial by jury has been held to require a unanimous verdict of jurors in the federal courts, although unanimity has not been found essential to liberty in Britain, where the requirement has been abandoned.
One further example is directly relevant here. The co-existence of a requirement of jury trial in federal criminal cases and a historic and universally recognized exception for ""petty crimes"" has compelled this Court, on occasion, to decide whether a particular crime is petty, or is included within the guarantee. Individual cases have been decided without great conviction and without reference to a guiding principle. The Court today holds, for no discernible reason, that if and when the line is drawn its exact location will be a matter of such fundamental importance that it will be uniformly imposed on the States. This Court is compelled to decide such obscure borderline questions in the course of administering federal law. This does not mean that its decisions are demonstrably sounder than those that would be reached by state courts and legislatures, let alone that they are of such importance that fairness demands their imposition throughout the Nation.
Even if I could agree that the question before us is whether Sixth Amendment jury trial is totally ""in"" or totally ""out,"" I can find in the Court's opinion no real reasons for concluding that it should be ""in."" The basis for differentiating among clauses in the Bill of Rights cannot be that only some clauses are in the Bill of Rights, or that only some are old and much praised, or that only some have played an important role in the development of federal law. These things are true of all. The Court says that some clauses are more ""fundamental"" than others, but it turns out to be using this word in a sense that would have astonished Mr. Justice Cardozo and which, in addition, is of no help. The word does not mean ""analytically critical to procedural fairness"" for no real analysis of the role of the jury in making procedures fair is even attempted. Instead, the word turns out to mean ""old,"" ""much praised,"" and ""found in the Bill of Rights."" The definition of ""fundamental"" thus turns out to be circular.
II.Since, as I see it, the Court has not even come to grips with the issues in this case, it is necessary to start from the beginning. When a criminal defendant contends that his state conviction lacked ""due process of law,"" the question before this Court, in my view, is whether he was denied any element of fundamental procedural fairness. Believing, as I do, that due process is an evolving concept and that old principles are subject to re-evaluation in light of later experience, I think it appropriate to deal on its merits with the question whether Louisiana denied appellant due process of law when it tried him for simple assault without a jury.
The obvious starting place is the fact that this Court has, in the past, held that trial by jury is not a requisite of criminal due process. In the leading case, Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U. S. 581, Mr. Justice Peckham wrote as follows for the Court:
Trial by jury has never been affirmed to be a necessary requisite of due process of law. . . .
.....
"". . . The right to be proceeded against only by indictment, and the right to a trial by twelve jurors, are of the same nature, and are subject to the same judgment, and the people in the several States have the same right to provide by their organic law for the change of both or either. . . . he State has full control over the procedure in its courts, both in civil and criminal cases, subject only to the qualification that such procedure must not work a denial of fundamental rights or conflict with specific and applicable provisions of the Federal Constitution. The legislation in question is not, in our opinion, open to either of these objections."" Id., at 603-605.In Hawaii v. Mankichi, 190 U. S. 197, the question was whether the Territory of Hawaii could continue its pre-annexation procedure of permitting conviction by non-unanimous juries. The Congressional Resolution of Annexation had provided that municipal legislation of Hawaii that was not contrary to the United States Constitution could remain in force. The Court interpreted the resolution to mean only that those requirements of the Constitution that were ""fundamental"" would be binding in the Territory. After concluding that a municipal statute allowing a conviction of treason on circumstantial evidence would violate a ""fundamental"" guarantee of the Constitution, the Court continued:
We would even go farther, and say that most, if not all, the privileges and immunities contained in the bill of rights of the Constitution were intended to apply from the moment of annexation; but we place our decision of this case upon the ground that the two rights alleged to be violated in this case  are not fundamental in their nature, but concern merely a method of procedure which sixty years of practice had shown to be suited to the conditions of the islands, and well calculated to conserve the rights of their citizens to their lives, their property and their well-being."" Id., at 217-218.Numerous other cases in this Court have assumed that jury trial is not fundamental to ordered liberty.
Although it is of course open to this Court to reexamine these decisions, I can see no reason why they should now be overturned. It can hardly be said that time has altered the question, or brought significant new evidence to bear upon it. The virtues and defects of the jury system have been hotly debated for a long time, and are hotly debated today, without significant change in the lines of argument.
The argument that jury trial is not a requisite of due process is quite simple. The central proposition of Palko, supra, a proposition to which I would adhere, is that ""due process of law"" requires only that criminal trials be fundamentally fair. As stated above, apart from the theory that it was historically intended as a mere shorthand for the Bill of Rights, I do not see what else ""due process of law"" can intelligibly be thought to mean. If due process of law requires only fundamental fairness, then the inquiry in each case must be whether a state trial process was a fair one. The Court has held, properly I think, that in an adversary process it is a requisite of fairness, for which there is no adequate substitute, that a criminal defendant be afforded a right to counsel and to cross-examine opposing witnesses. But it simply has not been demonstrated, nor, I think, can it be demonstrated, that trial by jury is the only fair means of resolving issues of fact.
The jury is of course not without virtues. It affords ordinary citizens a valuable opportunity to participate in a process of government, an experience fostering, one hopes, a respect for law. It eases the burden on judges by enabling them to share a part of their sometimes awesome responsibility. A jury may, at times, afford a higher justice by refusing to enforce harsh laws (although it necessarily does so haphazardly, raising the questions whether arbitrary enforcement of harsh laws is better than total enforcement, and whether the jury system is to be defended on the ground that jurors sometimes disobey their oaths). And the jury may, or may not, contribute desirably to the willingness of the general public to accept criminal judgments as just.
It can hardly be gainsaid, however, that the principal original virtue of the jury trial—the limitations a jury imposes on a tyrannous judiciary—has largely disappeared. We no longer live in a medieval or colonial society. Judges enforce laws enacted by democratic decision, not by regal fiat. They are elected by the people or appointed by the people's elected officials, and are responsible not to a distant monarch alone but to reviewing courts, including this one.
The jury system can also be said to have some inherent defects, which are multiplied by the emergence of the criminal law from the relative simplicity that existed when the jury system was devised. It is a cumbersome process, not only imposing great cost in time and money on both the State and the jurors themselves, but also contributing to delay in the machinery of justice. Untrained jurors are presumably less adept at reaching accurate conclusions of fact than judges, particularly if the issues are many or complex. And it is argued by some that trial by jury, far from increasing public respect for law, impairs it: the average man, it is said, reacts favorably neither to the notion that matters he knows to be complex are being decided by other average men, nor to the way the jury system distorts the process of adjudication.
That trial by jury is not the only fair way of adjudicating criminal guilt is well attested by the fact that it is not the prevailing way, either in England or in this country. For England, one expert makes the following estimates. Parliament generally provides that new statutory offenses, unless they are of ""considerable gravity"" shall be tried to judges; consequently, summary offenses now outnumber offenses for which jury trial is afforded by more than six to one. Then, within the latter category, 84% of all cases are in fact tried to the court. Over all, ""the ratio of defendants actually tried by jury becomes in some years little more than 1 per cent.""
In the United States, where it has not been as generally assumed that jury waiver is permissible, the statistics are only slightly less revealing. Two experts have estimated that, of all prosecutions for crimes triable to a jury, 75% are settled by guilty plea and 40% of the remainder are tried to the court. In one State, Maryland, which has always provided for waiver, the rate of court trial appears in some years to have reached 90%. The Court recognizes the force of these statistics in stating,
We would not assert, however, that every criminal trial—or any particular trial—held before a judge alone is unfair or that a defendant may never be as fairly treated by a judge as he would be by a jury."" Ante, at 158.I agree. I therefore see no reason why this Court should reverse the conviction of appellant, absent any suggestion that his particular trial was in fact unfair, or compel the State of Louisiana to afford jury trial in an as yet unbounded category of cases that can, without unfairness, be tried to a court.
Indeed, even if I were persuaded that trial by jury is a fundamental right in some criminal cases, I could see nothing fundamental in the rule, not yet formulated by the Court, that places the prosecution of appellant for simple battery within the category of ""jury crimes"" rather than ""petty crimes."" Trial by jury is ancient, it is true. Almost equally ancient, however, is the discovery that, because of it,
the King's most loving Subjects are much travailed and otherwise encumbered in coming and keeping of the said six Weeks Sessions, to their Costs, Charges, Unquietness.""As a result, through the long course of British and American history, summary procedures have been used in a varying category of lesser crimes as a flexible response to the burden jury trial would otherwise impose.
The use of summary procedures has long been widespread. British procedure in 1776 exempted from the requirement of jury trial
iolations of the laws relating to liquor, trade and manufacture, labor, smuggling, traffic on the highway, the Sabbath, `cheats,' gambling, swearing, small thefts, assaults, offenses to property, servants and seamen, vagabondage . . .  at least a hundred more . . . ."" (Emphasis added.)Penalties for such offenses included heavy fines (with imprisonment until they were paid), whippings, and imprisonment at hard labor.
Nor had the Colonies a cleaner slate, although practices varied greatly from place to place with conditions. In Massachusetts, crimes punishable by whipping (up to 10 strokes), the stocks (up to three hours), the ducking stool, and fines and imprisonment were triable to magistrates. The decision of a magistrate could, in theory, be appealed to a jury, but a stiff recognizance made exercise of this right quite rare. New York was somewhat harsher. For example, ""anyone adjudged by two magistrates to be an idle, disorderly or vagrant person might be transported whence he came, and on reappearance be whipped from constable to constable with thirty-one lashes by each."" Anyone committing a criminal offense ""under the degree of Grand Larceny"" and unable to furnish bail within 48 hours could be summarily tried by three justices. With local variations, examples could be multiplied.
The point is not that many offenses that English-speaking communities have, at one time or another, regarded as triable without a jury are more serious, and carry more serious penalties, than the one involved here. The point is rather that until today few people would have thought the exact location of the line mattered very much. There is no obvious reason why a jury trial is a requisite of fundamental fairness when the charge is robbery, and not a requisite of fairness when the same defendant, for the same actions, is charged with assault and petty theft. The reason for the historic exception for relatively minor crimes is the obvious one: the burden of jury trial was thought to outweigh its marginal advantages. Exactly why the States should not be allowed to make continuing adjustments, based on the state of their criminal dockets and the difficulty of summoning jurors, simply escapes me.
In sum, there is a wide range of views on the desirability of trial by jury, and on the ways to make it most effective when it is used; there is also considerable variation from State to State in local conditions such as the size of the criminal caseload, the ease or difficulty of summoning jurors, and other trial conditions bearing on fairness. We have before us, therefore, an almost perfect example of a situation in which the celebrated dictum of Mr. Justice Brandeis should be invoked. It is, he said,
one of the happy incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if its citizens choose, serve as a laboratory . . . ."" New State Ice Co. v. Liebmann, 285 U. S. 262, 280, 311 (dissenting opinion).This Court, other courts, and the political process are available to correct any experiments in criminal procedure that prove fundamentally unfair to defendants. That is not what is being done today: instead, and quite without reason, the Court has chosen to impose upon every State one means of trying criminal cases; it is a good means, but it is not the only fair means, and it is not demonstrably better than the alternatives States might devise.
I would affirm the judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana.
FOOTNOTES La. Const., Art. VII, § 41:

 In one sense recent cases applying provisions of the first eight Amendments to the States represent a new approach to the ""incorporation"" debate. Earlier the Court can be seen as having asked, when inquiring into whether some particular procedural safeguard was required of a State, if a civilized system could be imagined that would not accord the particular protection. For example, Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U. S. 319, 325 (1937), stated: ""The right to trial by jury and the immunity from prosecution except as the result of an indictment may have value and importance. Even so, they are not of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty. . . . Few would be so narrow or provincial as to maintain that a fair and enlightened system of justice would be impossible without them."" The recent cases, on the other hand, have proceeded upon the valid assumption that state criminal processes are not imaginary and theoretical schemes but actual systems bearing virtually every characteristic of the common-law system that has been developing contemporaneously in England and in this country. The question thus is whether given this kind of system a particular procedure is fundamental—whether, that is, a procedure is necessary to an Anglo-American regime of ordered liberty. It is this sort of inquiry that can justify the conclusions that state courts must exclude evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment, Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U. S. 643 (1961); that state prosecutors may not comment on a defendant's failure to testify, Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609 (1965); and that criminal punishment may not be imposed for the status of narcotics addiction, Robinson v. California, 370 U. S. 660 (1962). Of immediate relevance for this case are the Court's holdings that the States must comply with certain provisions of the Sixth Amendment, specifically that the States may not refuse a speedy trial, confrontation of witnesses, and the assistance, at state expense if necessary, of counsel. See cases cited in nn. 8-12, supra. Of each of these determinations that a constitutional provision originally written to bind the Federal Government should bind the States as well it might be said that the limitation in question is not necessarily fundamental to fairness in every criminal system that might be imagined but is fundamental in the context of the criminal processes maintained by the American States.
When the inquiry is approached in this way the question whether the States can impose criminal punishment without granting a jury trial appears quite different from the way it appeared in the older cases opining that States might abolish jury trial. See, e. g., Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U. S. 581 (1900). A criminal process which was fair and equitable but used no juries is easy to imagine. It would make use of alternative guarantees and protections which would serve the purposes that the jury serves in the English and American systems. Yet no American State has undertaken to construct such a system. Instead, every American State, including Louisiana, uses the jury extensively, and imposes very serious punishments only after a trial at which the defendant has a right to a jury's verdict. In every State, including Louisiana, the structure and style of the criminal process—the supporting framework and the subsidiary procedures—are of the sort that naturally complement jury trial, and have developed in connection with and in reliance upon jury trial.

 Among the proposed amendments adopted by the House of Representatives in 1789 and submitted to the Senate was Article Fourteen:
""No State shall infringe the right of trial by Jury in criminal cases, nor the rights of conscience, nor the freedom of speech, or of the press.""
The Senate deleted this article in adopting the amendments which became the Bill of Rights. Journal of the First Session of the Senate 72; 1 Annals of Congress 76; Brennan, The Bill of Rights and the States, in E. Cahn, The Great Rights 65, 69 (1963); E. Dumbauld, The Bill of Rights 46, 215 (1957). This relatively clear indication that the framers of the Sixth Amendment did not intend its jury trial requirement to bind the States is, of course, of little relevance to interpreting the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, adopted specifically to place limitations upon the States. Cf. Fiske v. Kansas, 274 U. S. 380 (1927); Gitlow v. New York, 268 U. S. 652, 666 (1925).

""The first object of any tyrant in Whitehall would be to make Parliament utterly subservient to his will; and the next to overthrow or diminish trial by jury, for no tyrant could afford to leave a subject's freedom in the hands of twelve of his countrymen. So that trial by jury is more than an instrument of justice and more than one wheel of the constitution: it is the lamp that shows that freedom lives."" P. Devlin, Trial by Jury 164 (1956).
 A thorough summary of the arguments that have been made for and against jury trial and an extensive bibliography of the relevant literature is available at Hearings on Recording of Jury Deliberations before the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 63-81 (1955).

 Louisiana also asserts that if due process is deemed to include the right to jury trial, States will be obligated to comply with all past interpretations of the Sixth Amendment, an amendment which in its inception was designed to control only the federal courts and which throughout its history has operated in this limited environment where uniformity is a more obvious and immediate consideration. In particular, Louisiana objects to application of the decisions of this Court interpreting the Sixth Amendment as guaranteeing a 12-man jury in serious criminal cases, Thompson v. Utah, 170 U. S. 343 (1898); as requiring a unanimous verdict before guilt can be found, Maxwell v. Dow, 176 U. S. 581, 586 (1900); and as barring procedures by which crimes subject to the Sixth Amendment jury trial provision are tried in the first instance without a jury but at the first appellate stage by de novo trial with a jury, Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540, 557 (1888). It seems very unlikely to us that our decision today will require widespread changes in state criminal processes. First, our decisions interpreting the Sixth Amendment are always subject to reconsideration, a fact amply demonstrated by the instant decision. In addition, most of the States have provisions for jury trials equal in breadth to the Sixth Amendment, if that amendment is construed, as it has been, to permit the trial of petty crimes and offenses without a jury. Indeed, there appear to be only four States in which juries of fewer than 12 can be used without the defendant's consent for offenses carrying a maximum penalty of greater than one year. Only in Oregon and Louisiana can a less-than-unanimous jury convict for an offense with a maximum penalty greater than one year. However 10 States authorize first-stage trials without juries for crimes carrying lengthy penalties; these States give a convicted defendant the right to a de novo trial before a jury in a different court. The statutory provisions are listed in the briefs filed in this case.
 Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U. S. 373 (1966); District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U. S. 617 (1937); Schick v. United States, 195 U. S. 65 (1904); Natal v. Louisiana, 139 U. S. 621 (1891); see Callan v. Wilson, 127 U. S. 540 (1888). See generally Frankfurter & Corcoran, Petty Federal Offenses and the Constitutional Guaranty of Trial by Jury, 39 Harv. L. Rev. 917 (1926); Kaye, Petty Offenders Have No Peers!, 26 U. Chi. L. Rev. 245 (1959).
 18 U. S. C. § 1.
 Indeed, there appear to be only two instances, aside from the Louisiana scheme, in which a State denies jury trial for a crime punishable by imprisonment for longer than six months. New Jersey's disorderly conduct offense, N. J. Stat. Ann. § 2A:169-4 (1953), carries a one-year maximum sentence but no jury trial. The denial of jury trial was upheld by a 4-3 vote against state constitutional attack in State v. Maier, 13 N. J. 235, 99 A. 2d 21 (1953). New York State provides a jury within New York City only for offenses bearing a maximum sentence greater than one year. See People v. Sanabria, 42 Misc. 2d 464, 249 N. Y. S. 2d 66 (Sup. Ct. 1964).
 Frankfurter & Corcoran, n. 31, supra. In the instant case Louisiana has not argued that a penalty of two years' imprisonment is sufficiently short to qualify as a ""petty offense,"" but only that the penalty actually imposed on Duncan, imprisonment for 60 days, is within the petty offense category.
 It is argued that Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U. S. 373 (1966), interpreted the Sixth Amendment as meaning that to the extent that the length of punishment is a relevant criterion in distinguishing between serious crimes and petty offenses, the critical factor is not the length of the sentence authorized but the length of the penalty actually imposed. In our view that case does not reach the situation where a legislative judgment as to the seriousness of the crime is imbedded in the statute in the form of an express authorization to impose a heavy penalty for the crime in question. Cheff involved criminal contempt, an offense applied to a wide range of conduct including conduct not so serious as to require jury trial absent a long sentence. In addition criminal contempt is unique in that legislative bodies frequently authorize punishment without stating the extent of the penalty which can be imposed. The contempt statute under which Cheff was prosecuted, 18 U. S. C. § 401, treated the extent of punishment as a matter to be determined by the forum court. It is therefore understandable that this Court in Cheff seized upon the penalty actually imposed as the best evidence of the seriousness of the offense for which Cheff was tried.
 My view has been and is that the Fourteenth Amendment, as a whole, makes the Bill of Rights applicable to the States. This would certainly include the language of the Privileges and Immunities Clause, as well as the Due Process Clause.
 For a more thorough exposition of my views against this approach to the Due Process Clause, see my concurring opinion in Rochin v. California, 342 U. S. 165, 174.

 Barron v. Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243 (1833), held that the first eight Amendments restricted only federal action.
 The locus classicus for this viewpoint is The Federalist No. 51 (Madison).
 The Bill of Rights was opposed by Hamilton and other proponents of a strong central government. See The Federalist No. 84; see generally C. Rossiter, 1787: The Grand Convention 284, 302-303.

 Fairman, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of Rights? The Original Understanding, 2 Stan. L. Rev. 5 (1949). Professor Fairman was not content to rest upon the overwhelming fact that the great words of the four clauses of the first section of the Fourteenth Amendment would have been an exceedingly peculiar way to say that ""The rights heretofore guaranteed against federal intrusion by the first eight Amendments are henceforth guaranteed against state intrusion as well."" He therefore sifted the mountain of material comprising the debates and committee reports relating to the Amendment in both Houses of Congress and in the state legislatures that passed upon it. He found that in the immense corpus of comments on the purpose and effects of the proposed amendment, and on its virtues and defects, there is almost no evidence whatever for ""incorporation."" The first eight Amendments are so much as mentioned by only two members of Congress, one of whom effectively demonstrated (a) that he did not understand Barron v. Baltimore, 7 Pet. 243, and therefore did not understand the question of incorporation, and (b) that he was not himself understood by his colleagues. One state legislative committee report, rejected by the legislature as a whole, found § 1 of the Fourteenth Amendment superfluous because it duplicated the Bill of Rights: the committee obviously did not understand Barron v. Baltimore either. That is all Professor Fairman could find, in hundreds of pages of legislative discussion prior to passage of the Amendment, that even suggests incorporation.
To this negative evidence the judicial history of the Amendment could be added. For example, it proved possible for a Court whose members had lived through Reconstruction to reiterate the doctrine of Barron v. Baltimore, that the Bill of Rights did not apply to the States, without so much as questioning whether the Fourteenth Amendment had any effect on the continued validity of that principle. E. g., Walker v. Sauvinet, 92 U. S. 90; see generally Morrison, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of Rights? The Judicial Interpretation, 2 Stan. L. Rev. 140 (1949).

 The same illogical way of dealing with a Fourteenth Amendment problem was employed in Malloy v. Hogan, 378 U. S. 1, which held that the Due Process Clause guaranteed the protection of the Self-Incrimination Clause of the Fifth Amendment against state action. I disagreed at that time both with the way the question was framed and with the result the Court reached. See my dissenting opinion, id., at 14. I consider myself bound by the Court's holding in Malloy with respect to self-incrimination. See my concurring opinion in Griffin v. California, 380 U. S. 609, 615. I do not think that Malloy held, nor would I consider myself bound by a holding, that every question arising under the Due Process Clause shall be settled by an arbitrary decision whether a clause in the Bill of Rights is ""in"" or ""out.""
 The Court has so held in, e. g., Irvin v. Dowd, 366 U. S. 717. Compare Dennis v. United States, 339 U. S. 162.
 E. g., Rassmussen v. United States, 197 U. S. 516.
 E. g., Andres v. United States, 333 U. S. 740. With respect to the common-law number and unanimity requirements, the Court suggests that these present no problem because ""our decisions interpreting the Sixth Amendment are always subject to reconsideration. . . ."" Ante, at 158, n. 30. These examples illustrate a major danger of the ""incorporation"" approach—that provisions of the Bill of Rights may be watered down in the needless pursuit of uniformity. Cf. my concurring opinion in Ker v. California, 374 U. S. 23, 44. MR. JUSTICE WHITE alluded to this problem in his dissenting opinion in Malloy v. Hogan, supra, at 38.

 The precise issue in Maxwell was whether a jury of eight rather than 12 jurors could be employed in criminal prosecutions in Utah. The Court held that this was permissible because the Fourteenth Amendment did not require the States to provide trial by jury at all. The Court seems to think this was dictum. As a technical matter, however, a statement that is critical to the chain of reasoning by which a result is in fact reached does not become dictum simply because a later court can imagine a totally different way of deciding the case. See Jordan v. Massachusetts, 225 U. S. 167, 176, citing Maxwell for the proposition that ""the requirement of due process does not deprive a State of the power to dispense with jury trial altogether.""

 E. g., Deady, Trial by Jury, 17 Am. L. Rev. 398, 399-400 (1883):
""Still in these days of progress and experiment, when everything is on trial at the bar of human reason or conceit, it is quite the fashion to speak of jury trial as something that has outlived its usefulness. Intelligent and well-meaning people often sneer at it as an awkward and useless impediment to the speedy and correct administration of justice, and a convenient loop-hole for the escape of powerful and popular rogues. Considering the kind of jury trials we sometimes have in the United States, it must be admitted that this criticism is not without foundation.""
 See generally Kalven, Memorandum Regarding Jury System, printed in Hearings on Recording of Jury Deliberations before the Subcommittee to Investigate the Administration of the Internal Security Act of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 84th Cong., 1st Sess., 63-81. In particular,
""the debate has been going on for a long time (at least since 1780) and the arguments which were advanced pro and con haven't changed much in the interim. Nor, contrary to my first impression, does there seem to be any particular period in which the debate grows hotter or colder. It has always been a hot debate."" Id., at 63.
 See, e. g., Snyder v. Massachusetts, supra, at 107-108 (Cardozo, J.):
""So far as the Fourteenth Amendment is concerned, the presence of a defendant  is a condition of due process to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence, and to that extent only.""
 The point is made by, among others, A. Tocqueville. 1 Democracy in America 285 (Reeve tr.).
 The argument is developed by Curtis, The Trial Judge and the Jury, 5 Vand. L. Rev. 150 (1952). For example,
""Juries relieve the judge of the embarrassment of making the necessary exceptions. They do this, it is true, by violating their oaths, but this, I think, is better than tempting the judge to violate his oath of office."" Id., at 157.

 See, e. g., Sunderland, The Inefficiency of the American Jury, 13 Mich. L. Rev. 302, 305:
""But times have changed, and the government itself is now under the absolute control of the people. The judges, if appointed, are selected by the agents of the people, and if elected are selected by the people directly. The need for the jury as a political weapon of defense has been steadily diminishing for a hundred years, until now the jury must find some other justification for its continuance.""
 See, e. g., Sunderland, supra, at 303:
""Life was simple when the jury system was young, but with the steadily growing complexity of society and social practices, the facts which enter into legal controversies have become much more complex.""

 See, e. g., McWhorter, Abolish the Jury, 57 Am. L. Rev. 42. Statistics on this point are difficult to accumulate for the reason that the only way to measure jury performance is to compare the result reached by a jury with the result the judge would have reached in the same case. While judge-jury comparisons have many values, it is impossible to obtain a statistical comparison of accuracy in this manner. See generally H. Kalven & H. Zeisel, The American Jury, passim.
 E. g., Boston, Some Practical Remedies for Existing Defects in the Administration of Justice, 61 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1, 16:
""There is not one important personal or property interest, outside of a Court of justice, which any of us would willingly commit to the first twelve men that come along the street . . . .""
 E. g., McWhorter, supra, at 46:
""It is the jury system that consumes time at the public expense in gallery playing and sensational and theatrical exhibitions before the jury, whereby the public interest and the dignity of the law are swallowed up in a morbid, partisan or emotional personal interest in the parties immediately concerned.""
 Williams, supra, at 302.
 For example, in the federal courts the right of the defendant to waive a jury was in doubt as recently as 1930, when it was established in Patton v. United States, 281 U. S. 276.

118,173536477,OG Makk,Psychedelic Boyz,[18],['Hip Hop/Rap'],"100. Ghostface Killah ft. AZ, Kool G Rap &  Tre Williams ""The Battlefield""""The Battlefield"" is an amazing portrayal of hip-hop's recent evolution. The genre is starting to age, and so are its key musicians. Mafioso rap veterans Ghostface, AZ and Kool G take their adulthood experiences and apply them to the metaphorical battlefield. Never forget - there's a war going on outside.99. Apollo Brown & Rass Kass ft. Pharoahe Monch & Rakaa Iriscience ""H20""98. Travi$ Scott ft. Big Sean ""Don't Play""97. Mac Miller ft. Vince Staples ""Rain""96. Isaiah Rashad ft. SZA ""West Savannah""95. Vic Mensa	""Feel That""Following his breakout mixtape Innanetape and four appearances on last year’s top 100 song list, Vic Mensa is back with his Smoko Ono produced banger ""Feel That"". The song breaks away from Vic’s reputation as a “lyrical” rapper, substituting lyrical complexity for a strong flow and crazy energy. Vic’s about to take over the game and we feel that!94. Mick Jenkins	ft Joey Bada$$ ""Jerome""93. Tinashe ft Schoolboy Q ""2 On""92. Jay Electronica ft. LaTonya Givens ""Better In Tune With The Infinite""91. Big K.R.I.T. ""King Of The South""90. PRyhme ""Courtesy"" In classic Premo style, the production is lead by organs and 90's scratched vocal samples. Royce blesses us with two thrilling verses - snarky shots at his competition, sprinkled pop culture references, and packed wordplay. Rapping well is the only way he knows how, and it proves true on this record.89. Childish Gambino ""Sober""88. NehruvianDOOM ""OM""87. Drake	""How About Now""86. Statik Selektah ft Action Bronson, Royce da 5'9 & Black Thought ""The Imperial""85. O.T Genasis	""CoCo""BAKIN' SODA, I GOT BAKIN' SODA!O.T took the internet by storm with this cocaine ballad. His hilariously serious tone combined with references to Nemo and Nino Brown made us all fall in love with the coco, even Nicki Minaj. The biggest fans of this song are O.T's peers - y'all saw what happened to Busta Rhymes, right?84. Vince Staples ft James Fauntleroy ""Nate""83. Lupe Fiasco ft Ty Dolla $ign ""Deliver""82. Theophilus London ft Kanye West ""Can't Stop""81. Future ft. Andre 3000 ""Benz Friends (Whatchutola)""80. Jay Electronica ft. Jay Z ""We Made It Freestyle"" Jay Electricity and Hova joined forces at the top of the  year to murder Drake & Soulja Boy’s 2013 New Year anthem “We Made It”. The chemistry is undeniable as the two flow effortlessly over the blaring horns. While both dropped serious knowledge on The Five Percent Nation of Islam, every line packs a punch. Exhibit A? Jigga hitting Drizzy square in the jaw with this right hook: “Sorry Mrs. Drizzy for so much art talk/Silly me rappin' 'bout shit that I really bought”79. Beyonce ft. Nicki Minaj ""***Flawless Remix""78. ScHoolboy Q ""Prescription/Oxymoron""77. Travis Scott ft Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug ""Mamacita""76. YG ft. Jay Rock & ScHoolboy Q ""I Just Wanna Party""75. Dej Loaf	""Try Me""From the moment the muted twinkles of DDS’ “Try Me” beat creeps in, Dej commands the year’s most threatening anthem without ever raising her voice past a Cam’ronian monotone. It runs like a checklist of guaranteed hip-hop success. Hook? Infectious. Flow? Unique, yet copyable by the lay listener. Lyrics? Quotable. But what exalts this song to its heights is Dej Loaf’s undeniable, next-level swagger, one that makes her one rapper you really might not want to try.74. Young Thug ft. A$AP Ferg & Freddie Gibbs ""Old English""73. Lil Wayne ft. The LOX ""Gotti""72. Mick Jenkins ""The Waters""71. Game ""Bigger Than Me""70. Childish Gambino ""Candler Road""Bino pays homage to a road in his hometown in Decatur, Atlanta, a fitting name for an instrumental that contains an interpolation of his because the internet song “Telegraph Ave.” The improvised scat hook puts a cherry on top of the seemingly effortless track that stands out as his best rap song of the year.69. Wu-Tang Clan ""Ruckus In B Minor""68. Kendrick Lamar ""Untitled""67. OG Maco ""U Guessed It""66. Drake ""Draft Day""65. Donnie Trumpet ft. Chance The Rapper & Jamila Woods	""Sunday Candy""The Social Experiment, a.k.a the Chicago “symphony”, switches things up to make a truly heartwarming track. Whether it’s the soul-filled vocals from Jamila Woods & Co, or Chance the Rapper’s two verses, nostalgia oozes out of every corner of this joint. With live instrumentation and composition by SoX, this release sets expectations high for their album SURF.64. ScHoolboy Q ""Hoover Street""63. Common ft. Vince Staples ""Kingdom""62. Jay Rock ""Parental Advisory""61. Freddie Gibbs ""Shitsville""60. Action Bronson ""Easy Rider""The psych-rock sampling accompanies Bronsolino's timeless flow like a hot dog at the ball game. Gems like “I had dreams of fuckin' Keri Hilson in my Duncans. Woke up naked at the Hilton with a bitch that look like Seal's cousin” are classic Bam Bam. ""Easy Rider"" is Mr. Wonderful's acid trip on steroids.59. Eminem	""Shady XV""58. Nicki Minaj ""Anaconda""57. J.Cole ""January 28th""56. Run The Jewels ft. boots ""Early""55. Mac Miller ""Diablo""Mac hit us with “Diablo”  on his Soundcloud account out of nowhere in February. The chilling piano line and Mac's delivery perfectly complement lyrics like “Contemplating suicide like it’s a DVD / Lost inside my mind, it’s a prison homie leave me be”. The druggy philosopher we all fell in love with is back, and trippier than ever. 54. Freddie Gibbs ""Harold's""53. Slaughterhouse ""Y'all Ready Know""52. Logic ""Nikki""51. Yelawolf ""Till It's Gone""50. Pharoahe Monch ft. Black Thought ""Rapid Eye Movement""From the moment the first bar is spat, you know Pharoahe and Tariq aren't strangers to the rap game. ""My think tank's like a piranha tank think, multiple bites figure / Mega, reality, tera, giga"" starts us off with a bang. ""Rapid Eye Movement"" sounds like it belongs in a James Bond movie49. PartyNextDoor ft. Drake ""Recognize""48. Vic Mensa ""Down On My Luck""47. PRyhme	""PRyhme""46. Vince Staples ""Blue Suede""45. Rae Sremmurd	""No Flex Zone""Serving as Rae Sremmurd's debut single, this anthem quickly blew up the charts, clubs and streets to make the oddly named duo the biggest thing in hip hop. In fact, this track was so big that the remix featured two of the hottest rappers in recent times: Nicki Minaj and Pusha T44. Nicki Minaj ft. Chris Brown, Drake & Lil Wayne ""Only"" 43. Joey Bada$$	""Big Dusty""42. Run The Jewels ""Blockbuster Night Pt. 1""41. Big K.R.I.T.	""Cadillactica""40. Pusha T ""Lunch Money""What started as an accidental release turned out to be one of the best joints of the year. The G.O.D laid down the Contra style soundtrack, while King Push’s flow was flawless. The drug dealer dichotomy did it again with lines like “What's the price of success? Lost my bitch, bought a chef”. This initial offering has us fiending for King Push, and unlike 2013’s MNIMN, he won’t need a pitch either - the shit sells itself.39. YG ft. Drake ""Who Do You Love""38. Freddie Gibbs ""Deeper""37. Mac Miller ft. Da$h & Earl Sweatshirt ""New Faces V2""36. Rae Sremmurd ""No Type""35. Isaiah Rashad ""Heavenly Father""Here Isaiah Rashad delivers dark content over a soulful instrumental, creating a nice contrast between the two. A combination of Rashad's smooth, low-tempo flow, and a melodic hook from SZA, makes this for a heavenly performance. One of the best cuts from Cilvia Demo.34. Wiz Khalifa ""We Dem Boyz""33. J.Cole ""No Role Modelz""32. Future ft. Casino, Pharrell Williams & Pusha T ""Move That Dope""31. Logic ""Soul Food""30. Eminem ft. Big Sean, Danny Brown, Dej Loaf, Royce Da 5'9 & Trick Trick ""Detroit Vs Everybody"" Detroit up-and-comers Big Sean and Danny Brown come hard enough to successfully bridge the gap between Royce and Em’s bookend verses. Between another show-stealing verse from Royce, a solid hook from Dej Loaf, and an outro from the director of the “No Fly Zone” Trick Trick, this track should keep rival MCs wary of Detroit static for time to come.29. Jay Rock ft. Chantal Kreviazuk & Kendrick Lamar ""Pay For It""28. Nas ""The Season""27. Bad Meets Evil ""Vegas""26. Logic ""Gang Related""25. Freddie Gibbs ft. Danny Brown ""High""Gangster Gibbs brings Danny on a marijuana-filled trip, backed with smooth and bass-banging production courtesy of Madlib. Getting high is what they do best, and it's no surprise hearing how well both of them sound on this joint. As expected, Danny's excited and high-registered verse flows perfectly with the beat as Freddie refuses to extinguish the fire.24. T.I ft. Young Thug ""About The Money""23. Drake ""6 God""22. Eminem ft. Sia ""Guts Over Fear""21. Run The Jewels ft. Zack de la Rocha  ""Close Your Eyes (And Count To Fuck)""20. Mick Jenkins ""Jazz"" Mick rides the beat using his notorious voice conviction skills, and as the beat mellows, his voice mellows; as the beat gets more chaotic, his voice rises. The lyrics, flow, and overall vibe of the song hits your soul and makes a new home. Mick wants us to ignore the lies and corruption in the world - and we already know that this black man ain’t talkin’ all that Jazz.19. Young Jeezy ft. Jay Z ""Seen It All""Two of hip hop's most renowned hustlers join forces yet again and the result is nothing short of astonishing. The track is a clear highlight on Jeezy's album and one of Jay's finest verses in recent memory. They are both in top form as they vividly depict the experiences of their past drug dealings. You can clearly tell there's a genuine chemistry between the two. Even if you say this song blows - that's still a compliment. It was so real Jay was brought to tears while writing his verse.18. Rick Ross ft. Big Sean & Kanye West ""Sanctified""Ross gruntFeaturing Big Sean and Kanye West in addition to production by DJ Mustard and West, ""Sanctified"" was easily the most anticipated track from Rozay's 6th album, Mastermind. While Kanye's verse was a PSA to the critics who continually attempt to tarnish his reputation, Ross rapped about grilled cheese and his Rolls Royce Wraith.
Not only did ""Sanctified"" appear #1 on our Top 10 Beats of 2014 list, but it served as the background music for the greatest viral video of all time17. ILOVEMAKONNEN ft. Drake ""Tuesday (Remix)""I Love Makonnen began 2014 as a relatively unknown artist struggling to gain relevance as a musician, and trying to break free from his manslaughter charges. Then one day...Drizzy decided to drop a verse onto “Tuesday” and nothing was the same. Makonnen sings about his drug dealing past, and his busy schedule forcing him to bend the rules of when clubs can go up. Thanks to this single, clubs will never be the same on a Tuesday.16. J.Cole 	""Wet Dreamz""Over a classic sample, Cole gives us his vintage story telling as he reminisces about his first time with a girl. He holds a cool attitude as tells the girl he's a pro - even though he's never had sex before. As thing escalate further, he watches porn videos for pointers and practices putting on a condom before the plot takes a twist right at the end. What's scary is how well this song relates. We guarantee almost every male listener felt some type of way. 15. Lil Wayne ft. Drake ""Believe Me"" The release of ""Believe Me""  raised Tha Carter V's hype up few notches thanks to the perfect combination of YMCMB's finest. Drake lays down the hook and two stylistically different verses; one that bounces perfectly with the Boi-1da-produced beat, and another with a gritty flow. Wayne matches Drake verse-for-verse and ends the track in memorable fashion
One of the more underrated aspects of ""Believe Me""  is its versatility. You can bump it while you’re browsing Genius, driving to work or school, or grinding through a workout. It appeals to all ears, just as we hope the entire album will.14. ScHoolboy Q ""Break tHe Bank""Complete with a chilling piano line and a Mario Kart 64 sample from The Alchemist, the instrumental is perfect for a modern gangster rapper like ScHoolboy Q. Throughout the track he viciously reminds the listener that it's his time and that he ain't no one to fuck with. With Oxymoron debuting at number one on the billboard charts, and having sold over 320,000 copies, it is safe to say that Q is Breaking the bank. 13. A$AP Rocky ft. Juicy J ""Multiply""After some uncharacteristic features, A$AP returned with one of the hardest hitting songs of the year in ""Multiply."" The Flacko flow is on full display from the start; his signature internal rhyming bounces up and down on the beat with such rhythm that it wouldn’t matter if he used to sell crack or lemonade in his living room
Don’t worry, you won’t be seeing an A$AP Lemonade Stand anytime soon as Rocky sticks to his typical rapper and fashion references. Throw in some Juicy J trash talk for good measure and A$AP’s only single since Long.Live.A$AP is one of the year’s best. Swag swag.12. Flying Lotus ft. Kendrick Lamar ""Never Catch Me""Like a psychedelic rat race, “Never Catch Me”  has Kendrick Lamar running circles around this Flying Lotus masterpiece. The fusion of hip hop, jazz, & electronic styles has Kendrick spazzing like a rabid dog. The L.A natives take you on an outer body experience to stare death right in the face. Every few bars the instrumental changes as the race continues, like Kendrick’s searching for something, getting faster, and faster, and as you reach your destination - “bitch, you’re dead!”11. Joey Bada$$ ""Christ Conscious (Toroidal Flow)""With an aggressive flow, Joey delivers a barrage of punchlines, wordplay, and utter energy that dazzles any listener. The beauty of these lyrical acrobats continues to prolong Joey’s ability and shows he ain’t no slacker when it comes down to the lyrics. Dragon Balls like his name was Vegeata, BADA$$  swears that no matter what, he won’t stop until he reaches the level of Christ Conscious.10. Run The Jewels ""Oh My Darling Don't Cry"" Anchored by an El-P instrumental that can only be described as manic, the dynamic duo laces the beat with rhymes that are crude, insightful, and simultaneously both. What separates it from other RTJ tracks is the erosion in differences between the styles and personalities of the lead rappers. On RTJ1, Mike and El were characterized as aggressive and philosophical, respectively. But here El has no problem telling you to “run backwards through a field of dicks” as Mike peruses Egyptian scriptures. The chemistry is palpable, the flows are indescribable, and the result is one of the highlights of 2014.9. Rich Gang ft. Birdman, Rich Homie Quan & Young Thug ""Lifestyle"" EUUGHBLAHBEAHELGWLINAHDEWFQLFKQWFN LLLLLLIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIFFFFFFFFFFEEEEEEEEEEEESTYLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEFor a song that made many detractors reconsider Rich Homie Quan’s “one-hit wonder status” and mainstream listeners delve into the Young Thug archives, the unintelligible nature of the lyrics for most listeners was its greatest asset: whatever personal details you added over the beat, you felt like your efforts were putting you on the fast-track to a Dionysian lifestyle of your own.8. ScHoolboy Q ft. BJ The Chicago Kid ""Studio""ScHoolboy Q put his heart on his sleeve in this banger for the ladies, elaborating on the reality that life as a major musician can be hectic. From touring around the world to TV appearances to, in this case, late nights in the studio, it can be hard to balance a relationship with a busy work schedule.7. J.Cole ""Fire Squad""If shock factor was what Cole was after with ""Fire Squad"" then he certainly achieved it. After boasting of his greatness in the first two verses, he took an interesting approach: highlighting white appropriation in the music of black culture. Not only did he just observe the sound-jacking, he name dropped some of the most well-known artists to ever do it.6. Bobby Shmurda ""Hot Nigga""The relationship between artist and subject matter, in the hip-hop and r&b genres especially, is a dangerously liminal one. When Rick Ross gets chastised for portraying a criminal mastermind following his career in law enforcement, are we supposed to then turn around and congratulate Bobby Shmurda and his crew for their string of summer smashes for existing in a realm of authenticity? It wasn’t the lyrics, nor the beat (on its second go-around, no less!) that made Bobby so hot. So when the chant-worthy one-liners become appear as more than fiction, should we cheer? Should we scold? Or should we Shmoney Dance the troubles away?!5. Logic ""Under Pressure""The title track of the album is reminiscent of Logic’s classic brag pieces, entailing his recent rise in popularity and success. Where the initial four-minute release dropped off is the track’s elegant yet radical style shift - it transitions from his recent material success to a deeply introspective track reflecting on both his past and current state of affairs with family. This track serves as the crown jewel of the album - a diamond created from being under pressure.4. Big Sean ft. E-40 ""I Don't Fuck With You""Sean Don and Bay Area godfather E-40 went big this year with the anthem for those without fucks to give. This track dropped along with “Paradise”, “4th Quarter”, and “Jit/Juke"" through his website following the announcement of his signing to Roc Nation. The song samples “Say You Love Me”, as part of the exemplary accompaniment of Coach Kanye and DJ Mustard on the beat. His blatantly vulgar lyrics clearly express his lack of interest in those he is not ""down with"" and is reminiscent of “I Don’t Give A Fuck” from Bo$$. While it has been confirmed that the record is not meant to be a shot to anyone in particular (including Naya Rivera with whom he recently split,) the message is still….Who ever I don't fuck with, I still don't fuck with you.3. Big K.R.I.T.	""Mt. Olympus""Post KRIT's 2013 release, King Remembered In Time, more verbal lightning from Krizzle became high in demand, and he delivered. ""Mt. Olympus"" sees K.R.I.T. punish all the heathens of the rap game, showing them there really is a god. The fans wonder, ""Is he rap, is he snap?"". ""Is he bass, is he drank?"" Neither - he is a King Remembered in Time.2. Drake ""0-100/The Catch Up""If there's one thing we've learned, it's that every song really does sound like Drake featuring Drake. ""Started from the bottom, now we here"" may have been 2013's catchphrase, but ""0 to 100 nigga, real quick"" took 2014 over almost as quickly as fans grabbed the free Soundcloud download of this track after its June release
The two-part track is a variety pack, filled with braggadocio, meme-worthy lines, and introspective thoughts. What makes ""0 to 100/The Catch Up"" so notable is the instantaneous shift from straight fire bars to a calmer profession of the same sentiment: Drake is perched at the top of the rap game and he's only getting better. That's a scary thought. We've already begun to see Drake back up these claims in his latest releases, and it's safe to say the anticipation for his next full-length project is nearly off the charts.1. Kendrick Lamar ""i""Backed by funky production reminiscent of the wonder years of soul music, Kendrick broadcasts a message of self love.  The best messages are those easily understood, and Kendrick makes no mistakes with a simple ""I love myself""
Similar to our number one song last year, Kanye West's ""New Slaves"", every facet of the song’s concept was handled in one spectacularly orchestrated move. Whether it be the record, the music video, or the buzz - each element illustrates the message crystal clear. An anthem isn't created overnight, this song has been in Kendrick all his life. They can lock ya body, they can’t trap ya mind."

Without a woman or a girl?
(That's a bitch)
Yeah!

Di mo pa yata nararanasan ang pakikipagsagupa
Di nasusukat ang pagkalalaki sa dami ng nasisibak na puta
O sa pakikipagsagutan sa mga rapper na basura
Pare ko bago ka sumikat ay talagang mabibilad ka muna
Kahit isama mo mga alalay mo na nagsisipag sa una
Pero nung may nakaaway ka na nawala nagsisipagtago na
Sa cavite, sa laguna, ha pare relax ka muna
Di ka sanay sa sapakan kaya pala parang naiiyak ka nung
Nasapak ka ni
Pag hawak ko mic
(Yeah)
Nabibitak ang lupang natatapakan ng aking paa
Dapat di na kita pinapatulan pa
Kasi naman para kang batang babae
Ngunit ang di ko matanggap ay mga sumbat
Wala pa yung grupo mo si Loonie andito na
Batang makatang matapang at makulit pa buni't alipunga
Sa madaling salita papunta ka pa lang pangatlong balik ko na
Puro lang kayo bulungan plastikan akala mo mga bading
Wag mong sabihin na kung hindi dahil sayo ay wala akong mararating
Oo ikaw nga pare wala ng iba
Ang akala mo nadali mo na kami ha
Teka muna sandali kinakausap pa kita
Pasalamat ka pinapatulan pa kita
Oo ikaw nga pare wala ng iba
Ang akala mo nadali mo na kami ha
Teka muna sandali kinakausap pa kita
Pasalamat ka pinapatulan pa kita

Kapag ako'y bumanat ng mga maaalat na kataga
Siguradong kalaban ay mangangapa
Dapa
Baka matamaan ka ng mga nagbabagang bala na nagmula sa aking bunganga
Ba't ka nakatunganga
Para sa 'kin isa ka lang taga-hanga
Kung gusto mo pa pumalakpak ka
Lahat ng sumagupa'y magmumukhang tanga
Kaya wag ka ng pumalag baka kung mapano ka, bumagsak ka pa
Parang nagpilit parang umakyat ka sa puno, tapos naputol ang sanga
Kahit sumabay ka pa kulang ka pa sa tasa
Di ka pa papasa sa tunay na mga henyo
Ipagkalat mo at ikwento
Tiyak na magugulat ka sa itatayong emperyo
Oo ikaw nga pare wala ng iba
Ang akala mo nadali mo na kami ha
Teka muna sandali kinakausap pa kita
Pasalamat ka pinapatulan pa kita
Oo ikaw nga pare wala ng iba
Ang akala mo nadali mo na kami ha
Teka muna sandali kinakausap pa kita
Pasalamat ka pinapatulan pa kita

Ako'y gumawa ng konting ingay sumabay sa mga matibay
Sa aking paglabas ay nagtaasan ang mga kilay
Di makwenta ang mga letra ano na ba ang sumatutal
Nangangatal ang mga hinayupak kapag ako na ang umatungal
Na parang hari ng kagubatan walang kinatatakutan
Pero kung wala kang utak, hindi kita papatulan
Tatapakan lang kita tulad ng mga namatay sa Ultra
Sa dami ng istilo ko daig ko pa Kamasutra
Sa aking sasabihin ika'y malalabuan
Makakain ka ng almusal imbis hapunan
Kaya kung ako sa 'yo distansya amigo
Baka kasi madisgrasya ka rito
Sa mga katagang parang nagbabagsakang tala
Basta sa uulitin tandaan mo lang na
Di mo ko matatalo ang istilo ko'y moderno
Mananalo ka lang kung palinisan ng kwaderno
Oo ikaw nga pare wala ng iba
Ang akala mo nadali mo na kami ha
Teka muna sandali kinakausap pa kita
Pasalamat ka pinapatulan pa kita
Oo ikaw nga pare wala ng iba
Ang akala mo nadali mo na kami ha
Teka muna sandali kinakausap pa kita
Pasalamat ka pinapatulan pa kita
Oo ikaw nga pare wala ng iba
Ang akala mo nadali mo na kami ha
Teka muna sandali kinakausap pa kita
Pasalamat ka pinapatulan pa kita
Oo ikaw nga pare wala ng iba
Ang akala mo nadali mo na kami ha
Teka muna sandali kinakausap pa kita
Pasalamat ka pinapatulan pa kita"

That we were treated not very grand when the police and everybody is all bowing to us when we go out in all directions on Wanterlond Road with my cubarola glide? And, personably speaking, they can make their beaux to my alce, as Hillary Allen sang to the opernnine knighters. Item, we never were chained to a chair, and, bitem, no widower whother soever followed us about with a fork on Yankskilling Day. Meet a great civilian (proud lives to him!) who is gentle as a mushroom and a very affectable when he always sits forenenst us for his wet while to all whom it may concern Sully is a thug from all he drunk though he is a rattling fine bootmaker in his profession. Would we were here-arther to lodge our complaint on sergeant Laraseny in consequence of which in such steps taken his health would be constably broken into potter’s pance which would be the change of his life by a Nollwelshian which has been oxbelled out of crispianity.

Alma Luvia, Pollabella. P.S. Soldier Rollo’s sweetheart. And she’s about fetted up now with nonsery reams. And rigs out in regal rooms with the ritzies. Rags! Worns out. But she’s still her deckhuman amber too.
Soft morning, city! Lsp! I am leafy speafing. Lpf! Folty and folty all the nights have falled on to long my hair. Not a sound, falling. Lispn! No wind no word.

Two bredder as doffered as nors in soun. When one of him sighs or one of him cries ’tis you all over. No peace at all. Maybe it’s those two old crony aunts held them out to the water front. Queer Mrs Quickenough and odd Miss Dodd-pebble. And when them two has had a good few there isn’t much more dirty clothes to publish. From the Laundersdale Minssions. One chap googling the holyboy’s thingabib and this lad wetting his widdle. You were pleased as Punch, recitating war exploits and pearse orations to them jackeen gapers. But that night after, all you were wanton! Bidding me do this and that and the other. And blowing off to me, hugly Judsys, what wouldn’t you give to have a girl! Your wish was mewill.

He’s for thee what she’s for me. Dogging you round cove and haven and teaching me the perts of speech. If you spun your yarns to him on the swishbarque waves I was spelling my yearns to her over cottage cake. We’ll not disturb their sleep- ing duties. Let besoms be bosuns. It’s Phoenix, dear. And the flame is, hear! Let’s our joornee saintomichael make it. Since the lausafire has lost and the book of the depth is. Closed. Come! Step out of your shell! Hold up you free fing! Yes. We’ve light enough. I won’t take our laddy’s lampern. For them four old windbags of Gustsofairy to be blowing at. Nor you your ruck-sunck. To bring all the dannymans out after you on the hike. Send Arctur guiddus! Isma! Sft! It is the softest morning that ever I can ever remember me. But she won’t rain showerly, our Ilma. Yet. Until it’s the time. And me and you have made our. The sons of bursters won in the games. Still I’ll take me owld Finvara for my shawlders. The trout will be so fine at brookfisht. With a taste of roly polony from Blugpuddels after. To bring out the tang of the tay. Is’t you fain for a roost brood? Oaxmealturn, all out of the woolpalls! And then all the chippy young cuppinjars cluttering round us, clottering for their creams. Crying, me, grownup sister! Are me not truly? Lst! Only but, theres a but, you must buy me a fine new girdle too, nolly. When next you go to Market Norwall. They’re all saying I need it since the one from Isaacsen’s slooped its line. Mrknrk? Fy arthou! Come ! Give me your great bearspaw, padder avilky, fol a miny tiny. Dola. Mineninecy-handsy, in the languo of flows. That’s Jorgen Jargonsen. But you understood, nodst? I always know by your brights and shades. Reach down. A lil mo. So. Draw back your glave. Hot and hairy, hugon, is your hand! Here’s where the falskin begins. Smoos as an infams. One time you told you’d been burnt in ice. And one time it was chemicalled after you taking a lifeness. Maybe that’s why you hold your hodd as if. And people thinks you missed the scaffold. Of fell design. I’ll close me eyes. So not to see. Or see only a youth in his florizel, a boy in innocence, peeling a twig, a child be-side a weenywhite steed. The child we all love to place our hope in for ever. All men has done something. Be the time they’ve come to the weight of old fletch. We’ll lave it. So. We will take our walk before in the timpul they ring the earthly bells. In the church by the hearseyard. Pax Goodmens will. Or the birds start their treestirm shindy. Look, there are yours off, high on high! And cooshes, sweet good luck they’re cawing you, Coole! You see, they’re as white as the riven snae. For us. Next peaters poll you will be elicted or I’m not your elicitous bribe. The Kinsella woman’s man will never reduce me. A MacGarath O’Cullagh O’Muirk MacFewney sookadoodling and sweepacheeping round the lodge of Fjorn na Galla of the Trumpets! It’s like potting the po to shambe on the dresser or tamming Uncle Tim’s Caubeen on to the brows of a Viker Eagle. Not such big strides, huddy foddy! You’ll crush me antilopes I saved so long for. They’re Penisole’s. And the two goodiest shoeshoes. It is hardly a Knut’s mile or seven, possumbotts. It is very good for the health of a morning. With Buahbuah. A gentle motion all around. As leisure paces. And the helpyourselftoastrool cure’s easy. It seems so long since, ages since. As if you had been long far away. Afartodays, afeartonights, and me as with you in thadark. You will tell me some time if I can believe its all. You know where I am bringing you? You remember? When I ran berrying after hucks and haws. With you drawing out great aims to hazel me from the hummock with your sling. Our cries. I could lead you there and I still by you in bed. Les go dutc to Danegreven, nos? Not a soul but ourselves. Time? We have loads on our hangs. Till Gilligan and Halligan call again to hooligan. And the rest of the guns. Sullygan eight, from left to right. Olobobo, ye foxy theagues! The moskors thought to ball you out. Or the Wald Unicorns Master, Bugley Captain, from the Naul, drawls up by the door with the Honourable Whilp and the Reverend Poynter and the two Lady Pagets of Tallyhaugh, Ballyhuntus, in their riddletight raiding hats for to lift a hereshealth to their robost, the Stag, evers the Carlton hart. And you needn’t host out with your duck and your duty, capapole, while they reach him the glass he never starts to finish. Clap this wis on your poll and stick this in your ear, wiggly! Beauties don’t answer and the rich never pays. If you were the enlarged they’d hue in cry you, Heathtown, Harbourstown, Snowtown, Four Knocks, Fleming-town, Bodingtown to the Ford of Fyne on Delvin. How they housed to house you after the Platonic garlens! And all because, loosed in her reflexes, she seem she seen Ericoricori coricome huntsome with his three poach dogs aleashing him. But you came safe through. Enough of that homer corner! And old mutther-goosip! We might call on the Old Lord, what do you say? There’s something tells me. He is a fine sport. Like the score and a moighty went before him. And a proper old promnentory. His door always open. For a newera’s day. Much as your own is. You invoiced him last Eatster so he ought to give us hockockles and everything. Remember to take off your white hat, ech? When we come in the presence. And say hoothoothoo, ithmuthisthy! His is house of laws. And I’ll drop my graciast kertssey too. If the Ming Tung no go bo to me homage me hamage kow bow tow to the Mong Tang. Ceremonialness to stand lowest place be! Saying: What’ll you take to link to light a pike on porpoise, plaise? He might knight you an Armor elsor daub you the first cheap magyerstrape. Remember Bomthomanew vim vam vom Hungerig. Hoteform, chain and epolettes, botherbumbose. And I’ll be your aural eyeness. But we vain. Plain fancies. It’s in the castles air. My currant bread’s full of sillymottocraft. Aloof is anoof. We can take or leave. He’s reading his ruffs. You’ll know our way from there surely. Flura’s way. Where once we led so many car couples have follied since. Clatchka! Giving Shaugh-nessy’s mare the hillymount of her life. With her strulldeburg — ghers! Hnmn hnmn! The rollcky road adondering. We can sit us down on the heathery benn, me on you, in quolm uncon-sciounce. To scand the arising. Out from Drumleek. It was there Evora told me I had best. If I ever.

But once done, dealt and delivered, tattat, you’re on the map. Rased on traumscrapt from Maston, Boss. After rounding his world of ancient days. Carried in a caddy or screwed and corked. On his mugisstosst surface. With a bob, bob, bottledby. Blob. When the waves give up yours the soil may for me. Sometime then, somewhere there, I wrote me hopes and buried the page when I heard Thy voice, ruddery dunner, so loud that none but, and left it to lie till a kissmiss coming. So content me now. Lss. Unbuild and be buildn our bankaloan cottage there and we’ll cohabit respectable. The Gowans, ser, for Medem, me. With acute bubel runtoer for to pippup and gopeep where the sterres be. Just to see would we hear how Jove and the peers talk. Amid the soleness. Tilltop, bigmaster! Scale the summit! You’re not so giddy any more. All your graundplotting and the little it brought! Humps, when you hised us and dumps, when you doused us! But sarra one of me cares a brambling ram, pomp porteryark! On limpidy marge I’ve made me hoom. Park and a pub for me. Only don’t start your stunts of Donachie’s yeards agoad again. I could guessp to her name who tuckt you that one, tuf-nut! Bold bet backwords. For the loves of sinfintins! Before the naked universe. And the bailby pleasemarm rincing his eye! One of these fine days, lewdy culler, you must redoform again. Blessed shield Martin! Softly so. I am so exquisitely pleased about the loveleavest dress I have. You will always call me Leafiest, won’t you, dowling? Wordherfhull Ohldhbhoy! And you won’t urbjunk to me parafume, oiled of kolooney, with a spot of mara-shy. Sm! It’s Alpine Smile from Yesthers late Yhesters. I’m in everywince nasturtls. Even in Houlth’s nose. Medeurscodeignus! Astale of astoun. Grand owld marauder! If I knew who you are! When that hark from the air said it was Captain Finsen makes cum-hulments and was mayit pressing for his suit I said are you there here’s nobody here only me. But I near fell off the pile of samples. As if your tinger winged ting to me hear. Is that right what your brothermilk in Bray bes telling the district you were bragged up by Brostal because your parents would be always tumbling into his foulplace and losing her pentacosts after drinking their pledges? Howsomendeavour, you done me fine! The only man was ever known could eat the crushts of lobsters. Our native night when you twicetook me for some Marienne Sherry and then your Jermyn cousin who signs hers with exes and the beard-wig I found in your Clarksome bag. Pharaops you’ll play you’re the king of Aeships. You certainly make the most royal of noises. I will tell you all sorts of makeup things, strangerous. And show you to every simple storyplace we pass. Cadmillersfolly, Bellevenue, Wellcrom, Quid Superabit, villities valleties. Change the plates for the next course of murphies! Spendlove’s still there and the canon going strong and so is Claffey’s habits endurtaking and our parish pomp’s a great warrent. But you’ll have to ask that same four that named them is always snugging in your bar-salooner, saying they’re the best relicts of Conal O’Daniel and writing Finglas since the Flood. That’ll be some kingly work in pro-gress. But it’s by this route he’ll come some morrow. And I can signal you all flint and fern are rasstling as we go by. And you’ll sing thumb a bit and then wise your selmon on it. It is all so often and still the same to me. Snf? Only turf, wick dear! Clane turf.

Pretty mites, my sweetthings, was they poor-loves abandoned by wholawidey world? Neighboulotts for new — town. The Eblanamagna you behazyheld loomening up out of the dumblynass. But the still sama sitta. I’ve lapped so long. As you said. It fair takes. If I lose my breath for a minute or two don’t speak, remember! Once it happened, so it may again. Why I’m all these years within years in soffran, allbeleaved. To hide away the tear, the parted. It’s thinking of all. The brave that gave their. The fair that wore. All them that’s gunne. I’ll begin again in a jiffey. The nik of a nad. How glad you’ll be I waked you! My! How well you’ll feel! For ever after. First we turn by the vagurin here and then it’s gooder. So side by side, turn agate, wedding-town, laud men of Londub! I only hope whole the heavens sees us. For I feel I could near to faint away. Into the deeps. Anna-mores leep. Let me lean, just a lea, if you le, bowldstrong big — tider. Allgearls is wea. At times. So. While you’re adamant evar. Wrhps, that wind as if out of norewere! As on the night of the Apophanypes. Jumpst shootst throbbst into me mouth like a bogue and arrohs! Ludegude of the Lashlanns, how he whips me cheeks! Sea, sea! Here, weir, reach, island, bridge. Where you meet I. The day. Remember! Why there that moment and us two only? I was but teen, a tiler’s dot. The swankysuits was boosting always, sure him, he was like to me fad. But the swag-gerest swell off Shackvulle Strutt. And the fiercest freaky ever followed a pining child round the sluppery table with a forkful of fat. But a king of whistlers. Scieoula! When he’d prop me atlas against his goose and light our two candles for our singers duohs on the sewingmachine. I’m sure he squirted juice in his eyes to make them flash for flightening me. Still and all he was awful fond to me. Who’ll search for Find Me Colours now on the hilly-droops of Vikloefells? But I read in Tobecontinued’s tale that while blubles blows there’ll still be sealskers. There’ll be others but non so for me. Yed he never knew we seen us before. Night after night. So that I longed to go to. And still with all. One time you’d stand fornenst me, fairly laughing, in your bark and tan billows of I branches for to fan me coolly. And I’d lie as quiet as a moss. And one time you’d rush upon me, darkly roaring, like a great black | shadow with a sheeny stare to perce me rawly. And I’d frozen up and pray for thawe. Three times in all. I was the pet of everyone then. A princeable girl. And you were the pantymammy’s Vulking Corsergoth. The invision of Indelond. And, by Thorror, you looked it! My lips went livid for from the joy of fear. Like almost now. How? How you said how you’d give me the keys of me heart. And we’d be married till delth to uspart. And though dev do espart. O mine! Only, no, now it’s me who’s got to give. As duv herself div. Inn this linn. And can it be it’s nnow fforvell? Illas! I wisht I had better glances to peer to you through this bay-light’s growing. But you’re changing, acoolsha, you’re changing from me, I can feel. Or is it me is? I’m getting mixed. Brightening up and tightening down. Yes, you’re changing, sonhusband, and you’re turning, I can feel you, for a daughterwife from the hills again. Imlamaya. And she is coming. Swimming in my hindmoist. Diveltaking on me tail. Just a whisk brisk sly spry spink spank sprint of a thing theresomere, saultering. Saltarella come to her own. I pity your oldself I was used to. Now a younger’s there. Try not to part! Be happy, dear ones! May I be wrong! For she’ll be sweet for you as I was sweet when I came down out of me mother. My great blue bedroom, the air so quiet, scarce a cloud. In peace and silence. I could have stayed up there for always only. It’s something fails us. First we feel. Then we fall. And let her rain now if she likes. Gently or strongly as she likes. Anyway let her rain for my time is come. I done me best when I was let. Thinking always if I go all goes. A hundred cares, a tithe of troubles and is there one who understands me? One in a thousand of years of the nights? All me life I have been lived among them but now they are becoming lothed to me. And I am lothing their little warm tricks. And lothing their mean cosy turns. And all the greedy gushes out through their small souls. And all the lazy leaks down over their brash bodies. How small it’s all! And me letting on to meself always. And lilting on all the time. I thought you were all glittering with the noblest of carriage. You’re only a bumpkin. I thought you the great in all things, in guilt and in glory. You’re but a puny. Home! My people were not their sort out beyond there so far as I can. For all the bold and bad and bleary they are blamed, the seahags. No! Nor for all our wild dances in all their wild din. I can seen meself among them, alla-niuvia pulchrabelled. How she was handsome, the wild Amazia, when she would seize to my other breast! And what is she weird, haughty Niluna, that she will snatch from my ownest hair! For ’tis they are the stormies. Ho hang! Hang ho! And the clash of our cries till we spring to be free. Auravoles, they says, never heed of your name! But I’m loothing them that’s here and all I lothe. Loonely in me loneness. For all their faults. I am passing out. O bitter ending! I’ll slip away before they’re up. They’ll never see. Nor know. Nor miss me. And it’s old and old it’s sad and old it’s sad and weary I go back to you, my cold father, my cold mad father, my cold mad feary father, till the near sight of the mere size of him, the moyles and moyles of it, moananoaning, makes me seasilt saltsick and I rush, my only, into your arms. I see them rising! Save me from those therrble prongs! Two more. Onetwo moremens more. So. Avelaval. My leaves have drifted from me. All. But one clings still. I’ll bear it on me. To remind me of. Lff! So soft this morning, ours. Yes. Carry me along, taddy, like you done through the toy fair! If I seen him bearing down on me now under whitespread wings like he’d come from Arkangels, I sink I’d die down over his feet, humbly dumbly, only to washup. Yes, tid. There’s where. First. We pass through grass behush the bush to. Whish! A gull. Gulls. Far calls. Coming, far! End here. Us then. Finn, again! Take. Bussoftlhee, mememormee! Till thous-endsthee. Lps. The keys to. Given!

Do y'all recall the Pulp Fiction bar I said against Ave?
Truly that was hot
Remember; ""he marked her out before the needle""?
Same shit
Cause now you got a shooter on The Dot
I won't let this bitch play wit' me
That's the type shit I'll put you under for K (4K); 1080P
You 'bout to get all the smoke, and take so many punches
They fans yellin', ""Get off the ropes""
Play it cool or you gon' die; facts
.9 strapped, I bring them shooters where you hide at
Pull his tool you better fight back
One in the face hit him
Laid out wit' his leg twitchin'
Got K kickin'
I knew you wouldn't like that
{stumble}
The dude brave, the whole world thinkin' it's over for you?
And you know why too K (Y2K)
I'm 'bout to trip
If it's funk, I run to the trunk like Ong Bak and flip
You a bitch, got all your fans on block and shit
But watch ya tone, I'll push ya melon in (melanin), you'll never see son (sun) block again
You done hit a roadblock
Started off so hot then Ave took yo' spot
Lil' Draco, you don't get no props
I call him ""Drako"" 'cause K ain't got no stock
I'll pistol whip you wit' a loaded Glock
The .40 goin' back and forth wit' a bitch: ""Lieutenant Roast a Botch""
I had to kill him, and we ain't comin' for no classic, I'ma bag a nigga
Pack a Smith &
So you killin' me like check engine light
You won't make it past a mission (emission)
Won't body no one, chopper totin'
Dome shot, got a hollow smokin', bitch chill you not a soldier
Actin' like Caine off Menace II Society, cause somethin' Big will (Wheel) get bodied over
We came in with six sticks, so keep it on the low, like R. Kelly...try not to miss the (Mr.) Big bitch

(Kill yaself!)

Blood smearin' off (Smirnoff) the handle, it ain't a liter of vodka
Crack Rum in his coconut, I made a pina colada
My shooter pull a K out, throw the magazine in the chopper
This square's noodles will get laid out like a sheet of lasagna
I spread guns around like I'm cheatin' in Contra
I got the AA 12 on the steps like I needed a sponsor
Monster, I'm sellin' powder and the sour if you didn't know
That's green over the girl like a mistletoe
I'm crazy wit' the .380 I'll let a pistol blow
That mean I'm insane wit' the tre, but I ain't Crippin' tho
If it ain't 4th Quarter it's Team Homi, you roll wit' a clan
You met these people through battle rap but act like y'all closer than fam'
You got this gang and that gang holdin' ya hand
But you ain't no gangsta 'til you stand alone as a man
Fam'! It ain't west coast culture, it's a government side business
To destroy your community, usin' those that reside in it
And y'all still gangbang, when no loyalty lies in it
So I don't feel bad watchin' ya kids join it and die in it
Stupid! Fuckin' test tube kids
Whatchu gon' tell me? Where you from they wouldn't let you live?

All I talk about is pistols and extendos, I really stick to my guns
Aye, you better lay low, the whole gang tote

Shells hoppin' out on the flo' when the .8 blow

They gon' rummage in the garbage and see Rum is in the garbage
Bloody from each limb, I get to cuttin' through ya cartilage
I want smoke with this G pen and it's a 100 in the cartridge
I'm heartless

Fully automatic, I mean you askin' to lose
Put his lungs in his lap, split his calf into twos

Who G is in question?
I'm strapped like a lethal injection
Big boy, and didn't have to join a battle rap team for protection
At BOTB when I met him, he said, ""My G you a legend.""
So now to peep your progression, I get to see my reflection
We both punch, you stop and wait for people to catch 'em
You never scheme in succession, I throw wit' speed and aggression
I let you grow, from a child, just to teach him a lesson
I seen the holes in ya style, like a Yeezy collection

Kahit mga anghel na demonyo sa mga rimang to
Salitang malasima, lumalasong mga pantig
Tila kumukulong tubig nagpapalambot ng mga astig
Mga malalim na tinig dala ay pares at nginig
Na di mo maaninag ngunit iyong maririnig
Kaya matakot saming dulot na pagbalot ng kilabot
Na parang mga gagambang gawa sa bakal ang mga sapot
Patay sa mga banatan na sayo'y magpapa-iling
Kami halimaw sa tugma, mga halimaw sa galing (Bra!)

Perpekto, piligroso, sineryoso ng ganap
Nung nawala sa sarili ay hindi na naghanap
Kaya itong mga likha ko di niyo basta makuha
Dahil saking diksyonaryo na bago na luma
Kung saan palo na lalo, nakalagan ng kadena
Mga ideya tila higad na pumasok sa tenga
Lubhang na makati to, para di mo ikalito
Di ako butas sa sistema, ako sistema sa butas nito
Kaya mas maiigi nga atang di mo na tinangkang alamin
Kung ano-anong mga bagay aking kaya na gawin
Magmula sa ilalim naabot ko nang lahat
Nilundag ko yung bangin, hindi pababa, paakyat

Akoý sobrang gipit sa duelo
Yung masakit sa ulo masikip na sumbrero

Ödipus Es bleibt dir nicht erspart, da ich so weit
    gekommen bin in meinen Hoffnungen.
    Wo wäre auch ein höh'res Haupt, zu dem
    ich reden könnte, da mich mein Geschick
    so weit getrieben hat. Hör' zu. Mein Vater
    war Polybos, der König von Korinth,
    die Mutter Merope. Ich lebte dort,
    als erster nächst dem Throne, bis sich etwas
    begab, das seltsam zwar, allein nicht wert
    all meines Eifers war. Bei einem Gastmahl
    berauschte sich ein Mensch und nannte mich
    ein Findelkind, ein eingeschmuggeltes
    an Königsohnes statt. Ich schlug den Mann,
    daß sie für tot ihn trugen, und am Morgen,
    nein, noch die gleiche Nacht, ging ich hinein
    zu meinen Eltern und befragte sie. Sie zürnten schwer
    dem, dessen frecher Mund gesprochen hatte
    im Rausch, was nicht die Wahrheit war. Sie schlangen
    die Arme so wie nie um mich und gaben
    der Seele unvergeßlich süße Worte.
    Allein das andre Wort fraß sich mir tief und tiefer
    ins Innre und so zog ich heimlich fort
    nach Delphoi, zum Palast des Gottes, wo
    die Wahrheit aus dem Mund der Priesterin
    wie flüssig Feu'r hervorbricht. Doch Apollon, –
    merk' auf – um was ich kam, das achtete
    er nicht der Antwort wert und kündete
    mir andre schlimme grauenvolle Dinge:
    daß ich zum Weib die Mutter nehmen würde
    und Kinder zeugen, ein Geschlecht des Grausens,
    und meines Vaters Mörder sein. Und als
    ich dies vernommen, stieß ich mein Gefolge
    von mir und mied von da an mein Korinth
    und zog in fremdes Land, damit ich nie
    die Schmach des grauenvollen Spruches möchte
    an mir erfüllt sehn. Und die Wanderung
    hat mich, daß weiß ich, auch dahin geführt,
    wo dieser König, wie du sagst, erschlagen ward.
    Und, Frau, ich will die Wahrheit reden: einmal,
    an einem Abend, war ich jenem Kreuzweg
    ganz nah' – da kam ein Herold mir entgegen
    und fuhr mich an mit bösen Reden und
    er wollte nach mir schlagen. Da erschlug ich
    den Herold und nachher erschlug ich auch
    den Herrn des Wagens und die Knechte auch,
    weil sie mich binden wollten für den Henker.
    (zögernd)
    Wenn nun der Fremde irgendwie verwandt
    mit Laios war – wer wäre dann so elend,
    wie dieser Mann? Wo wäre, Weib, auf Erden,
    ein zweiter so verhaßt, so erzverhaßt
    den Göttern? Über mir kein Dach. Mich nimmt
    kein Gastfreund in sein Haus. Es redet keiner
    zu mir. Sie stoßen mich von ihrer Schwelle.
    Und das hat keiner über mich, kein andrer
    verhängt als ich. Und dann des Toten Bette,
    das wird von meinem Leib berührt, vom Leib
    des Mörders. Bin ich nicht verrucht? nicht ganz
    verworfen? Und muß ich von jetzt nicht schweifen
    auf ewig unbehaust? Nicht hier daheim,
    nicht dort? Denn setzt ich den verfluchten Fuß
    dort in die alte Heimat, müßt ich ja
    die Mutter freien und des Vaters Mörder sein,
    der mich gezeugt und aufgezogen hat,
    des Königs Polybos. Hier dies, dort das.
    Wer spielt dies Spiel mit mir? Das ist ein un-
    geheurer, grausam starker Dämon! Weh!
    O Heiliges, verborgen Webendes,
    den Tag nur lass' mich nicht erleben, lass'
    mich aus der Welt entschwinden, spurlos, ewig
    verschwinden, eh' das Schicksal auf die Stirn
    Dies blutige Brandmal drückt.
Die Greise         Noch ist ja Hoffnung!
    Die eine! bis der Mensch, der eine Zeuge,
    dess' Augen alles sah'n, gesprochen hat.
Ödipus So weit frist' ich die Hoffnung hin. So lange
    ertrag ich es, zu warten.
Jokaste Und wenn er da ist, was beschließest du,
    was dann zu tun?
Ödipus         Dann? Find' ich, daß er überein
    aussagt mit dir, dann wär' ich ja entflohn
    der fürchterlichen Angst.
Jokaste In welchem Ding? was hab' ich denn gesagt?
Ödipus Du sagst, er sprach von einer Räuberschar,
    die ihn erschlug. Ich bin ein einzelner.
    Doch wenn er einen ledig zieh'nden Wandrer nennt,
    dann fällt's auf diesen Kopf!
Jokaste So sei gewiß, so war's, so wie zuerst
    ich sagte. Wenn er widerrufen wollte,
    es waren Männer da, nicht ich allein,
    die's hörten. Und wenn er verdrehen wollte
    das eigne Wort, zur alten Meldung dies
    und jenes fügen – das – das wäre ja
    gar nichts! Dann stimmen ja aufs neue nicht
    des Laios Untergang und die Orakel.
    Denn Laios verhieß ja er, der Gott,
    daß ihm das Kind, aus meinem Schoß geboren,
    den Tod bereiten würde. Hat ihn denn
    nun dies unsel'ge Kind erschlagen, das
    längst vor dem Vater tot war? Das sind Sprüche
    von Sehern! Mich bekümmert keiner mehr.
Ödipus Wie du das ausdenkst! Du hast recht. Nur dennoch
    lass' mir den Hirten kommen.
Jokaste         Ödipus!
Ödipus Nein, das versäum' mir nicht.
Jokaste         Ich will es tun.
    In Eile send ich hin. Nur komm hinein.
        (Sie gehen in den Palast. Das Tor schließt sich. Halbdunkel, wie wenn der Mond hinter Wolken steht.)
Die Greise (treten vor.)
Der Erste Hast du gehört, wie sie von den Göttern sprachen?
    wie frech die Worte, schamlos und nackt
    aus ihrem Munde brachen?
Der Zweite Ein Etwas muß sein, es bindet das Wort,
    es bindet die Tat, es bindet die frevelnden Hände.
    Wehe, wenn nichts uns bände!
    Wenn Unzucht rast hinauf und hinab,
    das ist das Ende!
Der Dritte Unzucht wohnt in ihren Herzen,
    ein ewiger Sturm umschnaubt ihr Leben:
    es treibt sie hinauf zu schwindliger Höh,
    wo keinem zu stehen gegeben.
    Wann stürzt es sie wieder hinab
    in Jammer, Schmach und Grab?
Der Vierte In Jammer und Grab
    soll es sie werfen!
    Wenn straflos sie gehen,
    erhoben das Haupt,
    wer ist's, der noch glaubt?
    Wenn diese wandeln
    in Glanz und Ehr,
    dann opfern wir alle nicht mehr!
Der Fünfte Wie sie den Götterspruch schmähten,
    von Laios den Spruch,
    den uralten Fluch!
    Wenn sie das dürfen, wer wird noch beten!
            (Eine Pause.)
Der Erste Zum Nabel der Erde, zum delphischen Haus,
    zum strahlenden Tempel von Abä,
    trägt mich Pilger der Fuß nicht mehr!
Die Sieben (zugleich)
    Trägt mich mein Fuß nicht mehr!
Der Erste Wenn hier nicht das Göttliche kommt an den Tag,
    so, daß ich's mit Händen zu greifen vermag.
Die Sieben (zugleich)
    An euch ist's, ihr Götter, dies furchtbar zu wenden,
    wir wollen es greifen, mit diesen Händen,
    sonst opfern wir alle nicht mehr.
    (Jokaste aus dem Haus, mit den Binden der königlichen Priesterin umwunden. Vor ihr drei Mägde, zum Opferdienst in fließende Gewänder eingewunden bis unter die Augen. Sie tragen jede in goldner Schale eine lautlos lodernde blaue Flamme. Die Greise treten auseinander, ins Dunkel. Die Königin schreitet im Licht der bläulichen Flammen auf den Hain zu.
Die Greise Die Königin! Was will sie weih'n?
    (Jokaste bleibt auf der obersten Stufe zum Hain stehn. Die drei mit den Schalen stehen nebeneinander, unter der Königin.)
Jokaste Die Seele eures Königs, meines Herrn
    ist krank. Drum will ich vor die Götter treten,
    damit sie sanft ihn heilen. Denn was sind
    denn wir, wenn er zu Boden liegt, der Mann
    am Steuer und es werfen Sturm und Nacht
    das Schiff einander zu?
Ein Bote (von rückwärts auftretend)
        Ihr guten Leute,
    sagt einer mir das Haus des Ödipus?
    und wo ich selbst ihn finde, sagt mir einer?
Der Erste Dies ist sein Haus. Hier findest du ihn drin.
    Die vor dir steht, ist seine Königin,
    die Mutter seiner Kinder.
Bote         Sei gesegnet,
    du Königin, und lebe mit Gesegneten
    vereint im Leben.
Jokaste        Und das gleiche sei
    auch dir beschieden, fremder Freund. Du bist
    es wert um deines Grußes willen. Rede,
    was bringst du uns? was kommst du zu begehren?
Bote Glück deinem Haus und deinem Gatten Glück.
Jokaste Was für ein Glück? von wo kommt's hergeschwebt?
Bote Vom Land Korinth: und eine Botschaft ist's,
    die etwa wohl zugleich erfreuen ihn
    und auch betrüben mag.
Jokaste         Welch Ding ist dies,
    das Doppelkräfte hat?
Bote         Sie wollen ihn,
    die Männer dort vom Isthmusland, zum König.
Jokaste Wie? Hält nicht Polybos in alter Hand
    den Stab?
Der Bote     Nicht mehr. Denn in der Erde schläft er.
Jokaste Was sagst du Alter? Tot ist Polybos!
Der Bote So wahr ich atme, ja.
Jokaste         O meine Mädchen!
    Rhodope, Pannychis, Kalirrhoe,
    zum Herrn! zum Herrn!
        (Die Mägde eilen ins Haus.)
            Ihr Offenbarungen
    wo seid ihr nun? So lange bebte er
    vor einem Mord an diesem alten Mann:
    nun hat das Schicksal ihn erlegt, o Ödipus!
            (Ödipus tritt aus dem Haus, hinter ihm ein dunkler Gewappneter mit einer Fackel.)
Ödipus Geliebtes Herz, du hast mich holen lassen,
    von wo ich saß und dachte. Sprich, wozu.
Jokaste Den Mann da höre und dann sage mir,
    was wird aus dem erhabnen Götterspruch!
Ödipus Wer ist der Fremde und was bringt er mir?
Jokaste Der Mann ist aus Korinth und meldet bloß,
    daß Polybos, dein Vater, tot ist.
Ödipus         Was?
    Sag' das mit eignem Mund!
Der Bote         Nun denn: so sag' ich,
    er ist hinab.
Ödipus         Durch Mord? Nein? Nicht durch Mord?
    Durch Krankheit?
Der Bote         Ein geringer Anstoß war
    genug: denn er war alt.
Ödipus         So hat den Armen,
    so hat ihn Krankheit weggezehrt?
Der Bote Auch schon am Alter selbst beinahe ist
    er hingewelkt.
Ödipus         O weh! was hat man dann,
    Jokaste, noch beim pythischen Orakel
    zu suchen, warum späht man noch nach Zeichen,
    die mir mit maßlosem Betrug, daher
    gehängt den Vatermord, da über's Haupt!
    Der ist nun unterm Boden und ich hab'
    kein Schwert hier angerührt – er müßte denn
    aus Sehnsucht nach mir gestorben sein. So wär' ich
    denn freilich schuld an seinem Tod.
    Nun hat er diesen Fluch hinabgenommen,
    wo er mit ihm zu Staub zerfällt.
Jokaste         Und hab' ich
    nicht längst dir dies vorhergesagt?
Ödipus         Du hast's
    gesagt. Ich aber war vor Angst
    wie toll.
Jokaste         Nun aber mach' dich frei, auch völlig
    für immer frei.
Ödipus         Wie? Vor der Eh' der Mutter
    soll mir nicht bangen doch?
Jokaste         Was braucht der Mensch
    zu fürchten? Treibt ihn nicht das Ungefähr
    dahin und dort? Weiß er von einem Ding
    das Wesen, windet ihm nicht jeder Luftzug
    sein Selbst aus seiner Hand? Nur leben, leben
    gradhin. Bekümmre dich um kein Orakel.
    Es haben Menschen auch in Träumen schon
    gelegen bei der Mutter. Acht' es nicht,
    Wer's von sich bläst, erträgt die Last des Lebens,
    der andere erliegt.
Ödipus         Das alles sagst du
    vortrefflich, wäre nur die Mutter nicht
    am Leben. Aber da sie lebt, was soll ich
    denn anders in mir haben, als die Angst!
Jokaste Vom Grab des Vaters weht kein Trost dich an?
Ödipus Ja. Wohl. Doch, daß die Mutter lebt, das ängstet.
Der Bote Um welche Frau bist du in Ängsten, König?
Ödipus Um Merope, die Frau des Polybos.
Der Bote Was ist's mit ihr, wovor dir banget, Herr?
Ödipus Ein schlimmes Wort, von Göttern offenbart.
Der Bote Läßt es sich sagen? Oder ist verwehrt
    dem fremden Ohr?
Ödipus         Ich kann dir's sagen, Mensch.
    Mir offenbarte der zu Delphoi thront,
    umarmen würd' ich meine Mutter und
    mit eigner Hand des Vaters Blut vergießen.
    Das trieb mich von Korinth. Meinst du, ich hab'
    um nichts das hingeopfert, ihr Gesicht
    nicht mehr zu sehen?
Der Bote         Wirklich dies? Nichts andres
    vertrieb dich aus Korinth?
Ödipus         Wie, nicht genug?
    Dies eine und des Vaters Mörder werden?
Der Bote So soll ich eilen, Herr, und schnell das Wort
    dir sagen, das dich frei macht, wenn ich gut
    dir dienen will?
Ödipus         O könntest du's, ich wollte
    dir lohnen, lohnen –
Der Bote         Darum kam ich auch,
    daß du mich lohnest als ein reicher König,
    wenn du zurückkehrst in dein Vaterhaus.
Ödipus In einem Haus mit ihnen wohn' ich nicht,
    die mich geboren!
Der Bote         Nein? Dann weißt du nicht,
    Kind, was du tust.
Ödipus         So lehr' mich's Alter, red'!
    Was weiß ich nicht?
Der Bote         Wenn du um ihretwillen
    nicht heimkehrst.
Ödipus         Faß' mich doch: aus Angst, aus alter
    tödlicher Angst.
Der Bote         Vor dem, was du begehen –
    an deinen Eltern dort begehen könntest?
Ödipus Ja, Vater, ja!
Der Bote         Und, daß all' diese Angst
    um nichts ist: weil ja Polybos, du Fürst,
    gar nicht ein Blut mit dir.
Ödipus         Was redest du?
    Nicht Polybos hat mich gezeugt?
Der Bote         So wenig
    als ich, der vor dir steh'.
Ödipus         Was soll das heißen?
    Warum dann nannte er mich Sohn?
Der Bote         So wisse:
    als ein Geschenk bekam er dich aus meiner,
    aus dieser Hand da!
Ödipus         Aus der Hand des Knechtes?
    und hielt mich lieb und wert und hegte mich?
Der Bote Das macht, sie waren vordem kinderlos.
Ödipus Ein Findling bin ich? oder hast du mich
    gekauft?
Der Bote         Ein Findling aus dem Waldgeklüft
    Kithäron.
Ödipus         Wie kamst du in dies Gebirg?
Der Bote Ein Senne war ich dort, mit großer Herde
    zu Berg gefahren.
Ödipus         Solch ein Hirte warst du?
    der wandert mit dem Vieh?
Der Bote         Dein Retter war ich,
    dein Retter, lieber Sohn.
Ödipus        Du fandest mich
    in Not und Qual?
Der Bote         Wahrhaftig das bezeugen
    wohl heut' noch die Gelenke deiner Füße.
Ödipus O weh! was rührst du auf!
Der Bote         Die armen Füße
    durchbohrt, umschnürt, aus blut'gen Riemen löst' ich
    die Füße dir.
Ödipus         Verfluchte Narben, schmählich
    empfangen in den Windeln!
Der Bote         Deinen Namen
    hast du ja auch daher.
Ödipus         Jetzt rede: war's
    des Vaters oder war's der Mutter Hand,
    die das an mir getan?
Der Bote         Das weiß ich nicht.
    Der dich mir gab, wird das wohl eher wissen.
Ödipus Du fandst mich nicht? ein andrer gab mich dir?
Der Bote Ein andrer Hirte war's. Der gab dich mir.
Ödipus Wer? weißt du, wer es war?
Der Bote         Er hieß ein Knecht
    des Laios.
Ödipus         Dessen, der hier König war,
    vor mir?
Der Bote     Desselben. Ja.
Ödipus         Und lebt der Mensch?
    Kann man ihn reden machen?
Der Bote         Das müßt ihr
    am besten wissen, ihr Einheimischen.
Ödipus Ist einer unter euch, der Kunde weiß
    von diesem Hirten, den er meint? So redet.
Einer der Greise Ich mein', es ist kein andrer als der Mann
    vom Felde, den du ehe schon begehrtest.
    Ich mein, es ist gesandt um ihn. Doch hier
    die Frau wird alles dir am besten sagen.
            (Er tritt sogleich wieder ins Dunkel zurück.)
Ödipus Ich bitte, sprich: ist der, um den du schicktest
    (zu Jokaste)
der gleiche, den der Mann hier meint?
Jokaste (qualvoll)         Ich weiß nicht,
    wen dieser meint. Ich höre nicht auf ihn.
    Was kümmert dich sein Reden!
Ödipus         Was? Dies hören
    und mein Geschlecht im Dunkel lassen? Nein!
    Jetzt oder nie ergründ' ich, wer ich bin.
Jokaste Nein! nein! bei deinem Leben, frag' nicht weiter!
    Genug ist meine Pein.
Ödipus         Ist dir so bang?
    Getrost, ich schände nicht dein Bett und wär' ich
    von Vater her und Ahn' aus Knechtesblut.
Jokaste Und dennoch folg' mir! Lass' dich bitten!
Ödipus         Still!
    Ich folg' dir nicht. Jetzt gilt's zu wissen!
Jokaste         Hör' mich!
    Dein Bestes rat' ich dir.
Ödipus         Dies Beste ist
    mir lange schon zur Qual. Den Hirten will ich.
    Schafft mir ihn keiner?
Jokaste        Unglückseliger!
    erfahre niemals wer du bist.
        (Sie steht starr vor Grauen.)
Ödipus        Ich lass' dir
    die Lust an deinem Blut. Wird einer mir
    den Hirten bringen?
Jokaste (indem sie ins Haus geht) Du Unseliger!
Die Greise (leise)
Die Frau! seht auf die Frau! Ich kann die Augen
nicht sehn, mit denen sie dich ansah. Hast du
die Augen nicht gesehen? Ödipus!
Ödipus Es reiße, was da reißen will! Doch ich
    will wissen, wo ich hergekommen bin,
    und wär' es aus dem Staub. Das Weib ist stolz.
    Mir scheint, sie schämt sich meiner: aber ich,
    ich bin der Sohn des Glücks und Vettern sind mir
    die Monde, die mich groß und klein gemacht,
    die wechselnden. Wer solchen Stammbaum hat,
    der forscht nach seinem Blut.
Die Greise (verschieden)
    Vielleicht bist du das Kind von einem Gott
    gezeugt im Wald mit einer? Ist nicht Pan
    dein Vater? Nicht Apollon? Bacchos nicht?
    Nicht Bacchos? Hat nicht eine von den Nymphen
    am Helikon mit Bacchos dich gezeugt?
Ödipus (ohne sie zu achten, ins Dunkel spähend)
    Das muß der Alte sein! Der Hirte dort,
    den wir erwarten. Überdies erkenn ich
    in denen, die ihn führen, meine Diener.
    Siehst du den Mann?
Die Greise (zusammen)     Er ist es. Dieser ist es.
            (Der alte Hirte tritt in den Schein der Fackeln).
Ödipus Dich frag ich, Fremdling aus Korinth, zuerst:
    ist's dieser, den du meinst?
    (Er zieht in seiner verzehrenden Ungeduld mit der Linken den Boten, mit der Rechten den Hirten dicht vor sich ins volle Licht der Fackeln.)
Der Bote         Derselbe, Herr.
Ödipus (zum Hirten)
    Hör' Alter. Sieh mich an und gib Bescheid
    auf meine Fragen: Du warst Knecht bei Laios?
Der Hirte Sein Knecht, Herr, von Geburt sein Knecht.
Ödipus (in rasender Ungeduld, wendet sein Gesicht jäh von dem einen zum anderen, kaum die Antworten, die er vorauf weiß,     abwartend. Es ist, als risse er in dämonischer Gier das Schicksal in sich hinein wie ein Schwert)
    Was war dein Dienst?
Der Hirte         Meist
    auf dem Kithäron, oder ringsherum,
    Herr, in der Nachbarschaft.
Ödipus         So kennst du diesen?
    (Er faßt den Boten und den Hirten am Nacken und nähert ihre Köpfe einander im grellsten Licht der Fackel, die er durch einen Griff nach dem Arm des Fackelträgers näher herbeizwang.)
Der Hirte Wie sollt' ich diesen – Herr – was ist es denn
    für einer?
Ödipus         Dieser! Dieser! Hast du nie
    mit diesem was zu tun gehabt?
Der Hirte         Nicht, daß ich
    mich des so schnell entsinnen könnte, Herr.
Der Bote Das ist kein Wunder, Herr. Doch frisch ich ihm
    sogleich das Alte auf. Des wird er sich,
    das wette ich, entsinnen, daß vorzeiten
    auf dem Kithäron, wo die Triften sind,
    die großen Weideplätze, daß wir da
    drei halbe Jahre, jedesmal vom Frühjahr
    bis tief in' Herbst hinein, mit unsern Herden,
    er hatte zwei und ich nur eine, daß wir
    da Nachbarn waren und freundnachbarlich
    verkehrten, und zu Winterseinbruch dann
    trieb ich hinab zu meinen Hürden, er
    zu Laios Höfen. Rede ich die Wahrheit,
    ja? Oder nein?
Der Hirte         Ja, ja, nur ist es lange,
    so lange her.
Der Bote          So sage, weißt du's noch,
    wie du das Kind mir damals gabst?
Der Hirte         Was soll das?
    Was fragst du das mich jetzt?
Der Bote         Der hier, mein Guter,
    der ist dies Kind!
Der Hirte         Verflucht sei dir die Zunge
    in deinem Mund!
Ödipus         Ah, Alter, strafe du
    den nicht! Nicht was er redet, was du tust,
    verdient Bestrafung.
Der Hirte         Was, mein gnäd'ger Herr,
    was tat ich denn?
Ödipus         Verleugnen willst du hier
    das Kind, nach dem er sucht.
Der Hirte         Was weiß der Mensch!
    Schad' um die Zeit.
Ödipus         Sagst du es willig nicht,
    so sagst du's doch im Zwang.
            (Er faßt ihn hart an.)
            (Allmähliches Heraufdämmern am Rand des Himmels.)
Der Hirte         Mein gnädger Herr,
    mißhandelst du den alten Knecht?
Ödipus         Heran!
    Schnürt ihm die Hände auf den Rücken fest.
Der Hirte Wofür? Was willst du? Unglückseliger Herr,
    was willst du denn erfahren?
Ödipus         Gabst du ihm
    das Kind?
Der Hirte        Ich gab's. Wär' ich an jenem Tag
    gestorben!
Ödipus         Sterben wirst du heute hier,
    wo du nicht Wahrheit sprichst.
Der Hirte         Und red' ich Wahrheit,
    so sterb' ich auch!
Ödipus (drohend)         Der Alte scheint es, sucht
    Ausflücht' und hält uns hin.
Der Hirte         Ich? Hab' ich's nicht
    schon längst gesagt? Ich gab das Kind! Ich hab'
    es ihm gegeben.
Ödipus         Woher war das Kind?
    Ein eignes? Oder fremdes?
Der Hirte         Freilich war's
    nicht meines. Irgendwo empfing ich es.
            (Fahler Morgen bricht an.)
Ödipus Von welcher Hand? aus welchem Haus?
Der Hirte         Nicht fragen,
    nicht fragen, Herr!
Ödipus         Du bist ein toter Mann,
    wenn ich noch einmal fragen muß.
Der Hirte         So sei's:
    es war aus Laios' Haus, das Kind.
Ödipus         Von Knechten?
    Ja? Oder aus des Königs eignem Blut?
Der Hirte Jetzt bin ich, wo mir graust.
Ödipus         Mir auch, doch hören
    muß ich's!
Der Hirte         Sie nannten es ein Kind von ihm.
    Da drinnen, Herr, dein Weib erklärt dir das
    am besten.
Ödipus        Sie?
Der Hirte         Sie war dabei, als er,
    der alte König, mir es gab.
Ödipus         Es gab?
    Zu welchem Ende?
Der Hirte         Töten sollte ich's.
Ödipus Das Kind? So grausam?
Der Hirte         Grausam war der Spruch,
    Vor dem erbebten sie.
Ödipus         Was für ein Spruch?
Der Hirte Der Knabe würde seinen Vater morden,
so hieß es.
Ödipus         Und du gabst es fort? an den?
Der Hirte Aus Mitleid, Herr, aus Mitleid. Daß er's trüge
    mit sich, in fremdes Land. Doch wenn es du –
    wenn du das bist – ihr Götter der drei Welten –
    so hab' ich für ein gräßliches Geschick
    dich aufgespart, Herr!
Ödipus         Klar! O alles klar!
    O Licht! jetzt seh' ich dich zum letztenmal.
    Verfluchtes Kind! Verflucht im Ehebett'!
    verfluchter Mörder! Ganz und gar verflucht!
            (Er stürzt ins Haus.)
        (Die Greise treten nach vorne. Sie bleiben lange stumm. Dumpfer Lärm im Palast.)
Die Greise Wißt ihr noch, wie er kam? – Gleich einem Gott grüßten wir ihn.
    Herakles! Perseus! Orpheus! So riefen wir, da wir ihn sahn.
    Wie glänzte der Tag: da brachten wir ihm die Königin mit der Krone.
    Wie glänzte die Nacht, da stieg er zu Bette mit ihr.
    Wißt ihr, mit wem er zu Bette stieg? Wehe!
            (Aus dem Palast tönt ein Wehelaut wie ihnen zur Antwort.)
Die Greise Wie konnte das Bett ihn tragen? – Lag nicht der Tote darin?
    Laios!
Alle (dumpf wiederholend)
        Laios!
    Wie lange vergaßen wir den! Nun ist auch er wieder da. Wehe!
        (Eilt gleicher Laut aus dem Palast, noch schrecklicher.)
        (Die Tür des Palastes wird jäh aufgerissen.)
        (Die Mägde kommen hervor.)
Die Mägde Die Königin ist tot!
Eine        Selber –
Andere Mit ihren eignen Händen –
Die Dritte (hängt sich an sie)     Sag' es nicht,
    wie sie's getan hat!
Die Erste (vorne)    Ich war im Gemach –
    dort wo das Ehebette steht – ich lag'
    und reinigte Gerät – da fliegt die Tür auf
    und sie herein, – mich sieht sie nicht – sie sieht
    den Toten, ihren ersten Mann, den König Laios,
    sie redet mit dem Toten – und zugleich
    ist noch ein anderer bei ihr – der Sohn,
    mit dem sie auch in diesem Bette lag
    und Kinder ihm gebar, – dort, wo sie ihn
    geboren hatte, ihn – sie greift – sie greift
    jäh hin und nestelt an dem Gürtel, ah,
    sie macht den Gürtel los und in der Luft
    zieht sie ihn durch, daß eine Schlinge wird,
    ah, ihr Gesicht, als sie sich freute, weil
    es eine Schlinge wurde –
Andere        Sprich's nicht aus!
    Sag' nicht, was dann geschah!
Die Erste        Ich sag' es nicht!
            (Sie verhüllt ihr Gesicht.)
Die Zweite (drängt sich vor)
    Er fand sie dann erhängt, er!
Eine Vierte        Ödipus!
    er kam ins Haus – ich will in meinem Leben
    nie wieder einen laufen sehn mit solchem
    Gesicht, wie er hineinlief!
Die Zweite         Keine Stimme,
    ihr Götter, will ich hören, wie die Stimme war,
    mit der er schrie: Wo ist mein Weib, nein, nicht
    mein Weib, die Mutter! wo ist meine Mutter?
Die Vierte Wir gaben keine Antwort, aber er –
Die Zweite Sein Dämon zeigt es ihm, mit einem Schrei,
    wie hundert wilde Tiere springt er an
    und bricht die Tür – da mußten unsre Augen sehn:
    die Frau da hängen.
Die Vierte         Aus der Schlinge macht
    der jammervolle Mensch sie los und legt sie
    sanft auf den Boden – –
Die Zweite         Und dann nimmt er ihr
    die goldnen Spangen ab, ganz sanft, die Spangen
    vom Kleid, womit es zugeheftet war –
    und redet und wir stehen da und wissen nicht,
    zu wem er redet: zu der Toten nicht,
    und nicht zu uns – allein wir hörens alle:
    »Ihr habt ja nie gesehen«, sagt er, »nicht
    gesehen, was ich tat, nicht, was ich litt,
    niemals gesehn, wer vor mir steht, so schaut
    auch weiter in die Nacht« und hebt, – die Augen,
    zu seinen Augen redet er, – und hebt
    die Hände, beide Hände, mit den Spangen
    und bohrt die Spangen sich in beide Augen,
    in die lebend'gen Augen, bis ihm Blut
    heruntertrieft über die Wangen, über
    das ganze Gesicht!
                (Unruhe im Palast)
Die Erste (wieder vorkommend)
    Sie können ihn nicht halten!
    er schreit, sie sollen öffnen: allem Volk
    den Mann zu zeigen, der erschlagen hat
    den Vater, und der Mutter –
Alle         Sag es nicht
Die Erste (hält sich)
    Mein Mund sagt's nicht!
            (Von innen drängt's heran.)
    (Die Mägde bilden am Tor eine Gasse. Vor Entsetzen und Angst recken sie alle die Arme empor und schließen die Augen.)
(Aus dem Tor kommt Ödipus, mit wildem Haar, die blutenden Augen dürftig verbunden. Er geht mit solchen Schritten, daß zwei, die ihn stützen und führen wollen, ihm kaum nachkommen. Hinter ihm eine Schar von Dienern, auch Gewappnete darunter. – Die Greise weichen schaudernd nach rechts hin.)
Die Greise Ich frage nichts mehr, – ich prüf' es nicht mehr –
    ich bedenk' es nicht mehr – mich schaudert!
Ödipus Ah! Ah! Ah!
    Wo fliegt mein Schreien hin? wer fängt es auf?
    verhallt es in der Luft?
    O Schicksal, wo treibst du mich hin!
Die Greise (flüsternd)
    Zu grauenvollem Tun, das kein Aug' begehrt
    zu sehen.
Ödipus O Finsternis!
    Ewig um mich – unendlich – unausdenkbar,
    unüberwindlich! Namenloses Dunkel!
    Und nochmals Weh! Wie bohren diese Qualen
    in meine Augen und die Dolche innen
    des Denkens!
Die Greise Doppelt ist die Qual: so sind wir
    gebildet!
Ödipus (den Greisen nahe)
        Ah! Du bist noch da, du harrest
    noch bei dem Blinden aus! Weh mir!
Die Greise (zu ihm tretend)
    Furchtbarer Mensch! wer hat die Hand geführt,
    als sie die Augen mordete?
Ödipus        Apollon,
    Apollon hat dies grausenhafte Weh
    mir aufgebaut. Doch mit den Augen wurden
    die Hände da mir fertig. Dazu brauchte
    kein Gott zu helfen. Was soll ich noch anschaun?
    Den Vater drunten, wenn ich ihm begegne?
    oder die Kinder, ihren Blick in meinen
    verschränken und ein unausdenkbares Gespräch
    von Aug' zu Auge führen? Fort mit mir!
    Jagt doch das große Unheil, jagt doch das,
    hinaus, was trieft von allen Himmelsflüchen!
Die Greise (zugleich)
    Ich wollt', ich hätte niemals dich gekannt.
Ödipus (leiser)
    Was ich getan hab' an der Mutter und
    am Vater, büßt Erhängen nicht.
        (Er brütet vor sich hin.)
    Ah! Hochzeit! Hochzeit! nächt'ge Saat, zutage
    gebracht, die Söhne Vaters Brüder, Töchter
    ah, Schwestern! Namenlos! Versteckt mich doch
    im Waldgeklüft! erschlagt mich! Werft mich wo
    ins Meer hinab! Nur schnell! Von wo ihr nimmer
    mich wiederkommen seht! Erniedrigt euch
    mich anzurühren! Fürchtet nichts! Hier drinnen
    ist alle Pein der Welt: es springt nichts über!
            (Kreon, begleitet, tritt aus dem Palaste.)
Die Greise Du bittest, – der entscheiden wird, ist Kreon.
    Er waltet nun des Landes. Er tritt nah.
Ödipus (leise)
    Was rede ich zu Kreon?
Kreon        Ödipus,
    nicht dein zu spotten komme ich, der du elend bist,
    doch ihr, wenn ihr nicht Scheu vor Menschen tragt,
    so scheuet den lebend'gen Gott, der dort herauf,
    der heilige, funkelt, Helios, und zeigt ihm nicht
    dies dort, dies ohne Namen, diesen Greuel,
    vor dem die Erde zuckt und nicht berührt
    will sein von seinem Leib und nicht das Licht
    darf triefen hin an ihn und nicht der Regen,
    die heilig sind. Wir sind sein Blut, auf uns
    liegt dies, in einem Haus mit ihm zu sein,
    und dieses Leiden unsres Bluts zu schauen.
Ödipus O Kreon, du bist gut!
    Mit solcher Güte redest du zu Ödipus,
    dem schlimmen. Ah! gewähre eines! gewähre!
Kreon Um welche Gunst fleht Ödipus?
Ödipus         O stoß mich
    hinaus, nur schnell hinaus, dorthin wo nie,
    nie mehr, mich eine Menschenstimme grüßt!
Kreon Dies wäre schon getan. Doch will der Gott
    zuvor befragt sein.
Ödipus        Nein, nicht mehr befragt.
    Vernichten will er den, der Vaters Blut
    vergoß. Sonst nichts.
Kreon         So sprach der Gott. Doch lag's im Dunkel.
    Nun ist's am Tage. Wer errät den Gott?
    Ich wart' und frage.
Ödipus         Fragen wiederum?
Kreon Nun glaubst du ja den Göttern, Ödipus?
    Wie?
Ödipus         Dies liegt alles nun in deiner Hand.
    Die Leiche drinnen laß bestatten, so
    wie dir's gefällt. Auch das gebührt ja dir.
    Doch das begehre nicht, daß mich die Stadt
    noch länger tragen soll. Nein, im Gebirg,
    dort laß mich hausen, am Kithäron dort;
    der Ort ist mein. Bestimmten mir die Eltern
    am frühen Tag ihn nicht zum frühen Grab?
    Und dennoch weiß ich dies in mir: mich tötet
    nicht Krankheit, noch ein Wurf des widrigen
    zufälligen Geschicks: noch steht ein Etwas
    im Dunkel, ungeheuer, ohne Name,
    für dieses bin ich aufgespart. So gehe
    das Schicksal, welchen Gang es will. O Kreon,
    erbarm' dich meiner Kinder! denkst du's, Kreon,
    sie aßen nie an einem Tisch getrennt
    von mir, sie sind gewohnt, daß dieser da,
    ihr Vater, seinen Bissen teilt mit ihnen!
    Sie nimm in deinen Schutz. Und laß mich sie
    anrühren noch einmal!
        (Auf einen Wink Kreons werden zwei der Kinder, die Mädchen, herausgeführt, zu Ödipus hin.)
Ödipus         Ich höre sie!
    Ich hör' ihr Weinen! Hast du so viel Mitleid,
    Kreon, ist's wahr? Hast du sie mir heraus-
    geschickt?
Kreon         Gedenkend frührer Zeiten, Ödipus,
    und deiner Vaterfreuden tat ich dies.
Ödipus So sei beglückt! Und wahre dich ein Dämon
    auf deinem Weg, der meiner nicht gewahrt.
    Wo seid ihr, meine Kinder! Kommt zum Vater!
    Die Augen sehn euch nicht. Ich hab' sie mir
    herausgeweint – mit meinen Händen da.
    Weh! Mädchen! Bitter! Bitter! Wer nimmt euch
    zum Weibe, wer ist frech genug und schwingt
    die Schmach, die ungeheuere Schmach als Mitgift
    auf seine Schulter? Hängen nicht die Flüche
    der ganzen Welt auf euch! Der Vater schlug
    den Vater tot, dann kam er her und freite
    die Mutter und derselbe Schoß, der ihn
    getragen, trug dann euch, da hatt' er Lust,
    da hatt' er Vaterlust – wer wird aus euch
    sich Kinder zeugen? Keiner auf der Welt!
    Unfruchtbar welkt ihr hin, vergeblich Leben,
    um nichts geboren, öde! Kreon! Kreon!
    Sie haben niemand auf der Welt, nicht tot,
    nein, mehr als tot, zernichtet ist ihr Vater,
    dahin die Mutter, laß sie nicht im Land
    umirren, Fürst, laß sie nicht betteln, Fürst,
    sie sind von deinem Blut. Sie haben keinen
    als dich. Versprich mir dies! Laß deine Hand,
    die Hand anrühren, daß du mir es hältst,
    die Hand dem armen Ödipus. –
Kreon         Genug
    des Weinens. Auf und komm' ins Haus. Ein Dach
    über dein Haupt. Die Sonne steigt.
Ödipus        Weh mir!
    Steigt sie? Nur, daß du mich dann lassest, Kreon,
    daß du mich lassest –
Kreon         aus dem Lande?
Ödipus         Fort!
Kreon Die hohe Gunst erflehe du von Göttern.
Ödipus Weh Götter! Die mich hassen.
Kreon         Sie gewähren's,
    wenn sie dich hassen.
Ödipus          Aber du?
Kreon         Nun geh'
    und laß die Kinder los.
Ödipus         Nein! Nein, die nimm mir nicht!
Kreon Hoffst du noch immer dir Gewinn? Und blieb
    denn etwas treu, das du im Leben dir gewannest?
Ödipus (steigt die Stufen hinan, zu Kreons Hand; oben)
    Thebaner! das ist Ödipus, der groß war
    unter dem Volk und viel beneidet war.
    Drum muß ein Mensch des letzten Tages harren
    im stillen, ganz im stillen.
Die Greise (in sich erschauernd) Ödipus!

Liliparin 'tungo sa berde na hangin
Malaki ang agwat
'Di man abot ng lambat
Sa kalawakan ng ating isip ay maghahangad
Huwag mo nang tanungin pa
Kung bakit silaw sa
Liwanag mo
Sa dinami dami ng tala sa langit ay
Ikaw ang napili ko
Yan ang totoo, mismo
Kahit pa sinong magpapukaw
Ikaw lang ang pipiliin ko

Iba, o iba
Ang aking nadarama
Kapag kapiling ka
Iba o iba
Napapatula
At binibilang ang
Aking mga dalangin
Sana ay yong pakinggan
Ang panalangin ko'y
Mapa sa'yo lang

Ano mang direksyon
Kahit san man tayo mapunta
Basta't kasama ka ay para bang walang problema
Mag-aabang kahit
Mailap man o magalit
'Di hahayaang masungkit ang talang nang-aakit

Maraming nakatingala nagmamasid
Ngunit iisang kislap lang ang bumabalik
Ang halik na galing sa diwata
Nung tinimpla ng tiga Abra yung gayuma
'Di ko maipaliwanag ang
Misteryo nating dalawa't
Pagibig mong kaka-
Iba, o iba
Ang aking nadarama
Kapag kapiling ka
Iba o iba
Napapatula
At binibilang ang

Aking mga dalangin
Sana ay yong pakinggan
Ang panalangin ko'y
Mapa sa'yo lang

Tatlong taong may handog at nasa puting kabayo
Tinahak ang daan galing  kabilang ibayo
Sinundan ang liwanag sa taas at dumayo
Saksihan ang sugo na nagkatawang tao
Nakit parang ang labo labo na
'Di na matanaw at maipinta
Kahit man ganon ay pilit na
Hahanapin ka

Aking mga dalangin
Sana ay yong pakinggan
Ang panalangin ko'y
Mapa sa'yo lang

Ang bituin ay akin
Ikaw lang ang  Polaris ko
(Oh oh oh yeah yeah)
San mang kalawakan ay siyang
Hahanapin ko
(Oh oh oh yeah yeah)
Ang bituin ay akin
Ikaw lang ang  Polaris ko
(Oh oh oh yeah yeah)
San mang kalawakan ay siyang
Hahanapin ko
(Oh oh oh yeah yeah)"

Mike Swift, D-Coy, Alisson Shore, Kiyo, Mark Beats
ALISSON SHORE
Kasama ka sa guest list
Ito ating wish list
Be proud of the mess cos
You dont wanna miss this
Marching to Damascus
And sing told my mama i made it
Magsaka man sa parang
At maraming humarang
Ang ani ay di sayang
Panahon na para
Ang puso ay gumana
Langis sa makinarya
Buckle up
Lilipad na tayo sa Garuda
Wings up
Put your body and your mind
To whatever you desire
Lahat ng nais ay mapasayo
Wag na wag magmadali, pabilog lang ang mundo
Then use the power that you have
To ignite and inspire
Nag iisip kung pano iilaw ang mitsa
Ang hinahanap mong apoy ay nasayo pala
CHORUS:
Di na dapat mangamba
Oh It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
Come what may
Pagkatapos ng ulan ay araw
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
Come what may

MIKE SWIFT
I got money that's waiting
I'm trying to be on time
So nowadays my hustle
Requires me online
Either youtube I edit
In KUMU I rep it
Convert it to G cash
Increase all your credit. //
How should I act during this pandеmic?
My family needs me and the typhoons wreckеd shit..
The person closest to me she's on a death wish. Welcome to the club of problems here's the guest list. //
Time so precious, lived mine reckless. Here's my music, but wheres my message...
I got a lot of these balled up so when def jam called what! . This allstar track is all us.?
Pocket full of dreams
Ready to triple
Peace is the way to make complex simple
If you could relate turn love from hate
Then you already know it's a beautiful day
CHORUS:
Di na dapat mangamba
Oh It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
Come what may
Pagkatapos ng ulan ay araw
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
Come what may

Sandali, Asan ang mga homies? abot na ba pangarap na sinulat gamit lusis, tatawid tayo sa blue seas, di papayag buhay gloomy dapat fruity
Makulay, magaan bonus na kapag medyo goofy. alam mo naman when you need me i am here wag mahihiya sabihin pretty little fears pag pagod ka na palit muna 'ko sa steering wheel Mag adapat maraming nakaready na gears kapag kailangan alam mo san ka kakatok di ka gagaling kapag hindi ka nagpaltos kahit minsan mga tira, baldog, kinapos, kwento mo 'di pa tapos! kwento mo di pa tapos bills wala nang notice
At seeds para sa future deals wala nang tokis everyday dapat may profit sleep kumpleto sulit kapag morning half a cookie beats mula kay markbeats syempre drip, you know we icy , yea!

DCOY
Naging Bihasa sa pag sulat ng talata
At ng Saking pag tanda sa pag balasa ng baraha
Kulang ang tinta ko / sa hawak ko na pluma
Pag kinuwento ko , buhay sa kalye’t pag durusa
Puro Rejection / at sayang na Effort
Kaya Dumiskarte ko tulad ni Jordan Belfort !
At gaya nya nag simula rin sa isang hustle isang tuka!
Na master ko ang pag bangon sa kahit ialng beses madadapa
( Hingang Malalim )
Hustle ulit kinabukasan ...
Walang Angasan purong pag mamahal lang
Saludo sa dalawang hari may suot na corona .. Mukha ko naman ang nasa bundok ng konoha
Ano ba ? sativa ba o indica ?
May label ka o indie ka nasa iisa kuktura ka !
Mag focus ka lang sa tamang direksyon
Samahan nyo kming lumipad sa susunod na misyon
CHORUS:
Di na dapat mangamba
Oh It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day
Come what may
Pagkatapos ng ulan ay araw
It's a beautiful day
It's a beautiful day

Kahit na hindi na tayo tulad pa ng dati na laman ng kalye dahil mga oras natin maluwag
Oo nga eh, Sa na kung pwede lang tayo
Lahat ay bumalik sa ating nakaraan
Makikita mo kung merong nawala na sa ngayon
Mga bagay bagay na di na pwedeng balikan
Makulay ang ganda, ang sarap pag masdan
Makulay ang ganda, ang mga nagdaan
Sa likod ng nilakaran ko, nadala ng kapalaran ko
Bakas ang mga aral, sa ating mga karanasan ngayon natutunan ko
Ang tama at mali teka sandali kamusta na kaya yung iba
Yung iba sikat na, yung iba angat na, yung iba may mga anak na

Kaya parang ba ngayong ay nasabik makasama
Kasi naalala ko ang katambayan sa looban
Kasabwat sa lahat ng pagawa ng kalokohan
Pero merong damayan sa problemang kaharap 
Masarap may kadamay gumaan ang kalooban
Naranasan ko noon teka nasan naba yon
Panahon tayo non tila ba nasa balon
Na punong puno ng alak hawak natin ang timba
Nangingiti ako kasi namiss ko yun bigla
Eh ikaw naman Flict
Uy dello 
Para bang malalim iniisip mo
Ha oo nga
Di ko lang talaga mapigilan na isipin ang mga bagay nato
Ang alin
Yung sana maulit natin ang mga panahon na dati
Wala pang kamalay malay sa mga
Bagay bagay na nagdudulot ng kalungkutan sa isa’t isa
Walang hanggang pag ibig tanging laro ang hilig
Mga kabataan na naglalakbay sa hardin na puno ng himig
Nangangarap na lahat ng bituin ay mahawakan ng aking mga kamay 
At ang mga kabiguan agad kalimutan sa agos ng buhay ay ipatangay
Repeat Chorus
Madaming ng yari taon ang binilang Kajaming kong pare napapangiti lang
Ngayon naalala maulit yun sana

Kahit ano pa mangyari wag kayong bumitaw
Hanggat hindi niyo pa abot lahat ng tala sa taas dahil dahil
Nakaka miss lang kasi
Hindi ko mapigil ang mga ngiti ko pag naalala mga bagay nato
Kaysarap balikan tamis na nagdaan

140,121825068,Walking Distance,Smugglaz feat. Ashley Gosiengfiao,[18],['Hip Hop/Rap'],"Pangarap ko na nung maliit pa kung sino ako
Pag laki
Kaya nag bilang pako ng ilang umaga at
Gabi
Bago ako umabot saking tinatapakan aking pinagdaanan
Ay hindi naging madali kasi tila simputik ng divisoria
Ang guhit ng aking istorya
Sa ginampanan kong papel na bumago saking
Pagka-tao bawat hakbang sa daan
Parang hagdan hagdang palayang kung tinaniman
Ko ng sanhing nagbunga ng maraming pagbabago
Nangapa ko sa dilim kung saan halos pikit mata
Ako na namulat sa makabulag na mundong dikit na sa
Pangalan ko ang lugar kung saan ko sinimulan ang mga
Ipinagpatuloy na hindi ko hinintuan
Mula sa kanto ng delpan hanggang sa buong mundo
Sa bawat kurdon ng mic mapadaloy ang pagka-dugong tondo
Saking ugat ay isa lang naman saking mga hangad na ang katuparang sanay
Maka salubong sa pag-lalakad naglakbay taglay ang talento nyang bigay
Nagpaka-pasaway kung saan tahimik nag ingay ako
Hanggang makilalang taga samin na dating pambato
Na umalis nawala nag-layas nag-gala
Hanggang sa maging pandayo blada

Lakad, lakad, lakad, lakad, lakad lang ng lakad
Lakad, lakad, lakad, lakad, lakad lang ng lakad
Sige lakad lang kahit ikaw nalang mag-isa
Wag mo sabayan ang alon ikaw ang mag dikta
Salungatin anumang dumating basta wag hihinto sa lakad
Kahit aking uliting ukitin muli mga guhit ko sa palad sige lakad lang
Makulay man ang mundo'y ginawa ko lang puti't itim
Ang pagtingin ko na mapansin ko ang liwanag
At dilim sa bawat anggulo ng buhay di man maexplica
Ang larawan ng kinabukasan
Mas lalong nainspira na ibalanse ang mga aral at leksyon
Na nakatago sa mga naranasan kong masamat mabuting mag-kahalo
Na ko't nawala hanggang natutong lumugar
Pati patong tumaya di man marunong sumugal mas lalong nilakihan
Pa ang mga paghakbang tungo sa katuparan sa daan
Kahit pa na maraming hadlang saking kinamulatang lakaran
Ay hindi padin nawalan ng gana o nawalan
Ng pag-asa na sana madala ng chamba
Ang chansa na magising sa pana-ginip na aking dala-ba dala-ba
Dun ako natutong lumakad tumayo sa aking sariling paa ka-hit na natapilok
Natisod nadapa ay pinang hawakan ang makatungtong
Ng tugatog ng walang tinatapakan na iba

Akad, lakad, lakad, lakad, lakad lang ng lakad
Lakad, lakad, lakad, lakad, lakad lang ng lakad
Sige lakad lang kahit ikaw nalang mag-isa
Wag mo sabayan ang alon ikaw ang mag dikta
Salungatin anumang dumating basta wag hihinto sa lakad
Kahit aking uliting ukitin muli mga guhit ko sa palad sige lakad lang
Sige lakad lang
Sige lakad lang
Pa papa papap papapa papapa
Sige lang lakad wag kang papara sige lang lakad ano man ang humadlang
Anggang sa mapanood nako sa mga naging tugon
Ng mga dalangin noon na tinupad ng panginoon
Nakuha na makuntento ngunit hindi na kampante
Kaya bilang pakunswelopatuloy akong umabante
Pagkat
Simula palang ng tunay na laro nakabwelo
Nako kung kailangan mang mamuhay palayo
Titiyaking may puntahan ang mga iiwan kong yapak
Na susundan balang araw sakin ng aking anak
Mga pintuang pinasukan bubong na sinilungan
Mga taong tinulungan ako sa gitna ng ulan
Ang pasasalamat koy ituring nyong bahag hari na mag dudugtong
Sa patutunguhan ko saking pinagmulan
At sa mga duda sakin na pinatunaya na walang bida
Sa pelikulang di hinamak sa umpisa anumang
Layo ng mga pangarap ko sa buhay ang daan papunta doon
Ay para sakin walking distance lang"

Nabubulag din sa tukso
Dapat utak muna, bago puso

Baka mapahiya lamang ako kaya

Masilayan lang kita ay buo na ang araw ko
Lumiliwanag ang mundo

Lungkot ay napapawi napapalitan ng saya
Pag magulo ang isipan ko iyong tinutuwid
Sa makatuwid, ikaw ay gamot pag merong pighati

Gagawin lahat para sayo kahit mahirap pa

Verse 3:
""Sino ba si Maria Clara?""
Yan ang natanong ng
Isang kaibigan ang sabi pa niya'y
Makaluma daw ako at mabuhay nalang sa kasalukuyan
Ang sagot ko naman sakaniya ay ganito po yan
Cleaveage. Pwet, sino ang hindi maaakit dun?
Plus legs, kung may tatanggi, plastik yun
O kaya'y bakla. O kahit na ano, basta
Pag ikaw ay nagmahal siguradong lalabas na
Rin ang iyong pag ka konserbatibo
Kung ika'y maka porno, babalik ka sa batibot
Oo at nakakalibog, talaga si Maria Osawa
Pero ang tunay na lalake'y si Maria Clara
Ang gustong mapangasawa..
Sa ganitong panahon marami ang nagsasabi na wala na
'di ako naniniwala..
Alam kong nasa isang tahanan ka lang hindi ka lang gumagala
Kaya hindi makita
Wala sa eskinita sa gabi
Kaya 'di ka kilala ng mga siga
Andaming sexy baka 'di nga kita mahanap dito
Kasi ikaw yung tipong balot tapos may abaniko
Kanina pa'ko dito, magpakita ka na sakin
Kailangan kita, kinakapos ako sa hangin
Pero kahit maghintay sa paghihirap ay handa
Mabagal ang iyong usad kasi malinis ang bakya
Sa madaling salita, ang lakad ng tulad mo'y hindi marumi
Kaya sa mga bagay na hindi pa naman dapat ay hindi ka nagmamadali
Kasi alam mo kung kailan ang tamang panahon
Ikaw ang hinahanap ko, wala nga ba ako sa tamang panahon?
Drama ko ngayo'y sana'y naisilang na ako noong
Panahong andiyan ka talaga, masaya na sana ako ngayon
Maria Clara, nasan ka na ba?
Lumabas ka na kanina pa ako sa baba nanghaharana"

Pag katabi kita di ako makapagsalita pero di ibig sabihin nun
Na ayaw kita at di kita gusto sadyang kumakaba lang ang damdamin ko
Gusto ko mang sabihin sayo pero ang lakas ng hiya ko
Parang ewan lang
Binibini ng buhay ko handa akong ialay ang
Lahat sabihin mo lang at gagawin ko para lang sayo
Chorus:
Handa akong ibigay lahat ng sa akin
Sayo di di di di ko kayang mawala ka sa akin
Ikaw ang dahilan ng aking paghinga
Sanay habang buhay ka ng makasama pagkat masayo ko sayo
Nag-iintay ng tala
Na daraan sa aking paningin pagkat gusto kong humiling ng
Sana ang pinakatinatangi tanging babae
Na sa akin nakapagdulot ng kakaiba
Sayoy di na mawalay pa
Dahil baka
Di ko kayanin to oowohh
Ikaw ang siyang pinakamakislap na bituin
Para sa akin sinta oooh
At ikaw din ang siyang nagsisilbing matamis na panaginip ko
Repeat chorus
Ikaw ang musikang naglalaro sa isipan ko oooh
Ikaw ang siyang awit ko, sana akoy dinggin mo
Ako ay parang emo kung magdrama
Sayo lang nadama sayang kakaiba
Kung baga ikaw si wendy ako si peter pan
Sanay sumama ka sakin dun sa neverland
Nang mapagsaluhan natin ang pag-iibigan
Na walang katapusang walang hanggan
Ikaw ang nagbigay kahulugan
Sa buhay ko at ikaw ang siyang sa akin nagbigay kabuluhan
Kung bakit ako ipinanganak ng magulang ko
Siguro nga ay para lamang ibigin ang isang
Binibini na nababalutan ng mga anghel sa paligid
At nagdudulot ng sayang nakakaparalisa
Nagpapasalamat ako sa itaas dahil
Pinakilala ka niya sakin
Sana ay di di di ka na niya kunin sakin
Dahil di ko kakayanin

You can stick it I pick it apart cinematography I’m bringing upon the beat
Approach us with hatred accommodating you then you will realize that double S can be something you don’t wanna meet
(Five) Ain’t no way that you leaving alive when I come
(Four) You Voorhees style through the front door
(Three) seconds is all that you got remaining on the clock
(Two) Run cause when it hits (One) you’re done
Got em reading off of the lyrics it’s difficult to follow
When I’m blazing down the interstate a foot upon the throttle
When I splatter the wall with the haemeoglobin and show it off to the public is how
I’m modeling a mottle better get a bigger bottle
To be able to stomach when I decapitate at the capital leaving em captivated
To get a payment or be vindicated for debacles
Gripping a pair of the triggers I’m finna be ripping and tearing the ligaments
Quickly then it gotta be ""Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto""
Y'all better calm down you in need of Tai Chi
Thinking you could ever rip into a track like me
You was asking for it here it is with DNA to be a Tru Lyricist
Doing it lightspeed over the Sprite Beatz
I'm an individual that gets critical with my syllables
I murder you I promise you niggas salute the general
I hit you with this verbal abuse and burn you with chemicals
I murder a nigga then hit em with venom and I get the torch
I'm rapping for Colorado niggas don't wanna get in with me, lyrically chop em like helicopters merk enemies
Smoke in the facility packin heavy artillery, its kind of amusing to see other choppers that envy me
Hit a motherfucker th'end up and run from the hood a bitch
Fuck withn the nigga Loony and the body parked in the ditch
If they really wanna come and get it with the chopper that dump a clip, I fuck with the brainsick cuz I hit you with voodoo
Inside of my brain they say Loony is coo-coo
Assassination, verbally I go through you
You will never catch it, that's how we do the victims
Come up can't throw me a hundred prescriptions
Somebody better told to get away I'm a demon
We cannibal, the house have me (fetty?), no we come feining
A little bit of brain and guts, tell me I'm a heathen
You really wanna meet the chopper? Imma bring in
A lethal mechanic every syllable when I span on you, for spilling it give up
I’m a savage up on this run-through, well intricate spitter cause I kamikaze I’m running through
I’m critical thinking bringing the damage taking this off from you
I seek you niggas hating I’m on it bring it a time or two
Dissolve the competition and after bodies I’m gonna chew
Spit it like I deliver a message what can decide from you
I’m hurting you niggas because nobody heard of you
My kin was taken choose I’m heavily with the rythym
Devour my enemies, I diss all until the end
One of the hardest niggas from the beginning to the finish
I’m a unsigned chopper bitch making you feel it
Getting right back on it i'm murdering my opponents
When you hear me on the record, i'm doing it how i want it
I'm a general, let it, when I spit it I call the shots
And I'm bout to be bodying the nigga up on the lot
I'm articulate but even when i'm stepping in the booth
Imma bullet like a ninja that's giving people the juice
When i'm choppin and Imma be an anomaly come great
Anybody wanna get it can come and meet their fate
I be taking a minute break and bustin' em like a grape
Fully automatic, you niggas are 38s
When I'm stepping on the pedal I'm going a little faster
A lyrical Johnny rocket people calling me Nasa
Poop on these niggas I'm sending love to they master
A legend on the mic and I go to another chapter
Everybody wanna hear it they be looking for the rapture
And I be like, ""Bet"", let me get into the slaughter
Creeping up in the back not gonna believe
That they digging the penmanship
Pulling and bullying niggas
That come but they stopping we did it shoo
Really be going to pull up a battle and not hesitating
To come in to strike in the booth with a nigga they kill the shit
Said I am what I am and I've been
What I've been everyday from the start, my nigga
Living eternally through the dark, my nigga
All on my cutlery be stayin' sharp, my nigga
What'd you think about it, how'd it feel to you?
Kansas city nigga when i hold bill to you
And you gon pay for it, I'mma bring the bill to you
If you try to run away then imma put the steel to you
Do it again, better again every time
Instead of tossing this spitter they would be lying
But you hearin' it go countrywide
Keep bumping Murder Musick until i'm out of my mind
Straight up out the city with no pity, call the witty let him pick you up and lift you like a twister when I spin it
Then I take it to a trip a new dimension with a bitch who suck a dick I spray the pussy when I hit em when I fucking spit it
Take a microphone an automatic gun I'm out to get a pick of chala, start collecting all the blood up and they sacrifice
They body to they windows top above when everybody talking how like they crazy till somebody did it
Now these motherfuckers scared of the real chop, talking all that that bloods and guts and killa but they will not
Talk about they come up from the gutter and they'll kill cops somebody run and everybody fuck around with Spillz squad
Get a pill popped, resolute and I'm filled with adrenaline killin em when I pick a pen and I hit it
Get it real hot, breaking the bitches off of their fucking then I spit, imma throw em like a sizzle in it
Bout to murder with my murder weapon, anybody lurking steppin' in the wrong direction imma serve em heaven
Bout to shot em to the lord I let em up and ready to escort me to the treasure right when someone get em
Dear Lord, since I was a little boy I been a psychopath and muster all around me was a little joy
I tried to play with the all other normal kids but they was looking at me crazy when I start using a ouija board
Are you with me cause the evil that's impending has been taking my ability to really see a figure of me
And so visually I've been in a cemetery looking for a life so distant from my wish that was it
Well this is the darkness, this is the path, this is the underground
Come and step into the legends of my sector and the pistol saying Jimmies I think that it finally went out, bang!

Put me up inside of the booth with all the lights off
Spitting nothing but the truth and I will find y'all
Motherfuckers always talking the shit mane they talking that shit make me pop in the clip this is my fight song
Fuck your bitch and have her weak at the knees
Give her the dick and have her sleeping for weeks
You can prolly smell the pussy on my breath whenever you speaking of me
And if it’s war then fuck bringing the peace!
I got a lot of pride, ain’t afraid to die and I swear to God I’m a lightning rod pointing at the sky up in a thunderstorm
Hear my battle cry, are you scared to die?
You ain’t gotta lie if that’s the case then what the fuck you running for?
I’m a demon, you can feel the fire from Hell coming out of my mouth with every breath that I’m breathing
Sickness is the season, and I won’t stop ‘til I cut their heart out and they’re bleeding
Thinking of making a stang that will make me a couple of billion bucks and get buck as I’m ripping the heart out of the mic and then making it wicked, the poetry working me up
Tell me they ain’t worth a buck
Gonna have to empty your salary for a verse and Donald Trump ain’t even worth enough!
Fuck a fake rapper I will make chapters calling all you motherfuckers fake actors
Disasters of rapture, rip your pussy-ass inside out and backwards…
I’m not here to play kumba ya
(All you have to do is bow down and look into my eyes!)
I’m the product of the Wrath of God!
(Nowhere for you to run and hide, yes, everybody has to die!)

Chop it up with me now, let me hear that spiritual
Ready for the battle really want it?
Gotta drop it on em nam, nam, viet, viet
So stop or me cut ya down, I'll give em the usual
Bloody body leakin' probably did it on the weekend
I'm gone, not, here, here
Crazy motherfucker never to make it up, on my mind fake it till' they make it why are they thinkin' that'd be all right?
Pull the bitch up out em then I leave em at the bottom rottin' fuck it cuz they're fuckin up the game
(Really gotta go and get it) x4 (My time and my pain)
Who's this motherfucker think he is, bone thugs n harmony?
Man, Bonez is trash anyway fuck that mother fucker, (7-0-1)
This is where I'm supposed to rap really fast, and entertain all y'all, y'all fuckin love this bullshit, fuck it I'll play ball
I'm outta North Dakota sick of freezing on the the corner so I took it down to Florida and I hoped you didn't notice
But the money was important we were gonna take it over but we're troubled and we're broken I could see the devil hoping that we'd fall apart and break it down
I'm never gonna take an L I really gotta make it now or take a bow and fade it out
A better way to say it than I really kinda hate it now?
Failed the tox report the fuck y'all talkin bout?
Double time a minute and I keep up with the speed of light, a mothafucka thinkin that he's better to we need to fight?
Takin' it back to the beginnin'
Never gonna get rid of em
Stickin to the story with a needle and some free advice

Packing semen of a demon being a heathen beating seeds in any region making a legion while I'm reading it like I'ma rapping yakkin Charles Manson
While I be given a reason for you to believe in I'm a beast beasting it every season teething and feasting feeding Off beats like I'm treating myself for my own personal satisfaction
Acting up acting out with the action with tactics putting tax on the verses im no freestyler my style isn't free febreezing it fresh with the way that I be serving up the motherfuking murder
When working overtime being a hard worker performing that lyrical serial killer horror Halloween when I'm on the scene making it reality Optimiz Prime sort of like a Transformer
While packing a quarter of dab like a disorder dabbing upon these motherfuckers, swerve
When I hit them with the words merged in a verse converted in a sweet entree serving dessert first
Chopper tongue twisting it with a curve gassing them till it burns I'm that Chopper they warned you about to ask around about me to get to chopping properly and when you ready to pay attention and stay steady and learn
Oh y'all don't see things the way we be seeing the action
Burn the stage down with some TLC like it's left eye playing with some matches
Space shuttle flow from the mo better hold on never will I be a Tech 9 my Rhymes are to Gatling gun
Stunting as the white boy bringin that white noise being a little bit strange when I bang avoiding you average fucks
I be shittin in the booth like a porta potty while rocking a potty mouth dropping two's just to piss out number ones
Staying suited and booted to be a party-pooper when I'm losing my shit because bitch i stay shitting in the club
FINISH HIM
Bigga the nigga the bigga the figgs the godzilla in killin with the syllables drillin em full in any venue when i pull the heater fire breather
Drinking ether by the liter my meter staying full no sleep for the wicked I'm living a dream makin it a reality with a salary with the talent that I was born with like a leader given
Wisdom listen to my ignition Hemi ripping with the cyborg flow with the ambition to slap you bitches out of the bed with a Folgers can to get you to wake up and vision
Us underground choppers on a mission Worldwide Choppers all over the world riding a beat with ease collecting money because that's our motherfucking business
MAD WHITEYYYYYYY

It, is the DNA, the one
That y'all love to speak of
Don't test me on the mic cause I
Will fuck your weak shit up
Open the door! Stepping in looking like I got em all choking some more
Oh it's the lord, of the underground outdoing em with the sick bars and the chorus and it's hard to ignore
The way that I murder these motherfuckers with this lyrical art they adore
You're hoping for another dope DNA verse? Well imma leave their blood all soaked on the floor, like ""don't slip!""
Oh shit, whoop time to get it! Creeping through the dark like it's The Chronicles of Riddick acidic with the spit I can hit it like Alien did it
Mailing a ticking explosive to your mom, she opens the mailbox then BOOM
Blood and guts all over your residence
Then I'm kicking in your door and I'm leaving with dead presidents it's evident
I'm leaving no evidence bipolar off of the medicine beheading them
With the end of the axe blade, you can ask Blade
You little fag vampires get your ass slayed
Marvelous with the tongue twist carving shit
Like a Jack-o-lantern backing into your yard
Accidentally flattening your dog, then I'm
Up in a game with a popular presence
Gonna be here and money irrelevant, gonna be ending your life with a telekinetic sick edicate, never to edit it
Bloody redding em with the blood of the innocent it's a pity it's a minimal effort for me to do it!
Sixteen years got you saying ""aww screw it"" I'm the truest like Double S in the Lyrical Akuma
And the movement is immaculate packing em in the sewer, if they step to us we're set to bust like BANG
It's DNA motherfucker, cherish the name, motherfucker, catch a lyrical aneurysm in your brain motherfucker, I'm
Up in the game and I'm bringing the pain I'm mopping em all and stuffing em all
In the attic attacking and hacking em up into pieces I mean it I'm steaming and eatin em all!

Gotta be kidding me you must be thinking what if I take to the next level
Demonous wicked style guess who's gonna chop it up all the way best?
Chopping through lyrical patterns without a rest, you don't really wanna cover it, step back
You better get out of the way of pro demon it's harder to slaughter it
I'm a fucking beast, listen to my venom I deliver it with a sick
Chopping every syllable with cobra's venom spit
I'm ready for part 6, it's a hardcore revenge bitch
Time to speed it up go in like, Flash can terminate time's fractions and then beat it up
Lightspeed beats supersonic sound but not a big deal, it starts loosing when Interchopper's flowing fluid
Every chopper is gonna be melting, beat rhymes with top speed
And nail it with breaking through speed limits without a rest
Nothing is wrong with my accent, you are just too slow for my word patterns
If you're acting like a chopper chop it like a monster, don't be slow-ass raptor
Kill a beat with a fast flow, it's a burst show, every single time I'm wrecking it fans want me to burst more
I won't be giving a fuck, will just wreck out the track and then top out the fast flow
Combined with a demonous speed it's marked as a top row
Show em lyrical slaughterfest and they think you're a top doe
Taking em over I'm making it harder to catch up with demonous tempo don't mess
Nobody wanna be battling me, step back I'm sick of it - you get it? Check out the rest
Hoping I'm stopping the energy coming from breaking through particles with lyrical flex
You don't really wanna turn it up, Imma be motherfucking blazing your head
(be motherfucking blazing your head) YOU READY?
They don't really wanna 100 when I run on em
Getting in this shit and then I'm twisting like a legend imma put em all up in the coffin
And nail it with the syllables getting out of my tongue
Flowing on lightspeed on Top of the Line beat, no one can put out this fire

HØllÖw ain't fucking around I'm bringing 'em undaground chop
At the top of the choppa roster coming to get your brain popped
When I'm popping em off wit lyrical toxic venomous drops
Then I'm spitting and racking the victims thinking that hØllÖw's on rocks
Leaving the cops checking the blocks when I detonate these bombs
Spitting a boss Holocaust with a nuclear exhaust
Figured they mosh faggot I'm gosh suck a Medusa head of cocks
I'm fucking Pandora and Lemarchand wit the same box
You know that hØllÖw finna wreck it when you bring him on the beat
Like my tongue is made of razors and their cut up when I speak
I leave em laying on a table full of organs when I feast
Then it's Doctor Satan that's taking em over and make these hoes bleed
I spit frost over sheets that target tarnish your heat
And lead you all to the peak of lyrics carved in the beat
I know it's often I reap a rapper talking wit speed
And when it's dark I'm the werewolf Shepherd guarding my sheep
And I ravage through getting shot bullet silver man or not
Ramming poon from your thot fuck her make her pussy rot
Get a crew get some Glocks you're never gonna fuck wit us
Your homies thinking ya spitting it hot till I run through and chop
Like how many gonna be bringing it when I'm coming and spitting it belt fed?
Hopping on top of the track and coming to rip this shit like Sprite said
HØllÖw be doing that crap and you know I'm throwing that shit that melt Fed's
Verbally heated I'm popping a clip and leaving on your death bed
DNA recommend finna bring up the choppa that helped shed
Lighting up onto the comet that's soaring infected ready to bring death
It's plaguing em all when I'm spitting up on it  y'all know I don't need breath
It's hØllÖw popping up on em wit the undaground chop shibboleth
Focus on my lyricism how it give my flow precision
Mix it wit my tho'd condition Ouija boards and soul addiction
Then you got my full attention anatomic x-ray vision
Looking through your composition smell your fear and high contrition

Sprite Beatz me zvao da mu pomognem na traci koju čuješ
Da ju razvalim sa svom svojom snagom, mic-a da se domognem i pljunem
Sada mjeriš se u ovome sa klasom, zato stani u red
Poput papiga se ponavljate, nije samo par vas
Jedete mi prašinu kada ubrzam, stanem na gas
Lav i blizanci protiv vuka, ovo crvena je svadba
Ostajete bez vrata
Jedan slog pauze za mene da dođem do zraka
Samo djelić sekunde tako da nastavljam da bacam
Magic-ova rima više neće biti sama
Sad je stigla smrtna bolest sa Balkana
Ako riječi ne znaš izgovarat, nisi ti za ovu stvar
Brate, sigurno to znaš, još da bacim jedan bar
Bez da stanem i grabim zrak, underground-a ja sam kralj
KUGA vas pretvara u prah
Choppanje na hrvatskom je puno teže
Za mene to nikad nisu barijere
Nek je amerima lako slagat rime
Ipak jurim ovom trakom kao Barry Allen
Šta da kažem, koju posluku da poram
Neovisno, od vas moram uvijek ispred biti jedan korak
Fora nije kad je moja konkurencija prespora
Za tebe sam noćna mora, da me stigneš si primoran
Stoga ubijam sve redom ko od Kendricka ""Kontrola""
Uvijek odlazim u napad sve dok ne dođem do gola, bolan
Jedem ovaj mikrofon, tretiram ga ko hrana
Svi su mi nakrivljeni, znači nitko mi nije ravan
Saitama-san sam, samo super stvari stvaram
Stari, hladan kao bura, trakom sada haram
Došo sam do kraja, zar ja nisam kren'o tek?
Zapeo je text, who's next?!

Now you dealing with a spitter that can chop it like a veteran
So if you wanna go to war I'm showing who I'm better than
I'm feeling militant and you don't wanna hear the truth about me topping your favorite it's hard to swallow like it's cinnamon
I gotta be the one to pick on a wannabe
Man, I'm sicker than high degrees
Like a doctorate
So I'm proper with chopping like a surgeon
You don't wanna give me the urge to purge
Because I'm rich with words and you're broke
You can hit the curb and get smoked
Like I hit the herb but you choked
I don't think you wanna be the victim
When I pick up the pen and I pick on the enemy
Hitting the level to rip it I'm flipping
A sentence for the wickedest ending
So if you're lucky to be getting the remedy
I'll get ticking to blast off
And ripping your mask off
Ridiculous with it you think I'm tripping off bath salts
And when you get to break it down, you getting the cast off
Because you're not limited
But can you keep up to speed?
I don't really think you wanna see
You getting served like hot cup of tea
When you try to get the legitimate rhythm and delivery I'm finna be ripping the track and I let it burn like a sinner be
Get it cooking like dinner be
When I flow it's going colder than winter be
So be ready to back away when I get to chopping I'm dropping anybody that is looking like an enemy
Nobody wanna gimme the mic cause they know I slaughter
Like a father protecting daughters
They thought I was like a problem
Well I am when it come to chopping
I get em in a million pieces
Easy
Or Im'ma double em up get em beat like I'm Breezy
Then I gotta find a spot to hide the rotten body
So I look into the underground and find I gotta drop a lotta
Rappers on the radio not rocking hotter topics
Try to stop us but find that you'll slaughtered by the choppers
 
Questo cannone con il fumo l'ho già condito
Ho le parole del futuro come John Titor
Vogliono sollevare mura, vaffanculo la dittatura pure quando diventa dura io non sto zitto
Cambia corrente di pensiero quando ti senti sovrappeso
Si può tornare più leggero come il sottoscritto
Come un rapace dal cielo, so che sono capace davvero di portare la pace dentro ogni conflitto
Sensei è il nome del pazzo, mentre il tuo mixtape ha un nome del cazzo
Non è facile rappare tutte le strofe che faccio
Tiro calci nelle palle proprio come nel calcio
Non ho mai elemosinato, determinato
Mi sento sempre rinato
Senti il piano che ho escogitato
Non mi sono demotivato, per quanto mi sono allenato
Vi sembro velocizzato in prima linea perchè non rimango di lato
Di perfetta comprensione, sparo parole calibro nove
Mitragliatore di precisione, faccio la musica di professione
Non mi interessa la protezione delle persone con la pressione e la propensione a camminare per ore come dentro una processione
Partorisco 'sta canzone tipo immacolata concezione
Scrivo il prossimo disco in chiesa e lo chiamo ""La mia confessione""
Con l'ossessione di sapere perchè a scuola ero un po' secchione
Della mia vita sono l'attore ma non seguo nessun copione (Brr) Freschi, conservo tutti i testi in frigo
Sono un tipo recidivo, con questo rap ci vivo
Discorsi veramente così complessi che non reggi il filo
Non ti fa diventare sexy un bel vestitino
Prima di fare tutto questo dovresti fare la gavetta
Provengo da un altro pianeta come il principe Vegeta
Io non ho fisico d'atleta, mi sono mangiato la mia fetta
E siccome il tempo non aspetta rappo come una macchinetta

Let's get it started on the mic I go retarded and my skills are sharper then the teeth that's on a walrus
I'm creeping like a goblin like I'm deep from out the forest and I just finished eating on your carcass sneaking in your closet hiding secretly I'm watching then I'll jump out yelling peekaboo you see me and you sharted
Cut your chest open and then I'm reaching for your heart and imma squeeze it and just squash it cuz your week when you be chopping
You're easily forgotten, you need to put a sock in it you think you be rocking it but it's obvious not a bit nobody's looking for your music you do not exist as an artist that is not a fib it's true better swallow it
I'm not the fastest but indeed my speed is solid as the skin that's on that mutant I believe his name's Colossus
When I get on a instrumental I Kamehameha it, kamikaze bomb it
Demolish and abolishing everything like a catastrophic comet
Beasting like a preacher and my physical gets altered resulting that I turn into a horrifying horror with some horns on my head got the people thinking I'm demonic
Raining on you dropping I remain to stay a problem for you lames who think you're rocking when I take away your stardom
You were never entertaining and you never been creative in any type of way because you are not
They call me VBL the wizard Lord bronze a magician when I'm spittin I am a lyrical Warlock
I'm just getting warmed up I haven't even begun performing when I put a show on it benefits with endorphins that my body's absorbing it's like I'm being rewarded with Infinite Energy filling
Immortal I'll turn to scorpion like a get over here and then you're a goner after the torture when I scorch ya and I'm not feeling remorseful

Bitch i'm the true definition of lyricism by benificial we drop on and chopping up instrumentals
I'm bout to stop by the populars rocking it when i'm spittin' and possibly bout to lock up and i spark imma kill a killer
My speed i riddle a meaner for dinner for being a 3, pick up a pen and then imma battle em hitting the niggas that wanting to be
Spitting a hollow rythym in hell bet they not talking shit with the vest, wanting the loosening with the flex, taking a skittle away a list
With the mili when i hear the beat i go knee deep, with the flow, I'mma pull a Road Runner, beep beep
Competition they don't really wanna see me, prone to catch a body when i pivot in these heat streets
From the coast shout out to a local MC, B, imma need it in the game i thought i had a cheat sheet
Run it like a pair of cleats, flier than a parakeet, you sleeping on a sleeping giant it's time to let the beast freak
Imma be getting it buck when niggas step up on the scenario, spitting the venom i'm sending 'em into their burial
Bring in another bug imma shit on the stereo, undaground choppers 6 Fix nigga here we go
Straight up call me legendary, taking it on my adversaries, giving a fuck who's coming to buck, i shoot em my vocabulary
Gimme the mic and i'm bout to drive it all up they have to worry cause i'm keepin it G a nigga not even in my category
Bout to take it to another level with the hustle gang murder for the fame i just wanna come out balls and chains
Spitting with the flame on the microphone i'm bringing the pain you'll be the last come put up with me and end the story
I don't wanna do is try to up come up from a cell ho, fucking with the steel i wreck your side don't want to 
No one got a stale flow, chopping up my shell tone, trauma that bout it to chop it on the mic on people's elbow"
155,134311820,Binibini,Curse One,[18],['Hip Hop/Rap'],"Authors signal blank space, claiming Buck Rodgers
Say the same shit in L.A., and let them duck Dodgers
Every breath is like I come up from the water submerged in Alphabet soup, this loop is a spoon
I use to take scoops I loot this brain fruitfully
Bootlegged perusers rap to reign truthfully
Used to scrabble on late notes
Now I let my pen ice skate on the back of these bank notes
Check the dictation over the sound of these navotes
If a rapper falls off in the jungle there's no hope
When there's nobody heard, you can hear the town die in the back of an alleyway, homie, the strong survive
Rock a chain made of beer-tabs
Drinking after heavy nights, I'm blinking in the distance on the oncoming headlights
Walk the road or the road walks you
You ain't a special motherfucker, put your blimp in a zoo
I'm saying, tame your big head for the lazy men and laymens
I don't deal in terms below mine, so pay attention
To the justified shine, no mention of mine, kid, cause, I'm just here for the pension and prime rib
I'm self made, DIY to consign me, to half them label wars, you can say I'm a wise bitch
There's no identity and they like it
Now I'm having indie knobs say, ""That ain't bad for a white kid...""
Your horse is too damn high, just like the rent
Sounds like you need an extra friend to harvard your dent
I'll take you down a couple notches like a Thanksgiving dinner
When I attack, run cooler than Jamaicans in the winter
Yul Brenner: There's nothing wrong with I see, it's about what you see, now look in the mirror, and tell me again, what you see

Ay Coach, I'm hoping a study-day approach i'm holy high on these mountains eagle this eye dali pray
The humans divide and procreate
Pros chose to decide this guys fate, since i's about five-eight
Inhabited mystic, art god, or all ballistic
I can't even see myself, and this shit is still narcissistic-KHHHH
So go source when force is fuck wittable, course-load, accounting for seven chakras the intervals box out
You cock dribbling bubble-fucks, I thunk in, triple-double, tu fumbling yup
I troublesome sun-king
He ran away from proud rock in fear of that one thing, scars will get passed, gas that stunt with a bum wing
Bitch, hakuna-matata, cumma hadouken, summa cum laude, the party or some will come later, but we get it started
Cause summer comes once again
School came when God shot at the fall, I'm scorpion-born
Love scorn, I claim retarded, and go in
Hard never home, dearly departed
Orbiting, ours merkaba god, fuck Harvard
In suits I look garbage
I'm sorry, like new artist
But almost all of you awfuls should of died, when I said so last
Now heads roll, professional masked killer
Will is feral, when I go fast til' a boat with no motor
Adrift in a space lake, lifted in space based, base
Hastily wasting his grace on mahasabha taste
And if I moderation to follow a night
Bidibing, plan of my formidables, style fight
Dictionary dicks depict the sicker shit than they can ever be and be triumphant
On top, Ong Bak a nigga trumpet
Knee-caps and elbows, to skull caps, and pell-hose, on Rodeo, on Melrose, aw hell no...
Red fur impersonating Elmo, but this my world, Lalala, Lalalalalala
Lalala, LAAAAAUHHHHHHGH-

No that's going to fuck it up!

156,143909290,2Am,Kris Delano,[18],['Hip Hop/Rap'],"Alas dos ng madaling araw, antok di pa dumadalaw
Magpabaga ng damo sabay ng basong umaapaw
Isang lunok, isang buga, layo sa mga mababaw
Ang aking destinasyon, sa bagsakan ng bulalakaw
Pakinggan mo ang hiling
Sa dami ng problema ng mundo, ako dapat ang alisin
Panalanging malayo sa tao na mapag angkin
Kanya kanya ang galaw pano pa mapapansin
Ugaling peke, pekeng kanin, dami ng fi-finesse
Basta ba may benepisyo, ay tsak ang bibilis
Manlalamang ng kapwa pang sariling interest
At pagtapos makatapak, magpopost ng feeling blessed (yuck!)
Teka, nakaka walang pasensya
Walang kalma, nasobrahan ng papuri sa tenga
Sa mundong mapang mata, nabulag ka sa pera
Matuto kang makuntento, wag pagapos sa kadena

Ano bang mapapala
Sa problema mong dala
Ano bang mapapala
Walang mababa sa mapungay na mata
Ano bang mapapala
Sa problema mong dala
Ano bang mapapala
Walang mababa sa mapungay na mata
Imbis na mang boka, isinde mo yan ng Doja
Mag bingi-bingihan sa mga mahihilig mangontra
Ang kikitid mga utak, daig pa mga chismosa
Kung makapag salita, kala alam ang iyong story
Mga feeling, at sasabihin
""Wala kang kwenta, puro kwento"" ang kikitid
Sa trending ay naging alipin, mga mali rin
Kung hindi mo ko magets, wag ako sisihin, isipin
Di tayo magka ere, bawal dito peke
Magkaiba ng isip, hindi ka dito pwede
Kaya tigilan niyo ko peste
Buhay ko hindi librong bukas, hindi teleserye
Teka, pahingi munang pasensya
Kalmado lang ako saking alak usok at pera
Sa mundong mapang mata, kinulang ata sa tenga
Matuto kang makinig, wag pagapos sa kadena

Ano bang mapapala
Sa problema mong dala
Ano bang mapapala
Walang mababa sa mapungay na mata
Ano bang mapapala

Put my cross hairs on them

May isang marikit na dalagitang nang aakit
Dikit pa ng dikit sa akin ng biglang lumapit
Binigyan ako ng candy shit bibig ang gamit
Sabi nya tigasan ka? puso ko ay tumalon
Di ko kase alam kung utos ba yon o tanong
Sakit sa ulo bumukol ang maong kong pantalon
Nasasabunutan ang kagubatan kong balbon
Dise-otso ka na miss ang bilis ng panahon
Edi buka na ang nakapikit mo na tahong
Basag narin ako sa doobie at nakainom
Kaya unti unting nahulog sa munti nyang patibong
Kinandado ang pinto at sinarado ang bintana
Anong gagawin mo pag ikaw na ang niyaya
Alangan naman tumanggi ka pa sa biyaya... (Hala tihaya)

Pagkagising ko nakita ko sarili ko nasa sahig ako
Pano nga ba ako nakatulog kaninong banig ito
Wala naman akong ibang maalala
Nasan na kaya yung dalagang nakilala kagabi kase pati pitaka ko wala na
Tayo'y magkikita pa kaya sa may ubasan
Sana nandun ka mamaya
Tagu-taguan, maliwanag ang buwan sa may ubasan
Wag na wag...wag na wag kang mawawala

Papunta ka na ba? sana
Kase kung mawawala ka nakakawalang gana
Laliman pa natin ang ating pagkakakilala
Bilangin ang mga bituin habang nakahiga
Sa damuhan dun sa may ubasan
Kung may dala kang ube dyan ayos yan
Magka-uri lang naman ang kulay nyan
Di kita iiwan sa ere kahit pa magkahulihan
Kahit na basahan mo pa ako ng tarot
Walang dahilan para sakin matakot
Pakinggan nalang natin ang paghampas ng alon
Sa lakas, ramdam mo yung paghiga ni Hatton
Muntik na nga kong masiraan ng bait
Ngayon ganun pala ang lasa ang pait
Impyerno at langit naglapit mga guhit guhit
Ding ding na pantig pantig
Perpekto ang pagkakabit kabit

Pagkagising ko nakita ko sarili ko nasa sahig ako
Pano nga ba ako nakatulog kaninong banig ito
Wala naman akong ibang maalala
Maliban sa ngiti na nagmula sa mukha nya alas-sinko pasado ng umaga
Tayo'y magkikita pa kaya sa may ubasan
Sana nandun ka mamaya
Tagu-taguan maliwanag ang buwan sa may ubasan
Wag na wag...wag na wag kang mawawala

Kumusta ka na? bumangon
Nasan ka ngayon, umaraw umulan
Libre ako para sayo alam mo yan
Kase mukhang wala ka namang panahon
May pag asa pa kayang mapatingin ka sa akin
Hanggang san ba ako dadalhin nang pagiging mahiyain
Ti-tigas lang ako ikaw ang kumagat
O maglaro nalang tayo sa pamagat

Bumibiglang liko dahil tao lang kame
Buhay binata na parang walang mga pake
Kaibigan natin ang dilim wag kang matakot sa gabe
Di lang ikaw nakaitim marami tayong kakampe
Baka pwedeng makatikim wag kang madamot sa karne
Gusto mo rin magpadiin wag ka na ngang maginarte
Madaling araw na naman kame natapos kagabe
Napakarami kaseng nais magpakamot ng kate
Alam kong may lakad ako pero  papatatakbo ako'y patungo sayo
Madaling araw na namn kame natapos kagabe
Napakarami kaseng nais magpakamot ng kate

Pagkagising ko nakita ko sarili ko nasa sahig ako
Pano nga ba ako nakatulog kaninong banig ito
Wala naman akong ibang maalala
Abang abang nalang sa susunod pang kabanata- matanong ko lang sana

Tayo'y magkikita pa kaya sa may ubasan
Sana nandun ka mamaya

Wag na wag...wag na wag kang mawawala
Tayo'y magkikita pa kaya sa may ubasan

Parinig naman ng rap mo! sample naman d'yan
Ang ganda naman ng cap mo! arbor nalang yan
Ang yabang mo naman! wala ka bang kanta na bago?
Bakit wala kang battle? Takot ka bang matalo? Ha?
Paulit-ulit ang tanong ng mga tao
Wag sanang apurado, anong magagawa ko?
Wala akong maisip, masyado pang mainit
Akala mo tuloy mukhang suplado pag tahimik
Pagod lang talaga, galing gig Tuguegarao
Walong oras sa van, tatlong oras sa kalabaw
Tapos pag uwi ko pa para bang hindi ko malaman
Kung bakit ang buhay ko ay para bang naging pelikula
Laging puyat! Nagkalat ang papel na nilamukos
Andame ng kapeng ipinautos
Tinta ng aking bolpen, malapit ng maubos
Isang patak na lang pero aking ibubuhos

Mali ba na magkamali ang 'sang tulad ko
Ako ay tao lang din naman na tulad mo
Ano ba ang dapat na gawin
Dapat bang kamuhian o dapat ba na tularan ang 'sang tulad ko na tao lang
Pasensya na, tao lang
Pasensya na, tao lang
Pasensya na, tao lang

Sapul sa pagkabata, sablay nung tumanda
Lumakad humakbang hanggang sa madapa
Wag kang mawawalan ng pag-asa, wag kang madadala
Kung wala ka pang mali wala ka pang nagagawa
Madadapa ka muna bago ka matutong lumakad
Ang buhay ay utang, hulugan ang bayad
Kaya wag kang matakot magkamali
Pero alalay lang wag kang masyadong magmadali
Yan ang sabi sa akin ng aking itay
Na pinapaalala palagi sakin ni inay na kadalasan ay
Hindi nasusunod
Ayoko ng sumali, gusto kong manuod
Minsan wala ng gana, ayoko ng mag Rap
Kase akala ko dati, alam ko na lahat
Yun pala kulang pa ang kaalaman kong labis
Ngayon alam ko na kung ba't may pambura ang lapis

Mali ba na magkamali ang 'sang tulad ko
Ako ay tao lang din naman na tulad mo
Ano ba ang dapat na gawin
Dapat bang kamuhian o dapat ba na tularan ang 'sang tulad ko na tao lang
Pasensya na, tao lang
Pasensya na, tao lang
Pasensya na

Pero di ba tao ka lang din, hindi mo ba napansin?
Kahit anong taas mo na, titingala ka pa rin
Kahit planuhin mong mabuti, bakit ganun pa din?
Di maiwasan na magkamali kahit anong gawin
Kadalasan, nangyayari ay ang kabaliktaran
Marami kang detalye na makakaligtaan
Mamamali ka ng daan lalo kung wala kang g'anong alam
Ano magagawa mo? Tao ka lang
Napapagod, natatakot, naiinip
Natatawa, nagtataka, naiinggit
Nangangawit, nagagalit, nabibigla
Nalulungkot, nauutot, nahihiya
Natutukso, nakukonsensya, nauubusan din ng pasensya
Nasasaktan, nagmumura pero nagmamahal pa rin kahit natuto na

Mali ba na magkamali ang 'sang tulad ko
Ako ay tao lang din naman na tulad mo
Ano ba ang dapat na gawin
Dapat bang kamuhian o dapat ba na tularan ang 'sang tulad ko na tao lang
Mali ba na magkamali ang 'sang tulad ko

Kahit mag tago ka ng mabuti’y aking mahahanap
Tinig ng batang probinsyano ay mapalaganap
Di ko man inakala na kahit na sa hinagap
Ay mapapakinggan kahit na minsan
Pag kakataon na ayaw kang bigyan

May humatak man sa likod harap ang tingnan
Pero huwag kalimutang mag pasalamat sayong mga nakatuwang
Kahit na makalamang

Baon kami sa utang kahit na atenista
Wala akong talento hindi rin ako guwapo
Pero tangina nila di ako nag patalo
Bakit ko papansinin kung san sila lamang
Tututukan ko nalang kung san ko kayang galingan
Hindi patas ang laban pero sandali lang
Wala namang nag sabi na pantay pantay ang ating dadaanan

Ng pagod mabigo tumino saktan, na nagtulak sakin alamin
Ang kaya pa marating ng sulatan at kada hinaing
Lalong gumaling nung kala mo napuruhan sa

Mahirap habulin pag tayo magkasama

Diretso lang ang tingin wag ka ng lumingon
Isipin mo na ;ang ito ang daan papunta sa ating prusisyon
Pagmamahal na walng kundisyon
Maglalakbay at sasabay kahit na nakaposisyon
Mga harang na di maisantabi, sa isang tabi
Kabilang parte naman nito malabo na mapaghiwalay nila
Kame wala silang pake

Basta kasama ka kumpleto na ang aking araw
Tara sabay nating tingnan ang paglubog nang haring araw
Hawak ang kamay nakadantay pa walang makakaagaw
(walang iba-wlang iba ikaw lang at ako)
Tara sabay nating tingnan ang paglubog nang haring araw
Hindi ko na namalayan na inabot na pala ng madaling araw
Parang kanina lang ay nagba bye paalis ang haring araw
Hanggang bukang liwayway kumaway kahit ang tulog ay mababaw
Ulo mo saking balikat inabutan ng pagsikat ng haring araw (kasama ka)"

Nagmana daw ako sa aking tatay
Di ko lang alam kase di ko pa sya nakita
Natutunan mga bagay kahit 'di nya ko sinanay
Sikap para sa tinapay, araw-araw bagong silang
Kita saking palad, sama-sama kung gumapang
Kasangga ko ay walang iba kundi sarili ko
Alam ng salamin kung ano ang pangako ko
Saking sarili, gusto  kong lumipad
Aking ipilit, gusto kong sumigaw
Daming gustong sabihin, pero wag nalang
Pero wag nalang, pero wag nalang

Gusto ko  maklabay
Gusto ko tumakbo papalayo sa lahat
Gusto ko mamatay
Pero bawal pa, si ina'y malulumbay
Tagal ng friday night, gusto ko na malaman
Kung may bagong episode, ang aking inaabangan
Oh kaya naman, tumambay maglakad, kung
Saan man ako dalhin ng mga paa ko sa lansangan
Ako'y isang halaman, ako'y isang halaman
Bigyan mo ako ng oras, hayaan mag-isa
Hindi maganda ang bukas kung iyong ididikta
Sa akin ay gusto kong ipinta
Kung ano ang buhay at mga kulay ayon sa akin nakikita
Kaya kung may problema bahala ka na dyan
Ayoko mag-isip pwedeng bukas nalang yan
Kasi wala na kong pake
Wala na kong pake, wala na kong pake, wala na akong pake
There ain't no day, that I won't live my way
Come what may, Come what may
Let me and my music drift away
Hindi araw araw masaya

Halika't sumama ka

 L. Domitio Ap. Claudio consulibus, discedens ab hibernis Caesar in Italiam, ut quotannis facere consuerat, legatis imperat quos legionibus praefecerat uti quam plurimas possent hieme naves aedificandas veteresque reficiendas curarent. Earum modum formamque demonstrat. Ad celeritatem onerandi subductionesque paulo facit humiliores quam quibus in nostro mari uti consuevimus, atque id eo magis, quod propter crebras commutationes aestuum minus magnos ibi fluctus fieri cognoverat; ad onera, ad multitudinem iumentorum transportandam paulo latiores quam quibus in reliquis utimur maribus. Has omnes actuarias imperat fieri, quam ad rem multum humilitas adiuvat. Ea quae sunt usui ad armandas naves ex Hispania apportari iubet. Ipse conventibus Galliae citerioris peractis in Illyricum proficiscitur, quod a Pirustis finitimam partem provinciae incursionibus vastari audiebat. Eo cum venisset, civitatibus milites imperat certumque in locum convenire iubet. Qua re nuntiata Pirustae legatos ad eum mittunt qui doceant nihil earum rerum publico factum consilio, seseque paratos esse demonstrant omnibus rationibus de iniuriis satisfacere. Accepta oratione eorum Caesar obsides imperat eosque ad certam diem adduci iubet; nisi ita fecerint, sese bello civitatem persecuturum demonstrat. Eis ad diem adductis, ut imperaverat, arbitros inter civitates dat qui litem aestiment poenamque constituant.
 His confectis rebus conventibusque peractis, in citeriorem Galliam revertitur atque inde ad exercitum proficiscitur. Eo cum venisset, circuitis omnibus hibernis, singulari militum studio in summa omnium rerum inopia circiter sescentas eius generis cuius supra demonstravimus naves et longas XXVIII invenit instructas neque multum abesse ab eo quin paucis diebus deduci possint. Collaudatis militibus atque eis qui negotio praefuerant, quid fieri velit ostendit atque omnes ad portum Itium convenire iubet, quo ex portu commodissimum in Britanniam traiectum esse cognoverat, circiter milium passuum XXX transmissum a continenti: huic rei quod satis esse visum est militum reliquit. Ipse cum legionibus expeditis IIII et equitibus DCCC in fines Treverorum proficiscitur, quod hi neque ad concilia veniebant neque imperio parebant Germanosque Transrhenanos sollicitare dicebantur.
 Haec civitas longe plurimum totius Galliae equitatu valet magnasque habet copias peditum Rhenumque, ut supra demonstravimus, tangit. In ea civitate duo de principatu inter se contendebant, Indutiomarus et Cingetorix; e quibus alter, simul atque de Caesaris legionumque adventu cognitum est, ad eum venit, se suosque omnes in officio futuros neque ab amicitia populi Romani defecturos confirmavit quaeque in Treveris gererentur ostendit. At Indutiomarus equitatum peditatumque cogere, eisque qui per aetatem in armis esse non poterant in silvam Arduennam abditis, quae ingenti magnitudine per medios fines Treverorum a flumine Rheno ad initium Remorum pertinet, bellum parare instituit. Sed posteaquam nonnulli principes ex ea civitate et familiaritate Cingetorigis adducti et adventu nostri exercitus perterriti ad Caesarem venerunt et de suis privatim rebus ab eo petere coeperunt, quoniam civitati consulere non possent, veritus ne ab omnibus desereretur Indutiomarus legatos ad Caesarem mittit: sese idcirco ab suis discedere atque ad eum venire noluisse, quo facilius civitatem in officio contineret, ne omnis nobilitatis discessu plebs propter imprudentiam laberetur: itaque esse civitatem in sua potestate, seseque, si Caesar permitteret, ad eum in castra venturum, suas civitatisque fortunas eius fidei permissurum.
 Caesar, etsi intellegebat qua de causa ea dicerentur quaeque eum res ab instituto consilio deterreret, tamen, ne aestatem in Treveris consumere cogeretur omnibus ad Britannicum bellum rebus comparatis, Indutiomarum ad se cum CC obsidibus venire iussit. His adductis, in eis filio propinquisque eius omnibus, quos nominatim evocaverat, consolatus Indutiomarum hortatusque est uti in officio maneret; nihilo tamen setius principibus Treverorum ad se convocatis hos singillatim Cingetorigi conciliavit, quod cum merito eius a se fieri intellegebat, tum magni interesse arbitrabatur eius auctoritatem inter suos quam plurimum valere, cuius tam egregiam in se voluntatem perspexisset. Id tulit factum graviter Indutiomarus, suam gratiam inter suos minui, et, qui iam ante inimico in nos animo fuisset, multo gravius hoc dolore exarsit.
 His rebus constitutis Caesar ad portum Itium cum legionibus pervenit. Ibi cognoscit LX naves, quae in Meldis factae erant, tempestate reiectas cursum tenere non potuisse atque eodem unde erant profectae revertisse; reliquas paratas ad navigandum atque omnibus rebus instructas invenit. Eodem equitatus totius Galliae convenit, numero milium quattuor, principesque ex omnibus civitatibus; ex quibus perpaucos, quorum in se fidem perspexerat, relinquere in Gallia, reliquos obsidum loco secum ducere decreverat, quod, cum ipse abesset, motum Galliae verebatur.
 Erat una cum ceteris Dumnorix Aeduus, de quo ante ab nobis dictum est. Hunc secum habere in primis constituerat, quod eum cupidum rerum novarum, cupidum imperi, magni animi, magnae inter Gallos auctoritatis cognoverat. Accedebat huc quod in concilio Aeduorum Dumnorix dixerat sibi a Caesare regnum civitatis deferri; quod dictum Aedui graviter ferebant, neque recusandi aut deprecandi causa legatos ad Caesarem mittere audebant. Id factum ex suis hospitibus Caesar cognoverat. Ille omnibus primo precibus petere contendit ut in Gallia relinqueretur, partim quod insuetus navigandi mare timeret, partim quod religionibus impediri sese diceret. Posteaquam id obstinate sibi negari vidit, omni spe impetrandi adempta principes Galliae sollicitare, sevocare singulos hortarique coepit uti in continenti remanerent: metu territare: non sine causa fieri, ut Gallia omni nobilitate spoliaretur; id esse consilium Caesaris, ut quos in conspectu Galliae interficere vereretur, hos omnes in Britanniam traductos necaret; fidem reliquis interponere, iusiurandum poscere, ut quod esse ex usu Galliae intellexissent communi consilio administrarent. Haec a compluribus ad Caesarem deferebantur.
 Qua re cognita Caesar, quod tantum civitati Aeduae dignitatis tribuebat, coercendum atque deterrendum quibuscumque rebus posset Dumnorigem statuebat; quod longius eius amentiam progredi videbat, prospiciendum, ne quid sibi ac rei publicae nocere posset. Itaque dies circiter XXV in eo loco commoratus, quod Corus ventus navigationem impediebat, qui magnam partem omnis temporis in his locis flare consuevit, dabat operam ut in officio Dumnorigem contineret, nihilo tamen setius omnia eius consilia cognosceret: tandem idoneam nactus tempestatem milites equitesque conscendere in naves iubet. At omnium impeditis animis Dumnorix cum equitibus Aeduorum a castris insciente Caesare domum discedere coepit. Qua re nuntiata Caesar intermissa profectione atque omnibus rebus postpositis magnam partem equitatus ad eum insequendum mittit retrahique imperat; si vim faciat neque pareat, interfici iubet, nihil hunc se absente pro sano facturum arbitratus, qui praesentis imperium neglexisset. Ille enim revocatus resistere ac se manu defendere suorumque fidem implorare coepit, saepe clamitans liberum se liberaeque esse civitatis. Illi, ut erat imperatum, circumsistunt hominem atque interficiunt: at equites Aedui ad Caesarem omnes revertuntur.
 His rebus gestis, Labieno in continente cum tribus legionibus et equitum milibus duobus relicto ut portus tueretur et rem frumentariam provideret quaeque in Gallia gererentur cognosceret consiliumque pro tempore et pro re caperet, ipse cum quinque legionibus et pari numero equitum, quem in continenti reliquerat, ad solis occasum naves solvit et leni Africo provectus media circiter nocte vento intermisso cursum non tenuit, et longius delatus aestu orta luce sub sinistra Britanniam relictam conspexit. Tum rursus aestus commutationem secutus remis contendit ut eam partem insulae caperet, qua optimum esse egressum superiore aestate cognoverat. Qua in re admodum fuit militum virtus laudanda, qui vectoriis gravibusque navigiis non intermisso remigandi labore longarum navium cursum adaequarunt. Accessum est ad Britanniam omnibus navibus meridiano fere tempore, neque in eo loco hostis est visus; sed, ut postea Caesar ex captivis cognovit, cum magnae manus eo convenissent, multitudine navium perterritae, quae cum annotinis privatisque quas sui quisque commodi fecerat amplius octingentae uno erant visae tempore, a litore discesserant ac se in superiora loca abdiderant.
 Caesar exposito exercitu et loco castris idoneo capto, ubi ex captivis cognovit quo in loco hostium copiae consedissent, cohortibus decem ad mare relictis et equitibus trecentis, qui praesidio navibus essent, de tertia vigilia ad hostes contendit, eo minus veritus navibus, quod in litore molli atque aperto deligatas ad ancoram relinquebat, et praesidio navibus Q. Atrium praefecit. Ipse noctu progressus milia passuum circiter XII hostium copias conspicatus est. Illi equitatu atque essedis ad flumen progressi ex loco superiore nostros prohibere et proelium committere coeperunt. Repulsi ab equitatu se in silvas abdiderunt, locum nacti egregie et natura et opere munitum, quem domestici belli, ut videbantur, causa iam ante praeparaverant: nam crebris arboribus succisis omnes introitus erant praeclusi. Ipsi ex silvis rari propugnabant nostrosque intra munitiones ingredi prohibebant. At milites legionis septimae, testudine facta et aggere ad munitiones adiecto, locum ceperunt eosque ex silvis expulerunt paucis vulneribus acceptis. Sed eos fugientes longius Caesar prosequi vetuit, et quod loci naturam ignorabat, et quod magna parte diei consumpta munitioni castrorum tempus relinqui volebat.
 Postridie eius diei mane tripertito milites equitesque in expeditionem misit, ut eos qui fugerant persequerentur. His aliquantum itineris progressis, cum iam extremi essent in prospectu, equites a Quinto Atrio ad Caesarem venerunt, qui nuntiarent superiore nocte maxima coorta tempestate prope omnes naves adflictas atque in litore eiectas esse, quod neque ancorae funesque subsisterent, neque nautae gubernatoresque vim tempestatis pati possent; itaque ex eo concursu navium magnum esse incommodum acceptum.
 His rebus cognitis Caesar legiones equitatumque revocari atque in itinere resistere iubet, ipse ad naves revertitur; eadem fere quae ex nuntiis litterisque cognoverat coram perspicit, sic ut amissis circiter XL navibus reliquae tamen refici posse magno negotio viderentur. Itaque ex legionibus fabros deligit et ex continenti alios arcessi iubet; Labieno scribit, ut quam plurimas posset eis legionibus, quae sunt apud eum, naves instituat. Ipse, etsi res erat multae operae ac laboris, tamen commodissimum esse statuit omnes naves subduci et cum castris una munitione coniungi. In his rebus circiter dies X consumit ne nocturnis quidem temporibus ad laborem militum intermissis. Subductis navibus castrisque egregie munitis easdem copias, quas ante, praesidio navibus reliquit: ipse eodem unde redierat proficiscitur. Eo cum venisset, maiores iam undique in eum locum copiae Britannorum convenerant summa imperi bellique administrandi communi consilio permissa Cassivellauno, cuius fines a maritimis civitatibus flumen dividit, quod appellatur Tamesis, a mari circiter milia passuum LXXX. Huic superiore tempore cum reliquis civitatibus continentia bella intercesserant; sed nostro adventu permoti Britanni hunc toti bello imperioque praefecerant.
 Britanniae pars interior ab eis incolitur quos natos in insula ipsi memoria proditum dicunt, maritima ab eis, qui praedae ac belli inferendi causa ex Belgio transierunt (qui omnes fere eis nominibus civitatum appellantur, quibus orti ex civitatibus eo pervenerunt) et bello illato ibi permanserunt atque agros colere coeperunt. Hominum est infinita multitudo creberrimaque aedificia fere Gallicis consimilia, pecorum magnus numerus. Utuntur aut aere aut nummo aureo aut taleis ferreis ad certum pondus examinatis pro nummo. Nascitur ibi plumbum album in mediterraneis regionibus, in maritimis ferrum, sed eius exigua est copia; aere utuntur importato. Materia cuiusque generis ut in Gallia est, praeter fagum atque abietem. Leporem et gallinam et anserem gustare fas non putant; haec tamen alunt animi voluptatisque causa. Loca sunt temperatiora quam in Gallia, remissioribus frigoribus.
 Insula natura triquetra, cuius unum latus est contra Galliam. Huius lateris alter angulus, qui est ad Cantium, quo fere omnes ex Gallia naves appelluntur, ad orientem solem, inferior ad meridiem spectat. Hoc pertinet circiter mila passuum quingenta. Alterum vergit ad Hispaniam atque occidentem solem; qua ex parte est Hibernia, dimidio minor, ut aestimatur, quam Britannia, sed pari spatio transmissus atque ex Gallia est in Britanniam. In hoc medio cursu est insula, quae appellatur Mona: complures praeterea minores subiectae insulae existimantur, de quibus insulis nonnulli scripserunt dies continuos triginta sub bruma esse noctem. Nos nihil de eo percontationibus reperiebamus, nisi certis ex aqua mensuris breviores esse quam in continenti noctes videbamus. Huius est longitudo lateris, ut fert illorum opinio, septingentorum milium. Tertium est contra septentriones; cui parti nulla est obiecta terra, sed eius angulus lateris maxime ad Germaniam spectat. Hoc milia passuum octingenta in longitudinem esse existimatur. Ita omnis insula est in circuitu vicies centum milium passuum.
 Ex his omnibus longe sunt humanissimi qui Cantium incolunt, quae regio est maritima omnis, neque multum a Gallica differunt consuetudine. Interiores plerique frumenta non serunt, sed lacte et carne vivunt pellibusque sunt vestiti. Omnes vero se Britanni vitro inficiunt, quod caeruleum efficit colorem, atque hoc horridiores sunt in pugna aspectu; capilloque sunt promisso atque omni parte corporis rasa praeter caput et labrum superius. Uxores habent deni duodenique inter se communes et maxime fratres cum fratribus parentesque cum liberis; sed qui sunt ex his nati, eorum habentur liberi, quo primum virgo quaeque deducta est.
 Equites hostium essedariique acriter proelio cum equitatu nostro in itinere conflixerunt, tamen ut nostri omnibus partibus superiores fuerint atque eos in silvas collesque compulerint; sed compluribus interfectis cupidius insecuti nonnullos ex suis amiserunt. At illi intermisso spatio imprudentibus nostris atque occupatis in munitione castrorum subito se ex statione pro castris collocati, acriter pugnaverunt, duabusque missis subsidio cohortibus a Caesare atque eis primis legionum duarum, cum hae perexiguo intermisso loci spatio inter se constitissent, novo genere pugnae perterritis nostris per medios audacissime perruperunt seque inde incolumes receperunt. Eo die Quintus Laberius Durus, tribunus militum, interficitur. Illi pluribus submissis cohortibus repelluntur.
 Toto hoc in genere pugnae, cum sub oculis omnium ac pro castris dimicaretur, intellectum est nostros propter gravitatem armorum, quod neque insequi cedentes possent neque ab signis discedere auderent, minus aptos esse ad huius generis hostem, equites autem magno cum periculo proelio dimicare, propterea quod illi etiam consulto plerumque cederent et, cum paulum ab legionibus nostros removissent, ex essedis desilirent et pedibus dispari proelio contenderent. Equestris autem proeli ratio et cedentibus et insequentibus par atque idem periculum inferebat. Accedebat huc ut numquam conferti sed rari magnisque intervallis proeliarentur stationesque dispositas haberent, atque alios alii deinceps exciperent, integrique et recentes defetigatis succederent.
 Postero die procul a castris hostes in collibus constiterunt rarique se ostendere et lenius quam pridie nostros equites proelio lacessere coeperunt. Sed meridie, cum Caesar pabulandi causa tres legiones atque omnem equitatum cum Gaio Trebonio legato misisset, repente ex omnibus partibus ad pabulatores advolaverunt, sic uti ab signis legionibusque non absisterent. Nostri acriter in eos impetu facto reppulerunt neque finem sequendi fecerunt, quoad subsidio confisi equites, cum post se legiones viderent, praecipites hostes egerunt magnoque eorum numero interfecto neque sui colligendi neque consistendi aut ex essedis desiliendi facultatem dederunt. Ex hac fuga protinus, quae undique convenerant, auxilia discesserunt, neque post id tempus umquam summis nobiscum copiis hostes contenderunt.
 Caesar cognito consilio eorum ad flumen Tamesim in fines Cassivellauni exercitum duxit; quod flumen uno omnino loco pedibus, atque hoc aegre, transiri potest. Eo cum venisset, animum advertit ad alteram fluminis ripam magnas esse copias hostium instructas. Ripa autem erat acutis sudibus praefixis munita, eiusdemque generis sub aqua defixae sudes flumine tegebantur. His rebus cognitis a captivis perfugisque Caesar praemisso equitatu confestim legiones subsequi iussit. Sed ea celeritate atque eo impetu milites ierunt, cum capite solo ex aqua exstarent, ut hostes impetum legionum atque equitum sustinere non possent ripasque dimitterent ac se fugae mandarent.
 Cassivellaunus, ut supra demonstravimus, omni deposita spe contentionis dimissis amplioribus copiis milibus circiter quattuor essedariorum relictis itinera nostra servabat paulumque ex via excedebat locisque impeditis ac silvestribus sese occultabat, atque eis regionibus quibus nos iter facturos cognoverat pecora atque homines ex agris in silvas compellebat et, cum equitatus noster liberius praedandi vastandique causa se in agros eiecerat, omnibus viis semitisque essedarios ex silvis emittebat et magno cum periculo nostrorum equitum cum eis confligebat atque hoc metu latius vagari prohibebat. Relinquebatur ut neque longius ab agmine legionum discedi Caesar pateretur, et tantum in agris vastandis incendiisque faciendis hostibus noceretur, quantum labore atque itinere legionarii milites efficere poterant.
 Interim Trinobantes, prope firmissima earum regionum civitas, ex qua Mandubracius adulescens Caesaris fidem secutus ad eum in continentem Galliam venerat, cuius pater in ea civitate regnum obtinuerat interfectusque erat a Cassivellauno, ipse fuga mortem vitaverat, legatos ad Caesarem mittunt pollicenturque sese ei dedituros atque imperata facturos; petunt, ut Mandubracium ab iniuria Cassivellauni defendat atque in civitatem mittat, qui praesit imperiumque obtineat. His Caesar imperat obsides quadraginta frumentumque exercitui Mandubraciumque ad eos mittit. Illi imperata celeriter fecerunt, obsides ad numerum frumentumque miserunt.
 Trinobantibus defensis atque ab omni militum inuria prohibitis Cenimagni, Segontiaci, Ancalites, Bibroci, Cassi legationibus missis sese Caesari dedunt. Ab his cognoscit non longe ex eo loco oppidum Cassivellauni abesse silvis paludibusque munitum, quo satis magnus hominum pecorisque numerus invenerit. Oppidum autem Britanni vocant, cum silvas impeditas vallo atque fossa munierunt, quo incursionis hostium vitandae causa convenire consuerunt. Eo proficiscitur cum legionibus: locum reperit egregie natura atque opere munitum; tamen hunc duabus ex partibus oppugnare contendit. Hostes paulisper morati militum nostrorum impetum non tulerunt seseque alia ex parte oppidi eiecerunt. Magnus ibi numerus pecoris repertus, multique in fuga sunt comprehensi atque interfecti.
 Dum haec in his locis geruntur, Cassivellaunus ad Cantium, quod esse ad mare supra demonstravimus, quibus regionibus quattuor reges praeerant, Cingetorix, Carvilius, Taximagulus, Segovax, nuntios mittit atque eis imperat uti coactis omnibus copiis castra navalia de improviso adoriantur atque oppugent. Ei cum ad castra venissent, nostri eruptione facta multis eorum interfectis, capto etiam nobili duce Lugotorige suos incolumes reduxerunt. Cassivellaunus hoc proelio nuntiato tot detrimentis acceptis, vastatis finibus, maxime etiam permotus defectione civitatum legatos per Atrebatem Commium de deditione ad Caesarem mittit. Caesar, cum constituisset hiemare in continenti propter repentinos Galliae motus, neque multum aestatis superesset, atque id facile extrahi posse intellegeret, obsides imperat et quid in annos singulos vectigalis populo Romano Britannia penderet constituit; interdicit atque imperat Cassivellauno, ne Mandubracio neu Trinobantibus noceat.
 Obsidibus acceptis exercitum reducit ad mare, naves invenit refectas. His deductis, quod et captivorum magnum numerum habebat, et nonnullae tempestate deperierant naves, duobus commeatibus exercitum reportare instituit. Ac sic accidit, uti ex tanto navium numero tot navigationibus neque hoc neque superiore anno ulla omnino navis, quae milites portaret, desideraretur; at ex eis, quae inanes ex continenti ad eum remitterentur et prioris commeatus expositis militibus et quas postea Labienus faciendas curaverat numero LX, perpaucae locum caperent, reliquae fere omnes reicerentur. Quas cum aliquamdiu Caesar frustra exspectasset, ne anni tempore a navigatione excluderetur, quod aequinoctium suberat, necessario angustius milites collocavit ac summa tranquillitate consecuta, secunda inita cum solvisset vigilia, prima luce terram attigit omnesque incolumes naves perduxit.
 Subductis navibus concilioque Gallorum Samarobrivae peracto, quod eo anno frumentum in Gallia propter siccitates angustius provenerat, coactus est aliter ac superioribus annis exercitum in hibernis collocare legionesque in plures civitates distribuere. Ex quibus unam in Morinos ducendam Gaio Fabio legato dedit, alteram in Nervios Quinto Ciceroni, tertiam in Esubios Lucio Roscio; quartam in Remis cum Tito Labieno in confinio Treverorum hiemare iussit. Tres in Belgis collocavit: eis Marcum Crassum quaestorem et Lucium Munatium Plancum et Gaium Trebonium legatos praefecit. Unam legionem, quam proxime trans Padum conscripserat, et cohortes V in Eburones, quorum pars maxima est inter Mosam ac Rhenum, qui sub imperio Ambiorigis et Catuvolci erant, misit. Eis militibus Quintum Titurium Sabinum et Lucium Aurunculeium Cottam legatos praeesse iussit. Ad hunc modum distributis legionibus facillime inopiae frumentariae sese mederi posse existimavit. Atque harum tamen omnium legionum hiberna praeter eam, quam Lucio Roscio in pacatissimam et quietissimam partem ducendam dederat, milibus passuum centum continebantur. Ipse interea, quoad legiones collocatas munitaque hiberna cognovisset, in Gallia morari constituit.
 Erat in Carnutibus summo loco natus Tasgetius, cuius maiores in sua civitate regnum obtinuerant. Huic Caesar pro eius virtute atque in se benevolentia, quod in omnibus bellis singulari eius opera fuerat usus, maiorum locum restituerat. Tertium iam hunc annum regnantem inimici, multis palam ex civitate eius auctoribus, eum interfecerunt. Defertur ea res ad Caesarem. Ille veritus, quod ad plures pertinebat, ne civitas eorum impulsu deficeret, Lucium Plancum cum legione ex Belgio celeriter in Carnutes proficisci iubet ibique hiemare quorumque opera cognoverat Tasgetium interfectum, hos comprehensos ad se mittere. Interim ab omnibus legatis quaestoreque, quibus legiones tradiderat, certior factus est in hiberna perventum locumque hibernis esse munitum.
 Diebus circiter XV, quibus in hiberna ventum est, initium repentini tumultus ac defectionis ortum est ab Ambiorige et Catuvolco; qui, cum ad fines regni sui Sabino Cottaeque praesto fuissent frumentumque in hiberna comportavissent, Indutiomari Treveri nuntiis impulsi suos concitaverunt subitoque oppressis lignatoribus magna manu ad castra oppugnatum venerunt. Cum celeriter nostri arma cepissent vallumque adscendissent atque una ex parte Hispanis equitibus emissis equestri proelio superiores fuissent, desperata re hostes suos ab oppugnatione reduxerunt. Tum suo more conclamaverunt, uti aliqui ex nostris ad colloquium prodiret: habere sese, quae de re communi dicere vellent, quibus rebus controversias minui posse sperarent.
 Mittitur ad eos colloquendi causa Gaius Arpineius, eques Romanus, familiaris Quinti Tituri, et Quintus Iunius ex Hispania quidam, qui iam ante missu Caesaris ad Ambiorigem ventitare consuerat; apud quos Ambiorix ad hunc modum locutus est: Sese pro Caesaris in se beneficiis plurimum ei confiteri debere, quod eius opera stipendio liberatus esset, quod Aduatucis, finitimis suis, pendere consuesset, quodque ei et filius et fratris filius ab Caesare remissi essent, quos Aduatuci obsidum numero missos apud in servitute et catenis tenuissent; neque id, quod fecerit de oppugnatione castrorum, aut iudicio aut voluntate sua fecisse, sed coactu civitatis, suaque esse eiusmodi imperia, ut non minus haberet iuris in se multitudo quam ipse in multitudinem. Civitati porro hanc fuisse belli causam, quod repentinae Gallorum coniurationi resistere non potuerit. Id se facile ex humilitate sua probare posse, quod non adeo sit imperitus rerum ut suis copiis populum Romanum superari posse confidat. Sed esse Galliae commune consilium: omnibus hibernis Caesaris oppugnandis hunc esse dictum diem, ne qua legio alterae legioni subsidio venire posset. Non facile Gallos Gallis negare potuisse, praesertim cum de recuperanda communi libertate consilium initum videretur. Quibus quoniam pro pietate satisfecerit, habere nunc se rationem offici pro beneficiis Caesaris: monere, orare Titurium pro hospitio, ut suae ac militum saluti consulat. Magnam manum Germanorum conductam Rhenum transisse; hanc adfore biduo. Ipsorum esse consilium, velintne priusquam finitimi sentiant eductos ex hibernis milites aut ad Ciceronem aut ad Labienum deducere, quorum alter milia passuum circiter quinquaginta, alter paulo amplius ab eis absit. Illud se polliceri et iureiurando confirmare tutum iter per fines daturum. Quod cum faciat, et civitati sese consulere, quod hibernis levetur, et Caesari pro eius meritis gratiam referre. Hac oratione habita discedit Ambiorix.
 Arpineius et Iunius, quae audierunt, ad legatos deferunt. Illi repentina re perturbati, etsi ab hoste ea dicebantur, tamen non neglegenda existimabant maximeque hac re permovebantur, quod civitatem ignobilem atque humilem Eburonum sua sponte populo Romano bellum facere ausam vix erat credendum. Itaque ad consilium rem deferunt magnaque inter eos exsistit controversia. Lucius Aurunculeius compluresque tribuni militum et primorum ordinum centuriones nihil temere agendum neque ex hibernis iniussu Caesaris discedendum existimabant: quantasvis  copias etiam Germanorum sustineri posse munitis hibernis docebant: rem esse testimonio, quod primum hostium impetum multis ultro vulneribus illatis fortissime sustinuerint: re frumentaria non premi; interea et ex proximis hibernis et a Caesare conventura subsidia: postremo quid esse levius aut turpius, quam auctore hoste de summis rebus capere consilium?
 Contra ea Titurius sero facturos clamitabat, cum maiores manus hostium adiunctis Germanis convenissent aut cum aliquid calamitatis in proximis hibernis esset acceptum. Brevem consulendi esse occasionem. Caesarem arbitrari profectum in Italiam; neque aliter Carnutes interficiendi Tasgeti consilium fuisse capturos, neque Eburones, si ille adesset, tanta contemptione nostri ad castra venturos esse. Non hostem auctorem, sed rem spectare: subesse Rhenum; magno esse Germanis dolori Ariovisti mortem et superiores nostras victorias; ardere Galliam tot contumeliis acceptis sub populi Romani imperium redactam superiore gloria rei militaris exstincta. Postremo quis hoc sibi persuaderet, sine certa re Ambiorigem ad eiusmodi consilium descendisse? Suam sententiam in utramque partem esse tutam: si nihil esset durius, nullo cum periculo ad proximam legionem perventuros; si Gallia omnis cum Germanis consentiret, unam esse in celeritate positam salutem. Cottae quidem atque eorum, qui dissentirent, consilium quem habere exitum? In quo si non praesens periculum, at certe longinqua obsidione fames esset timenda.
 Hac in utramque partem disputatione habita, cum a Cotta primisque ordinibus acriter resisteretur, ""Vincite,"" inquit, ""si ita vultis,"" Sabinus, et id clariore voce, ut magna pars militum exaudiret; ""neque is sum,"" inquit, ""qui gravissime ex vobis mortis periculo terrear: hi sapient; si gravius quid acciderit, abs te rationem reposcent, qui, si per te liceat, perendino die cum proximis hibernis coniuncti communem cum reliquis belli casum sustineant, non reiecti et relegati longe ab ceteris aut ferro aut fame intereant.""
 Consurgitur ex consilio; comprehendunt utrumque et orant, ne sua dissensione et pertinacia rem in summum periculum deducat: facilem esse rem, seu maneant, seu proficiscantur, si modo unum omnes sentiant ac probent; contra in dissensione nullam se salutem perspicere. Res disputatione ad mediam noctem perducitur. Tandem dat Cotta permotus manus: superat sententia Sabini. Pronuntiatur prima luce ituros. Consumitur vigiliis reliqua pars noctis, cum sua quisque miles circumspiceret, quid secum portare posset, quid ex instrumento hibernorum relinquere cogeretur. Omnia excogitantur, quare nec sine periculo maneatur, et languore militum et vigiliis periculum augeatur. Prima luce sic ex castris proficiscuntur, ut quibus esset persuasum non ab hoste, sed ab homine amicissimo Ambiorige consilium datum, longissimo agmine maximisque impedimentis.
 At hostes, posteaquam ex nocturno fremitu vigiliisque de profectione eorum senserunt, collocatis insidiis bipertito in silvis opportuno atque occulto loco a milibus passuum circiter duobus Romanorum adventum exspectabant, et cum se maior pars agminis in magnam convallem demisisset, ex utraque parte eius vallis subito se ostenderunt novissimosque premere et primos prohibere ascensu atque iniquissimo nostris loco proelium committere coeperunt.
 Tum demum Titurius, qui nihil ante providisset, trepidare et concursare cohortesque disponere, haec tamen ipsa timide atque ut eum omnia deficere viderentur; quod plerumque eis accidere consuevit, qui in ipso negotio consilium capere coguntur. At Cotta, qui cogitasset haec posse in itinere accidere atque ob eam causam profectionis auctor non fuisset, nulla in re communi saluti deerat et in appellandis cohortandisque militibus imperatoris et in pugna militis officia praestabat. Cum propter longitudinem agminis minus facile omnia per se obire et, quid quoque loco faciendum esset, providere possent, iusserunt pronuntiare, ut impedimenta relinquerent atque in orbem consisterent. Quod consilium etsi in eiusmodi casu reprehendendum non est, tamen incommode accidit: nam et nostris militibus spem minuit et hostes ad pugnam alacriores effecit, quod non sine summo timore et desperatione id factum videbatur. Praeterea accidit, quod fieri necesse erat, ut vulgo milites ab signis discederent, quae quisque eorum carissima haberet, ab impedimentis petere atque arripere properaret, clamore et fletu omnia complerentur.
 At barbaris consilium non defuit. Nam duces eorum tota acie pronuntiare iusserunt, ne quis ab loco discederet: illorum esse praedam atque illis reservari quaecumque Romani reliquissent: proinde omnia in victoria posita existimarent. Erant et virtute et studio pugnandi pares; nostri, tametsi ab duce et a fortuna deserebantur, tamen omnem spem salutis in virtute ponebant, et quotiens quaeque cohors procurrerat, ab ea parte magnus numerus hostium cadebat. Qua re animadversa Ambiorix pronuntiari iubet, ut procul tela coniciant neu propius accedant et, quam in partem Romani impetum fecerint, cedant (levitate armorum et cotidiana exercitatione nihil eis noceri posse), rursus se ad signa recipientes insequantur.
 Quo praecepto ab eis diligentissime observato, cum quaepiam cohors ex orbe excesserat atque impetum fecerat, hostes velocissime refugiebant. Interim eam partem nudari necesse erat et ab latere aperto tela recipi. Rursus cum in eum locum unde erant egressi reverti coeperant, et ab eis qui cesserant et ab eis qui proximi steterant circumveniebantur; sin autem locum tenere vellent, nec virtuti locus relinquebatur, neque ab tanta multitudine coniecta tela conferti vitare poterant. Tamen tot incommodis conflictati, multis vulneribus acceptis resistebant et magna parte diei consumpta, cum a prima luce ad horam octavam pugnaretur, nihil quod ipsis esset indignum committebant. Tum Tito Balventio, qui superiore anno primum pilum duxerat, viro forti et magnae auctoritatis, utrumque femur tragula traicitur; Quintus Lucanius, eiusdem ordinis, fortissime pugnans, dum circumvento filio subvenit, interficitur; Lucius Cotta legatus omnes cohortes ordinesque adhortans in adversum os funda vulneratur.
 His rebus permotus Quintus Titurius, cum procul Ambiorigem suos cohortantem conspexisset, interpretem suum Gnaeum Pompeium ad eum mittit rogatum ut sibi militibusque parcat. Ille appellatus respondit: si velit secum colloqui, licere; sperare a multitudine impetrari posse, quod ad militum salutem pertineat; ipsi vero nihil nocitum iri, inque eam rem se suam fidem interponere. Ille cum Cotta saucio communicat, si videatur, pugna ut excedant et cum Ambiorige una colloquantur: sperare ab eo de sua ac militum salute impetrari posse. Cotta se ad armatum hostem iturum negat atque in eo perseverat.
 Sabinus quos in praesentia tribunos militum circum se habebat et primorum ordinum centuriones se sequi iubet et, cum propius Ambiorigem accessisset, iussus arma abicere imperatum facit suisque ut idem faciant imperat. Interim, dum de condicionibus inter se agunt longiorque consulto ab Ambiorige instituitur sermo, paulatim circumventus interficitur. Tum vero suo more victoriam conclamant atque ululatum tollunt impetuque in nostros facto ordines perturbant. Ibi Lucius Cotta pugnans interficitur cum maxima parte militum. Reliqui se in castra recipiunt unde erant egressi. Ex quibus Lucius Petrosidius aquilifer, cum magna multitudine hostium premeretur, aquilam intra vallum proiecit; ipse pro castris fortissime pugnans occiditur. Illi aegre ad noctem oppugnationem sustinent; noctu ad unum omnes desperata salute se ipsi interficiunt. Pauci ex proelio lapsi incertis itineribus per silvas ad Titum Labienum legatum in hiberna perveniunt atque eum de rebus gestis certiorem faciunt.
 Hac victoria sublatus Ambiorix statim cum equitatu in Aduatucos, qui erant eius regno finitimi, proficiscitur; neque noctem neque diem intermittit peditatumque subsequi iubet. Re demonstrata Aduatucisque concitatis postero die in Nervios pervenit hortaturque, ne sui in perpetuum liberandi atque ulciscendi Romanos pro eis quas acceperint iniuriis occasionem dimittant: interfectos esse legatos duos magnamque partem exercitus interisse demonstrat; nihil esse negoti subito oppressam legionem quae cum Cicerone hiemet interfici; se ad eam rem profitetur adiutorem. Facile hac oratione Nerviis persuadet.
 Itaque confestim dimissis nuntiis ad Ceutrones, Grudios, Levacos, Pleumoxios, Geidumnos, qui omnes sub eorum imperio sunt, quam maximas manus possunt cogunt et de improviso ad Ciceronis hiberna advolant nondum ad eum fama de Tituri morte perlata. Huic quoque accidit, quod fuit necesse, ut nonnulli milites, qui lignationis munitionisque causa in silvas discessissent, repentino equitum adventu interciperentur. His circumventis magna manu Eburones, Nervii, Aduatuci atque horum omnium socii et clientes legionem oppugnare incipiunt. Nostri celeriter ad arma concurrunt, vallum conscendunt. Aegre is dies sustentatur, quod omnem spem hostes in celeritate ponebant atque hanc adepti victoriam in perpetuum se fore victores confidebant.
 Mittuntur ad Caesarem confestim ab Cicerone litterae magnis propositis praemiis, si pertulissent: obsessis omnibus viis missi intercipiuntur. Noctu ex materia, quam munitionis causa comportaverant, turres admodum CXX excitantur incredibili celeritate; quae deesse operi videbantur, perficiuntur. Hostes postero die multo maioribus coactis copiis castra oppugnant, fossam complent. Eadem ratione, qua pridie, ab nostris resistitur. Hoc idem reliquis deinceps fit diebus. Nulla pars nocturni temporis ad laborem intermittitur; non aegris, non vulneratis facultas quietis datur. Quaecumque ad proximi diei oppugnationem opus sunt noctu comparantur; multae praeustae sudes, magnus muralium pilorum numerus instituitur; turres contabulantur, pinnae loricaeque ex cratibus attexuntur. Ipse Cicero, cum tenuissima valetudine esset, ne nocturnum quidem sibi tempus ad quietem relinquebat, ut ultro militum concursu ac vocibus sibi parcere cogeretur.
 Tunc duces principesque Nerviorum qui aliquem sermonis aditum causamque amicitiae cum Cicerone habebant colloqui sese velle dicunt. Facta potestate eadem quae Ambiorix cum Titurio egerat commemorant: omnem esse in armis Galliam; Germanos Rhenum transisse; Caesaris reliquorumque hiberna oppugnari. Addunt etiam de Sabini morte: Ambiorigem ostentant fidei faciendae causa. Errare eos dicunt, si quidquam ab his praesidi sperent, qui suis rebus diffidant; sese tamen hoc esse in Ciceronem populumque Romanum animo, ut nihil nisi hiberna recusent atque hanc inveterascere consuetudinem nolint: licere illis incolumibus per se ex hibernis discedere et quascumque in partes velint sine metu proficisci. Cicero ad haec unum modo respondit: non esse consuetudinem populi Romani accipere ab hoste armato condicionem: si ab armis discedere velint, se adiutore utantur legatosque ad Caesarem mittant; sperare pro eius iustitia, quae petierint, impetraturos.
 Ab hac spe repulsi Nervii vallo pedum IX et fossa pedum XV hiberna cingunt. Haec et superiorum annorum consuetudine ab nobis cognoverant et, quos clam de exercitu habebant captivos, ab eis docebantur; sed nulla ferramentorum copia quae esset ad hunc usum idonea, gladiis caespites circumcidere, manibus sagulisque terram exhaurire nitebantur. Qua quidem ex re hominum multitudo cognosci potuit: nam minus horis tribus milium pedum XV in circuitu munitionem perfecerunt reliquisque diebus turres ad altitudinem valli, falces testudinesque, quas idem captivi docuerant, parare ac facere coeperunt.
 Septimo oppugnationis die maximo coorto vento ferventes fusili ex argilla glandes fundis et fervefacta iacula in casas, quae more Gallico stramentis erant tectae, iacere coeperunt. Hae celeriter ignem comprehenderunt et venti magnitudine in omnem locum castrorum distulerunt. Hostes maximo clamore sicuti parta iam atque explorata victoria turres testudinesque agere et scalis vallum ascendere coeperunt. At tanta militum virtus atque ea praesentia animi fuit, ut, cum undique flamma torrerentur maximaque telorum multitudine premerentur suaque omnia impedimenta atque omnes fortunas conflagrare intellegerent, non modo demigrandi causa de vallo decederet nemo, sed paene ne respiceret quidem quisquam, ac tum omnes acerrime fortissimeque pugnarent. Hic dies nostris longe gravissimus fuit; sed tamen hunc habuit eventum, ut eo die maximus numerus hostium vulneraretur atque interficeretur, ut se sub ipso vallo constipaverant recessumque primis ultimi non dabant. Paulum quidem intermissa flamma et quodam loco turri adacta et contingente vallum tertiae cohortis centuriones ex eo, quo stabant, loco recesserunt suosque omnes removerunt, nutu vocibusque hostes, si introire vellent, vocare coeperunt; quorum progredi ausus est nemo. Tum ex omni parte lapidibus coniectis deturbati, turrisque succensa est.
 Erant in ea legione fortissimi viri, centuriones, qui primis ordinibus appropinquarent, Titus Pullo et Lucius Vorenus. Hi perpetuas inter se controversias habebant, quinam anteferretur, omnibusque annis de locis summis simultatibus contendebant. Ex his Pullo, cum acerrime ad munitiones pugnaretur, ""Quid dubitas,"" inquit, "" Vorene? aut quem locum tuae probandae virtutis exspectas ? hic dies de nostris controversiis iudicabit."" Haec cum dixisset, procedit extra munitiones quaque pars hostium confertissima est visa irrumpit. Ne Vorenus quidem tum sese vallo continet, sed omnium veritus existimationem subsequitur. Mediocri spatio relicto Pullo pilum in hostes immittit atque unum ex multitudine procurrentem traicit; quo percusso et exanimato hunc scutis protegunt, in hostem tela universi coniciunt neque dant regrediendi facultatem. Transfigitur scutum Pulloni et verutum in balteo defigitur. Avertit hic casus vaginam et gladium educere conanti dextram moratur manum, impeditumque hostes circumsistunt. Succurrit inimicus illi Vorenus et laboranti subvenit. Ad hunc se confestim a Pullone omnis multitudo convertit: illum veruto arbitrantur occisum. Gladio comminus rem gerit Vorenus atque uno interfecto reliquos paulum propellit; dum cupidius instat, in locum deiectus inferiorem concidit. Huic rursus circumvento fert subsidium Pullo, atque ambo incolumes compluribus interfectis summa cum laude sese intra munitiones recipiunt. Sic fortuna in contentione et certamine utrumque versavit, ut alter alteri inimicus auxilio salutique esset, neque diiudicari posset, uter utri virtute anteferendus videretur.
 Quanto erat in dies gravior atque asperior oppugnatio, et maxime quod magna parte militum confecta vulneribus res ad paucitatem defensorum pervenerat, tanto crebriores litterae nuntiique ad Caesarem mittebantur; quorum pars deprehensa in conspectu nostrorum militum cum cruciatu necabatur. Erat unus intus Nervius nomine Vertico, loco natus honesto, qui a prima obsidione ad Ciceronem perfugerat suamque ei fidem praestiterat. Hic servo spe libertatis magnisque persuadet praemiis, ut litteras ad Caesarem deferat. Has ille in iaculo illigatas effert et Gallus inter Gallos sine ulla suspicione versatus ad Caesarem pervenit. Ab eo de periculis Ciceronis legionisque cognoscitur.
 Caesar acceptis litteris hora circiter XI diei statim nuntium in Bellovacos ad M. Crassum quaestorem mittit, cuius hiberna aberant ab eo milia passuum XXV; iubet media nocte legionem proficisci celeriterque ad se venire. Exit cum nuntio Crassus. Alterum ad Gaium Fabium legatum mittit, ut in Atrebatium fines legionem adducat, qua sibi iter faciendum sciebat. Scribit Labieno, si rei publicae commodo facere posset, cum legione ad fines Nerviorum veniat. Reliquam partem exercitus, quod paulo aberat longius, non putat exspectandam; equites circiter quadringentos ex proximis hibernis colligit.
 Hora circiter tertia ab antecursoribus de Crassi adventu certior factus eo die milia passuum XX procedit. Crassum Samarobrivae praeficit legionemque attribuit, quod ibi impedimenta exercitus, obsides civitatum, litteras publicas frumentumque omne quod eo tolerandae hiemis causa devexerat relinquebat. Fabius, ut imperatum erat, non ita multum moratus in itinere cum legione occurrit. Labienus interitu Sabini et caede cohortium cognita, cum omnes ad eum Treverorum copiae venissent, veritus, si ex hibernis fugae similem profectionem fecisset, ut hostium impetum sustinere posset, praesertim quos recenti victoria efferri sciret, litteras Caesari remittit, quanto cum periculo legionem ex hibernis educturus esset; rem gestam in Eburonibus perscribit; docet omnes equitatus peditatusque copias Treverorum tria milia passuum longe ab suis castris consedisse.
 Caesar consilio eius probato, etsi opinione trium legionum deiectus ad duas redierat, tamen unum communis salutis auxilium in celeritate ponebat. Venit magnis itineribus in Nerviorum fines. Ibi ex captivis cognoscit, quae apud Ciceronem gerantur, quantoque in periculo res sit. Tum cuidam ex equitibus Gallis magnis praemiis persuadet uti ad Ciceronem epistolam deferat. Hanc Graecis conscriptam litteris mittit, ne intercepta epistola nostra ab hostibus consilia cognoscantur. Si adire non possit, monet ut tragulam cum epistola ad amentum deligata intra munitionem castrorum abiciat. In litteris scribit se cum legionibus profectum celeriter adfore; hortatur ut pristinam virtutem retineat. Gallus periculum veritus, ut erat praeceptum, tragulam mittit. Haec casu ad turrim adhaesit neque ab nostris biduo animadversa tertio die a quodam milite conspicitur, dempta ad Ciceronem defertur. Ille perlectam in conventu militum recitat maximaque omnes laetitia adficit. Tum fumi incendiorum procul videbantur; quae res omnem dubitationem adventus legionum expulit.
 Galli re cognita per exploratores obsidionem relinquunt, ad Caesarem omnibus copiis contendunt. Hae erant armata circiter milia LX. Cicero data facultate Gallum ab eodem Verticone, quem supra demonstravimus, repetit, qui litteras ad Caesarem deferat; hunc admonet, iter caute diligenterque faciat: perscribit in litteris hostes ab se discessisse omnemque ad eum multitudinem convertisse. Quibus litteris circiter media nocte Caesar adlatis suos facit certiores eosque ad dimicandum animo confirmat. Postero die luce prima movet castra et circiter milia passuum quattuor progressus trans vallem et rivum multitudinem hostium conspicatur. Erat magni periculi res tantulis copiis iniquo loco dimicare; tum, quoniam obsidione liberatum Ciceronem sciebat, aequo animo remittendum de celeritate existimabat: consedit et quam aequissimo loco potest castra communit atque haec, etsi erant exigua per se vix hominum milium septem praesertim nullis cum impedimentis, tamen angustiis viarum quam maxime potest contrahit, eo consilio, ut in summam contemptionem hostibus veniat. Interim speculatoribus in omnes partes dimissis explorat quo commodissime itinere vallem transire possit.
 Eo die parvulis equestribus proeliis ad aquam factis utrique sese suo loco continent: Galli, quod ampliores copias, quae nondum convenerant, exspectabant; Caesar, si forte timoris simulatione hostes in suum locum elicere posset, ut citra vallem pro castris proelio contenderet, si id efficere non posset, ut exploratis itineribus minore cum periculo vallem rivumque transiret. Prima luce hostium equitatus ad castra accedit proeliumque cum nostris equitibus committit. Caesar consulto equites cedere seque in castra recipere iubet, simul ex omnibus partibus castra altiore vallo muniri portasque obstrui atque in his administrandis rebus quam maxime concursari et cum simulatione agi timoris iubet.
 Quibus omnibus rebus hostes invitati copias traducunt aciemque iniquo loco constituunt, nostris vero etiam de vallo deductis propius accedunt et tela intra munitionem ex omnibus partibus coniciunt praeconibusque circummissis pronuntiari iubent, seu quis Gallus seu Romanus velit ante horam tertiam ad se transire, sine periculo licere; post id tempus non fore potestatem: ac sic nostros contempserunt, ut obstructis in speciem portis singulis ordinibus caespitum, quod ea non posse introrumpere videbantur, alii vallum manu scindere, alii fossas complere inciperent. Tum Caesar omnibus portis eruptione facta equitatuque emisso celeriter hostes in fugam dat, sic uti omnino pugnandi causa resisteret nemo, magnumque ex eis numerum occidit atque omnes armis exuit.
 Longius prosequi veritus, quod silvae paludesque intercedebant neque etiam parvulo detrimento illorum locum relinqui videbat, omnibus suis incolumibus copiis eodem die ad Ciceronem pervenit. Institutas turres, testudines munitionesque hostium admiratur; legione producta cognoscit non decimum quemque esse reliquum militem sine vulnere: ex his omnibus iudicat rebus, quanto cum periculo et quanta cum virtute res sint administratae. Ciceronem pro eius merito legionemque collaudat; centuriones singillatim tribunosque militum appellat, quorum egregiam fuisse virtutem testimonio Ciceronis cognoverat. De casu Sabini et Cottae certius ex captivis cognoscit. Postero die contione habita rem gestam proponit, milites consolatur et confirmat: quod detrimentum culpa et temeritate legati sit acceptum, hoc aequiore animo ferendum docet, quod beneficio deorum immortalium et virtute eorum expiato incommodo neque hostibus diutina laetatio neque ipsis longior dolor relinquatur.
 Interim ad Labienum per Remos incredibili celeritate de victoria Caesaris fama perfertur, ut, cum ab hibernis Ciceronis milia passuum abesset circiter LX, eoque post horam nonam diei Caesar pervenisset, ante mediam noctem ad portas castrorum clamor oreretur, quo clamore significatio victoriae gratulatioque ab Remis Labieno fieret. Hac fama ad Treveros perlata Indutiomarus, qui postero die castra Labieni oppugnare decreverat, noctu profugit copiasque omnes in Treveros reducit. Caesar Fabium cum sua legione remittit in hiberna, ipse cum tribus legionibus circum Samarobrivam trinis hibernis hiemare constituit et, quod tanti motus Galliae exstiterant, totam hiemem ipse ad exercitum manere decrevit. Nam illo incommodo de Sabini morte perlato omnes fere Galliae civitates de bello consultabant, nuntios legationesque in omnes partes dimittebant et quid reliqui consili caperent atque unde initium belli fieret explorabant nocturnaque in locis desertis concilia habebant. Neque ullum fere totius hiemis tempus sine sollicitudine Caesaris intercessit, quin aliquem de consiliis ac motu Gallorum nuntium acciperet. In his ab Lucio Roscio, quem legioni tertiae decimae praefecerat, certior factus est magnas Gallorum copias earum civitatum, quae Armoricae appellantur, oppugnandi sui causa convenisse neque longius milia passuum octo ab hibernis suis afuisse, sed nuntio allato de victoria Caesaris discessisse, adeo ut fugae similis discessus videretur.
 At Caesar principibus cuiusque civitatis ad se evocatis alias territando, cum se scire quae fierent denuntiaret, alias cohortando magnam partem Galliae in officio tenuit. Tamen Senones, quae est civitas in primis firma et magnae inter Gallos auctoritatis, Cavarinum, quem Caesar apud eos regem constituerat, cuius frater Moritasgus adventu in Galliam Caesaris cuiusque maiores regnum obtinuerant, interficere publico consilio conati, cum ille praesensisset ac profugisset, usque ad fines insecuti regno domoque expulerunt et, missis ad Caesarem satisfaciendi causa legatis, cum is omnem ad se senatum venire iussisset, dicto audientes non fuerunt. Tantum apud homines barbaros valuit esse aliquos repertos principes inferendi belli tantamque omnibus voluntatum commutationem attulit, ut praeter Aeduos et Remos, quos praecipuo semper honore Caesar habuit, alteros pro vetere ac perpetua erga populum Romanum fide, alteros pro recentibus Gallici belli officiis, nulla fere civitas fuerit non suspecta nobis. Idque adeo haud scio mirandumne sit, cum compluribus aliis de causis, tum maxime quod ei, qui virtute belli omnibus gentibus praeferebantur, tantum se eius opinionis deperdidisse ut a populo Romano imperia perferrent gravissime dolebant.
 Treveri vero atque Indutiomarus totius hiemis nullum tempus intermiserunt, quin trans Rhenum legatos mitterent, civitates sollicitarent, pecunias pollicerentur, magna parte exercitus nostri interfecta multo minorem superesse dicerent partem. Neque tamen ulli civitati Germanorum persuaderi potuit, ut Rhenum transiret, cum se bis expertos dicerent, Ariovisti bello et Tencterorum transitu: non esse amplius fortunam temptaturos. Hac spe lapsus Indutiomarus nihilo minus copias cogere, exercere, a finitimis equos parare, exules damnatosque tota Gallia magnis praemiis ad se allicere coepit. Ac tantam sibi iam his rebus in Gallia auctoritatem comparaverat ut undique ad eum legationes concurrerent, gratiam atque amicitiam publice privatimque peterent.
 Ubi intellexit ultro ad se veniri, altera ex parte Senones Carnutesque conscientia facinoris instigari, altera Nervios Aduatucosque bellum Romanis parare, neque sibi voluntariorum copias defore, si ex finibus suis progredi coepisset, armatum concilium indicit. Hoc more Gallorum est initium belli, quo lege communi omnes puberes armati convenire consuerunt; qui ex eis novissimus convenit, in conspectu multitudinis omnibus cruciatibus affectus necatur. In eo concilio Cingetorigem, alterius principem factionis, generum suum, quem supra demonstravimus Caesaris secutum fidem ab eo non discessisse, hostem iudicat bonaque eius publicat. His rebus confectis, in concilio pronuntiat arcessitum se a Senonibus et Carnutibus aliisque compluribus Galliae civitatibus; huc iturum per fines Remorum eorumque agros populaturum ac, priusquam id faciat, castra Labieni oppugnaturum. Quae fieri velit praecipit.
 Labienus, cum et loci natura et manu munitissumis castris sese teneret, de suo ac legionis periculo nihil timebat; ne quam occasionem rei bene gerendae dimitteret, cogitabat. Itaque a Cingetorige atque eius propinquis oratione Indutiomari cognita, quam in concilio habuerat, nuntios mittit ad finitimas civitates equitesque undique evocat: his certum diem conveniendi dicit. Interim prope cotidie cum omni equitatu Indutiomarus sub castris eius vagabatur, alias ut situm castrorum cognosceret, alias colloquendi aut territandi causa: equites plerumque omnes tela intra vallum coniciebant. Labienus suos intra munitionem continebat timorisque opinionem, quibuscumque poterat rebus, augebat.
 Cum maiore in dies contemptione Indutiomarus ad castra accederet, nocte una intromissis equitibus omnium finitimarum civitatum quos arcessendos curaverat, tanta diligentia omnes suos custodiis intra castra continuit, ut nulla ratione ea res enuntiari aut ad Treveros perferri posset. Interim ex consuetudine cotidiana Indutiomarus ad castra accedit atque ibi magnam partem diei consumit; equites tela coniciunt et magna cum contumelia verborum nostros ad pugnam evocant. Nullo ab nostris dato responso, ubi visum est, sub vesperum dispersi ac dissipati discedunt. Subito Labienus duabus portis omnem equitatum emittit; praecipit atque interdicit, proterritis hostibus atque in fugam coniectis (quod fore, sicut accidit, videbat) unum omnes peterent Indutiomarum, neu quis quem prius vulneret, quam illum interfectum viderit, quod mora reliquorum spatium nactum illum effugere nolebat; magna proponit eis qui occiderint praemia; summittit cohortes equitibus subsidio. Comprobat hominis consilium fortuna, et cum unum omnes peterent, in ipso fluminis vado deprehensus Indutiomarus interficitur, caputque eius refertur in castra: redeuntes equites quos possunt consectantur atque occidunt. Hac re cognita omnes Eburonum et Nerviorum quae convenerant copiae discedunt, pauloque habuit post id factum Caesar quietiorem Galliam."
181,128492947,Ala Una!,Apekz,[18],['Hip Hop/Rap'],"I. IN the course of his sixteenth year  he lost his father. In the next consulate, having previously been nominated priest of Jupiter , he broke his engagement with Cossutia, a lady of only equestrian rank, but very wealthy, who had been betrothed to him before he assumed the gown of manhood, and married Cornelia, daughter of that Cinna who was four times consul, by whom he afterwards had a daughter Julia; and the dictator Sulla could by no means force him to put away his wife. Therefore besides being punished by the loss of his priesthood, his wife's dowry, and his family inheritances, Caesar was held to be one of the opposite party. He was accordingly forced to go into hiding, and though suffering from a severe attack of quartan ague, to change from one covert to another almost every night, and save himself from Sulla's detectives by bribes. But at last, through the good offices of the Vestal virgins and of his near kinsmen, Mamercus Aemilius and Aurelius Cotta, he obtained forgiveness. Everyone knows that when Sulla had long held out against the most devoted and eminent men of his party who interceded for Caesar, and they obstinately persisted, he at last gave way and cried, either by divine inspiration or a shrewd forecast: 'Have your way and take him; only bear in mind that the man you are so eager to save will one day deal the death blow to the cause of the aristocracy, which you have joined with me in upholding; for in this Caesar there is more than one Marius.'
II. He served his first campaign in Asia on the personal staff of Marcus Thermus, governor of the province . Being sent by Thermus to Bithynia, to fetch a fleet, he dawdled so long at the court of Nicomedes that he was suspected of improper relations with the king; and he lent color to this scandal by going back to Bithynia a few days after his return, with the alleged purpose of collecting a debt for a freedman, one of his dependents. During the rest of the campaign he enjoyed a better reputation, and at the storming of Mytilene  Thermus awarded him the civic crown .
III. He served too under Servilius Isauricus in Cilicia, but only for a short time; for learning of the death of Sulla, and at the same time hoping to profit by a counter-revolution which Marcus Lepidus was setting on foot, he hurriedly returned to Rome . But he did not make common cause with Lepidus, although he was offered highly favorable terms, through lack of confidence both in that leader's capacity and in the outlook, which he found less promising than he had expected.
IV. Then, after the civil disturbance had been quieted, he brought a charge of extortion against Cornelius Dolabella, an ex-consul who had been honored with a triumph . On the acquittal of Dolabella, Caesar determined to withdraw to Rhodes, to escape from the ill-will which he had incurred, and at the same time to rest and have leisure to study under Apollonius Molo, the most eminent teacher of oratory of that time. While crossing to Rhodes , after the winter season had already begun, he was taken by pirates near the island of Pharmacussa and remained in their custody for nearly forty days in a state of intense vexation, attended only by a single physician and two body-servants; for he had sent off his travelling companions and the rest of his attendants at the outset, to raise money for his ransom. Once he was set on shore on payment of fifty talents, he did not delay then and there to launch a fleet and pursue the departing pirates, and the moment they were in his power to inflict on them the punishment which he had often threatened when joking with them. He then proceeded to Rhodes, but as Mithridates was devastating the neighboring regions, he crossed over into Asia, to avoid the appearance of inaction when the allies of the Roman people were in danger. There he levied a band of auxiliaries and drove the king's prefect from the province, thus holding the wavering and irresolute states to their allegiance.
V. While serving as military tribune, the first office which was conferred on him by vote of the people after his return to Rome, he ardently supported the leaders in the attempt to re-establish the authority of the tribunes of the commons, the extent of which Sulla had curtailed. Furthermore, through a bill proposed by one Plotius , he effected the recall of his wife's brother Lucius Cinna, as well as of the others who had taken part with Lepidus in his revolution and after the consul's death had fled to Sertorius; and he personally spoke in favor of the measure.
VI. When quaestor , he pronounced the customary orations from the rostra in praise of his aunt Julia and his wife Cornelia, who had both died. And in the eulogy of his aunt he spoke in the following terms of her paternal and maternal ancestry and that of his own father: ""The family of my aunt Julia is descended by her mother from the kings, and on her father's side is akin to the immortal Gods; for the Marcii Reges (her mother's family name) go back to Ancus Marcius, and the Julii, the family of which ours is a branch, to Venus. Our stock therefore has at once the sanctity of kings, whose power is supreme among mortal men, and the claim to reverence which attaches to the Gods, who hold sway over kings themselves."" In place of Cornelia he took to wife Pompeia, daughter of Quintus Pompeius and granddaughter of Lucius Sulla. But he afterward divorced her , suspecting her of adultery with Publius Clodius; and in fact the report that Clodius had gained access to her in woman's garb during a public religious ceremony was so persistent, that the senate decreed that the pollution of the sacred rites be judicially investigated.
VII. As quaestor it fell to his lot to serve in Hispania Ulterior. When he was there, while making the circuit of the towns, to hold court under commission from the praetor, he came to Gades, and noticing a statue of Alexander the Great in the temple of Hercules, he heaved a sigh, and as if out of patience with his own incapacity in having as yet done nothing noteworthy at a time of life when Alexander had already brought the world to his feet, he straightway asked for his discharge, to grasp the first opportunity for greater enterprises at Rome. Furthermore, when he was dismayed by a dream the following night (for he thought that he had offered violence to his mother) the soothsayers inspired him with high hopes by their interpretation, which was that he was destined to rule the world, since the mother whom he had seen in his power was none other than the earth, which is regarded as the common parent of all mankind.
VIII. Departing therefore before his term was over, he went to the Latin colonies which were in a state of unrest and meditating a demand for citizenship  and he might have spurred them on to some rash act, had not the consuls, in anticipation of that very danger, detained there for a time the legions which had been enrolled for service in Cilicia.
IX. For all that he presently made a more daring attempt at Rome; for a few days before he entered upon his aedileship he was suspected of having made a conspiracy with Marcus Crassus, an ex-consul, and likewise with Publius Sulla and Lucius Autronius, who, after their election to the consulship, had been found guilty of corrupt practices . The design was to set upon the senate at the opening of the year and put to the sword as many as they thought good; then Crassus was to usurp the dictatorship, naming Caesar as his master of horse, and when they had organized the state according to their pleasure, the consulship was to be restored to Sulla and Autronius. This plot is mentioned by Tanusius Geminus in his History, by Marcus Bibulus in his edicts, and by Gaius Curio the elder in his speeches. Cicero too seems to hint at it in a letter to Axius, where he says that Caesar in his consulship established the despotism which he had had in mind when he was aedile. Tanusius adds that Crassus, either conscience-stricken or moved by fear, did not appear on the day appointed for the massacre, and that therefore Caesar did not give the signal which it had been agreed that he should give; and Curio says that the arrangement was that Caesar should let his toga fall from his shoulder. Not only Curio, but Marcus Actorius Naso as well declare that Caesar made another plot with Gnaeus Piso, a young man to whom the province of Hispania had been assigned unasked and out of the regular order, because he was suspected of political intrigues at Rome; that they agreed to rise in revolt at the same time, Piso abroad and Caesar at Rome, aided by the Ambrani and the peoples beyond the Po; but that Piso's death brought both their designs to naught.
X. When aedile , Caesar decorated not only the Comitium and the Forum with its adjacent basilicas, but the Capitol as well, building temporary colonnades for the display of a part of his material. He exhibited combats with wild beasts and stageplays too, both with his colleague and independently. The result was that Caesar alone took all the credit even for what they spent in common, and his colleague Marcus Bibulus openly said that his was the fate of Pollux: ""For,"" said he, ""just as the temple erected in the Forum to the twin brethren, bears only the name of Castor, so the joint liberality of Caesar and myself is credited to Caesar alone."" Caesar gave a gladiatorial show besides, but with somewhat fewer pairs of combatants than he had purposed; for the huge band which he assembled from all quarters so terrified his opponents, that a bill was passed limiting the number of gladiators which anyone was to be allowed to keep in the city.
XI. Having won the goodwill of the masses, Caesar made an attempt through some of the tribunes to have the charge of Egypt given him by a decree of the commons, seizing the opportunity to ask for so irregular an appointment because the citizens of Alexandria had deposed their king, who had been named by the senate an ally and friend of the Roman people, and their action was generally condemned. He failed however because of the opposition of the Optimates ; wishing therefore to impair their prestige in every way he could, he restored the trophies commemorating the victories of Gaius Marius over Jugurtha and over the Cimbri and Teutoni, which Sulla had long since demolished. Furthermore in conducting prosecutions for murder, he included in the number of murderers even those who had received moneys from the public treasury during the proscriptions for bringing in the heads of Roman citizens, although they were expressly exempted by the Cornelian laws.
XII. He also bribed a man to bring a charge of high treason against Gaius Rabirius, who some years before, had rendered conspicuous service to the senate in repressing the seditious designs of the tribune Lucius Saturninus; and when he had been selected by lot to sentence the accused, he did so with such eagerness, that when Rabirius appealed to the people, nothing was so much in his favor as the bitter hostility of his judge.
XIII. After giving up hope of the special commission, he announced his candidacy for the office of pontifex maximus, resorting to the most lavish bribery. Thinking on the enormous debt which he had thus contracted, he is said to have declared to his mother on the morning of the election, as she kissed him when he was starting for the polls, that he would never return except as pontifex. And in fact he so decisively defeated two very strong competitors (for they were greatly his superiors in age and rank), that he polled more votes in their tribes than were cast for both of them in all the tribes.
XIV. When the conspiracy of Catiline was detected , and all the rest of the senate favored inflicting the extreme penalty on those implicated in the plot, Caesar, who was now praetor elect, alone proposed that their goods be confiscated and that they be imprisoned each in a separate town. Nay, more, he inspired such fear in those who favored severer measures, by picturing the hatred which the Roman commons would feel for them for all future time, that Decimus Silanus, consul elect, was not ashamed to give a milder interpretation to his proposal (since it would have been humiliating to change it) alleging that it had been understood in a harsher sense than he intended. Caesar would have prevailed too, for a number had already gone over to him, including Cicero, the consul's brother, had not the address of Marcus Cato kept the wavering senate in line. Yet not even then did he cease to delay the proceedings, but only when an armed troop of Roman knights that stood on guard about the place threatened him with death as he persisted in his headstrong opposition. They even drew their swords and made such passes at him that his friends who sat next him forsook him, while a few had much ado to shield him in their embrace or with their robes. Then, in evident fear, he not only yielded the point, but for the rest of the year kept aloof from the House.
XV. On the first day of his praetorship  he called upon Quintus Catulus to render an account to the people touching the restoration of the CapitoI, proposing a bill for turning over the commission to another . But he withdrew the measure, since he could not cope with the united opposition of the optimates, seeing that they had at once dropped their attendance on the newly elected consuls and hastily gathered in throngs, resolved on an obstinate resistance.
XVI. Nevertheless, when Caecilius Metellus, tribune of the commons, brought forward some bills of a highly seditious nature in spite of the veto of his colleagues, Caesar abetted him and espoused his cause in the stubbornest fashion, until at last both were suspended from the exercise of their public functions by a decree of the senate. Yet in spite of this Caesar had the audacity to continue in office and to hold court, but when he learned that some were ready to stop him by force of arms, he dismissed his lictors, laid aside his robe of office, and slipped off privily to his house, intending to remain in retirement because of the state of the times. Indeed, when the populace on the following day flocked to him quite of their own accord, and with riotous demonstrations offered him their aid in recovering his position, he held them in check. Since this action of his was wholly unexpected, the senate, which had been hurriedly convoked to take action about that very gathering, publicly thanked him through its leading men; then summoning him to the House and lauding him in the strongest terms, they rescinded their former decree and restored him to his rank.
XVII. He again fell into danger by being named among the accomplices of Catiline, both before the commissioner  Novius Niger by an informer called Lucius Vettius and in the senate by Quintus Curius, who had been voted a sum of money from the public funds as the first to disclose the plans of the conspirators. Curius alleged that his information came directly from Catiline, while Vettius actually offered to produce a letter to Catiline in Caesar's hand writing. But Caesar, thinking that such an indignity could in no wise be endured, showed by appealing to Cicero's testimony that he had of his own accord reported to the consul certain details of the plot, and thus prevented Curius from getting the reward. As for Vettius, after his bond was declared forfeit and his goods seized, he was roughly handled by the populace assembled before the rostra, and all but torn to pieces. Caesar then put him in prison, and Novius the commissioner went there too, for allowing an official of superior rank to be arraigned before his tribunal.
XVIII. Being allotted the province of Hispania Ulterior  after his praetorship, Caesar got rid of his creditors, who tried to detain him, by means of sureties and contrary both to precedent and law was on his way before the provinces were provided for ; possibly through fear of a private impeachment or perhaps to respond more promptly to the entreaties of our allies for help. After restoring order in his province, he made off with equal haste, and without waiting for the arrival of his successor, to sue at the same time for a triumph and the consulship. But inasmuch as the day for the elections had already been announced and no account could be taken of Caesar's candidacy unless he entered the city as a private citizen, and since his intrigues to gain exemption from the laws met with general protest, he was forced to forgo the triumph, to avoid losing the consulship.
XIX.  Of the two other candidates for this office, Lucius Lucceius and Marcus Bibulus, Caesar joined forces with the former, making a bargain with him that since Lucceius had less influence but more funds, he should in their common name promise largess to the electors from his own pocket. When this became known, the optimates authorized Bibulus to promise the same amount, being seized with fear that Caesar would stick at nothing when he became ohief magistrate, if he had a colleague who was heart and soul with him. Many of them contributed to the fund, and even Cato did not deny that bribery under such circumstances was for the good of the commonwealth. So Caesar was chosen consul with Bibulus. With the same motives the optimates took care that provinces of the smallest importance should be assigned to the newly elected consuls; that is, mere woods and pastures . Thereupon Caesar, especially incensed by this slight, by every possible attention courted the goodwill of Gnaeus Pompeius, who was at odds with the senate because of its tardiness in ratifying his acts after his victory over king Mithridates . He also patched up a peace between Pompeius and Marcus Crassus, who had been enemies since their consulship, which had been one of constant wrangling. Then  he so made a compact with both of them, that no step should be taken in public affairs which did not suit any one of the three.
XX. Caesar's very first enactment after becoming consul was, that the proceedings both of the senate and of the people should day by day be compiled and published. He also revived a by-gone custom, that during the months when he did not have the fasces an orderly should walk before him, while the lictors followed him. He brought forward an agrarian law too, and when his colleague announced adverse omens , he resorted to arms and drove him from the Forum; and when next day Bibulus made complaint in the senate and no one could be found who ventured to make a motion, or even to express an opinion about so high-handed a proceeding (although decrees had often been passed touching less serious breaches of the peace), Caesar's conduct drove him to such a pitch of desperation, that from that time until the end of his term he did not leave his house, but merely issued proclamations announcing adverse omens.
From that time on Caesar managed all the affairs of state alone and after his own pleasure; so that sundry witty fellows, pretending by way of jest to sign and seal testamentary documents, wrote ""Done in the consulship of Julius and Caesar,"" instead of 'Bibulus and Caesar,"" writing down the same man twice, by name and by surname. Presently too the following verses were on everyone's lips:
""In Caesar's year, not Bibulus', an act took place of late;
For naught do I remember done in Bibulus' consulate.""
The plain called Stellas, which had been devoted to public uses by the men of by-gone days, and the Campanian territory, which had been reserved to pay revenues for the aid of the government, he divided without casting lots  among twenty thousand citizens who had three or more children each. When the publicans asked for relief, he freed them from a third part of their obligation, and openly warned them in contracting for taxes in the future not to bid too recklessly. He freely granted everything else that anyone took it into his head to ask, either without opposition or by intimidating anyone who tried to object. Marcus Cato, who tried to delay proceedings , was dragged from the House by a lictor at Caesar's command and taken off to prison. When Lucius Lucullus was somewhat too outspoken in his opposition, he filled him with such fear of malicious prosecution  that Lucullus actually fell on his knees before him. Because Cicero, while pleading in court, deplored the state of the times, Caesar transferred the orator's enemy Publius Clodius that very same day from the patricians to the plebeians , a thing for which Clodius had for a long time been vainly striving; and that too at the ninth hour . Finally taking action against all the opposition in a body, he bribed an informer to declare that he had been egged on by certain men to murder Gnaeus Pompeius, and to come out upon the rostra and name the guilty parties according to a pre-arranged plot. But when the informer had named one or two to no purpose and not without suspicion of double-dealing, Caesar, hopeless of the success of his over-hasty attempt, is supposed to have had him taken off by poison.
XXI. At about the same time he took to wife Calpurnia, daughter of Lucius Piso, who was to succeed him in the consulship, and affianced his own daughter Julia to Gnaeus Pompeius, breaking a previous engagement with Servilius Caepio, although the latter had shortly before rendered him conspicuous service in his contest with Bibulus. And after this new alliance he began to call upon Pompeius first to give his opinion in the senate, although it had been his habit to begin with Crassus, and it was the rule for the consul in calling for opinions to continue throughout the year the order which he had established on the Kalends of January.
XXII. Backed therefore by his father-in-law and son-in-law, out of all the numerous provinces he made Gallia his choice, as the most likely to enrich him and furnish suitable material for triumphs. At first, it is true, by the bill of Vatinius he received only Gallia Cisalpina with the addition of Illyricum; but presently he was assigned Gallia Comata as well by the senate, since the members feared that even if they should refuse it, the people would give him this also. Transported with joy at this success, he could not keep from boasting a few days later before a crowded house, that having gained his heart's desire to the grief and lamentation of his opponents, he would therefore from that time mount on their heads ; and when someone insultingly remarked that that would be no easy matter for any woman, he replied in the same vein that Semiramis too had been queen in Syria and the Amazons in days of old had held sway over a great part of Asia.
XXIII. When at the close of his consulship the praetors Gaius Memmius and Lucius Domitius moved an inquiry into his conduct during the previous year, Caesar laid the matter before the senate; and when they failed to take it up, and three days had been wasted in fruitless wrangling, went off to his province. Whereupon his quaestor was at once arraigned on several counts, as a preliminary to his own impeachment. Presently he himself too was prosecuted by Lucius Antistius, tribune of the commons, and it was only by appealing to the whole college that he contrived not to be brought to trial, on the ground that he was absent on public service. Then to secure himself for the future, he took great pains always to put the magistrates for the year under personal obligation, and not to aid any candidates or suffer any to be elected, save such as guaranteed to defend him in his absence. And he did not hesitate in some cases to exact an oath to keep this pledge or even a written contract.
XXIV.  When, however, Lucius Domitius, candidate for the consulship, openly threatened to effect as consul what he had been unable to do as praetor, and to take his armies from him, Caesar compelled Pompeius and Crassus to come to Luca, a city in his province, where he prevailed on them to stand for a second consulship, to defeat Domitius; and he also succeeded through their influence in having his term as governor of Gallia made five years longer. Encouraged by this, he added to the legions which he had received from the state others at his own cost, one actually composed of men of Gallia Transalpina and bearing a Gallic name too (for it was called Alauda ), which he trained in the Roman tactics and equipped with Roman arms; and later on he gave every man of it citizenship. After that he did not let slip any pretext for war, however unjust and dangerous it might be, picking quarrels as well with allied, as with hostile and barbarous nations; so that once the senate decreed that a commission be sent to inquire into the condition of the Gallic provinces, and some even recommended that Caesar be handed over to the enemy. But as his enterprises prospered, thanksgivings were appointed in his honor oftener and for longer periods than for anyone before his time.
XXV.  During the nine years of his command this is in substance what he did. All that part of Gallia which is bounded by the Pyrenees, the Alps and the Cévennes, and by the Rhine and Rhone rivers, a circuit of some 3,200 miles , with the exception of some allied states which had rendered him good service, he reduced to the form of a province; and imposed upon it a yearly tribute of 40,000,000 sesterces. He was the first Roman to build a bridge and attack the Germans beyond the Rhine; and he inflicted heavy losses upon them. He invaded the Britons too, a people unknown before, vanquished them, and exacted moneys and hostages. Amid all these successes he met with adverse fortune but three times in all: in Britannia, where his fleet narrowly escaped destruction in a violent storm; in Gallia, when one of his legions was routed at Gergovia; and on the borders of Germania, when his lieutenants Titurius and Aurunculeius were ambushed and slain.
XXVI. Within this same space of time he lost first his mother, then his daughter, and soon afterwards his grandchild. Meanwhile, as the community was aghast at the murder of Publius Clodius, the senate had voted that only one consul should be chosen, and expressly named Gnaeus Pompeius. When the tribunes planned to make him Pompeius' colleague, Caesar urged them rather to propose to the people that he be permitted to stand for a second consulship without coming to Rome, when the term of his governorship drew near its end, to prevent his being forced for the sake of the office to leave his province prematurely and without finishing the war. On the granting of this, aiming still higher and flushed with hope, he neglected nothing in the way of lavish expenditure or of favors to anyone, either in his public capacity or privately. He began a forum with the proceeds of his spoils, the ground for which cost more than a hundred million sesterces. He announced a combat of gladiators and a feast for the people in memory of his daughter, a thing quite without precedent. To raise the expectation of these events to the highest possible pitch, he had the material for the banquet prepared in part by his own household, although he had let contracts to the markets as well. He gave orders too that whenever famous gladiators fought without winning the favor of the people , they should be rescued by force and kept for him. He had the novices trained, not in a gladiatorial school by professionals, but in private houses by Roman knights and even by senators who were skilled in arms, earnestly beseeching them, as is shown by his own letters, to give the recruits individual attention and personally direct their exercises. He doubled the pay of the legions for all time. Whenever grain was plentiful, he distributed it to them without stint or measure, and now and then gave each man a slave from among the captives.
XXVII. Moreover, to retain his relationship and friendship with Pompeius, Caesar offered him his sister's granddaughter Octavia in marriage, although she was already the wife of Gaius Marcellus, and asked for the hand of Pompeius' daughter, who was promised to Faustus Sulla. When he had put all Pompeius' friends under obligation, as well as the great part of the senate, through loans made without interest or at a low rate, he lavished gifts on men of all other classes, both those whom he invited to accept his bounty and those who applied to him unasked, including even freedmen and slaves who were special favorites of their masters or patrons. In short, he was the sole and ever ready help of all who were in legal difficulties or in debt and of young spendthrifts, excepting only those whose burden of guilt or of poverty was so heavy, or who were so given up to riotous living, that even he could not save them; and to these he declared in the plainest terms that what they needed was a civil war.
XXVIII. He took no less pains to win the devotion of princes and provinces all over the world, offering prisoners to some by the thousand as a gift, and sending auxiliary troops to the aid of others whenever they wished, and as often as they wished, without the sanction of the senate or people, besides adorning the principal cities of Asia and Graecia with magnificent public works, as well as those of Italia and the provinces of Gallia and Hispania. At last , when all were thunder-struck at his actions and wondered what their purpose could be, the consul Marcus Claudius Marcellus, after first making proclamation that he purposed to bring before the senate a matter of the highest public moment, proposed that a successor to Caesar be appointed before the end of his term, on the ground that the war was ended, peace was established, and the victorious army ought to be disbanded; also that no account be taken of Caesar at the elections, unless he were present, since Pompeius' subsequent action  had not annulled the decree of the people. And it was true that when Pompeius proposed a bill touching the privileges of officials, in the clause where he debarred absentees from candidacy for office he forgot to make a special exception in Caesar's case, and did not correct the oversight until the law had been inscribed on a tablet of bronze and deposited in the treasury. Not content with depriving Caesar of his provinces and his privilege, Marcellus also moved that the colonists whom Caesar had settled in Novum Comum by the bill of Vatinius should lose their citizenship, on the ground that it had been given from political motives and was not authorized by the law.
XXIX. Greatly troubled by these measures, and thinking, as they say he was often heard to remark, that now that he was the leading man of the state, it was harder to push him down from the first place to the second than it would be from the second to the lowest, Caesar stoutly resisted Marcellus, partly through vetoes of the tribunes and partly through the other consul, Servius Sulpicius. When next year Gaius Marcellus, who had succeeded his cousin Marcus as consul, tried the same thing, Caesar by a heavy bribe secured the support of the other consul, Aemilius Paulus, and of Gaius Curio, the most reckless of the tribunes. But seeing that everything was being pushed most persistently, and that even the consuls elect were among the opposition, he sent a written appeal to the senate, not to take from him the privilege which the people had granted, or else to compel the others in command of armies to resign also; feeling sure, it was thought, that he could more readily muster his veterans as soon as he wished, than Pompeius his newly levied troops. He further proposed a compromise to his opponents, that after giving up eight legions and Gallia Transalpina, he be allowed to keep two legions and Gallia Cisalpina, or at least one legion and Illyricum, until he was elected consul.
XXX. But when the senate declined to interfere, and his opponents declared that they would accept no compromise in a matter affecting the public welfare, he crossed to Gallia Citerior, and after hearing all the legal cases, halted at Ravenna, intending to resort to war if the senate took any drastic action against the tribunes of the commons who interposed vetoes in his behalf. Now this was his excuse for the civil war, but it is believed that he had other motives. Gnaeus Pompeius used to declare that since Caesar's own means were not sufficient to complete the works which he had planned, nor to do all that he had led the people to expect on his return, he desired a state of general unrest and turmoil. Others say that he dreaded the necessity of rendering an account for what he had done in his first consulship contrary to the auspices and the laws, and regardless of vetoes; for Marcus Cato often declared, and took oath too, that he would impeach Caesar the moment he had disbanded his army. It was openly said too that if he was out of office on his return, he would be obliged, like Milo , to make his defence in a court hedged about by armed men. The latter opinion is the more credible one in view of the assertion of Asinius Pollio, that when Caesar at the battle of Pharsalus saw his enemies slain or in flight, he said, word for word: ""They would have it so. Even I, Gaius Caesar, after so many great deeds, should have been found guilty, if I had not turned to my army for help."" Some think that habit had given him a love of power, and that weighing the strength of his adversaries against his own, he grasped the opportunity of usurping the despotism which had been his heart's desire from early youth. Cicero too was seemingly of this opinion, when he wrote in the third book of his De Officiis  that Caesar ever had upon his lips these lines of Euripides , of which Cicero himself adds a version:
'If wrong may e'er be right, for a throne's sake
Were wrong most right:---be God in all else feared.'
XXXI.  Accordingly, when word came that the veto of the tribunes had been set aside and they themselves had left the city, he at once sent on a few cohorts with all secrecy, and then, to disarm suspicion, concealed his purpose by appearing at a public show, inspecting the plans of a gladiatorial school which he intended building, and joining as usual in a banquet with a large company. It was not until after sunset that he set out very privily with a small company, taking the mules from a bakeshop hard by and harnessing them to a carriage; and when his lights went out and he lost his way, he was astray for some time, but at last found a guide at dawn and got back to the road on foot by narrow bypaths. Then, overtaking his cohorts at the river Rubicon, which was the boundary of his province, he paused for a while, and realizing what a step he was taking, he turned to those about him and said: 'Even yet we may draw back; but once cross yon little bridge, and the whole issue is with the sword.""
XXXII. As he stood in doubt, this sign was given him. On a sudden there appeared hard by a being of wondrous stature and beauty, who sat and played upon a reed; and when not only the shepherds flocked to hear him, but many of the soldiers left their posts, and among them some of the trumpeters, the apparition snatched a trumpet from one of them, rushed to the river, and sounding the war-note with mighty blast, strode to the opposite bank. Then Caesar cried: "" Take we the course which the signs of the gods and the false dealing of our foes point out. The die is cast .
XXXIII. Accordingly, crossing with his army, and welcoming the tribunes of the plebeians, who had come to him after being driven from Rome, he harangued the soldiers with tears, and rending his robe from his breast besought their faithful service. It is even thought that he promised every man the estate of an eques, but that came of a misunderstanding; for since he often pointed to the finger of his left hand as he addressed them and urged them on, declaring that to satisfy all those who helped him to defend his honor he would gladly tear his very ring from his hand, those on the edge of the assembly, who could see him better than they could hear his words, assumed that he said what his gesture seemed to mean; and so the report went about that he had promised them the right of the ring and four hundred thousand sesterces as well .
XXXIV. The sum total of his movements after that is, in their order, as follows: He overran Umbria, Picenum, and Etruria, took prisoner Lucius Domitius, who had been irregularly named his successor, and was holding Corfinium with a garrison, let him go free, and then proceeded along the Adriatic to Brundisium, where Pompeius and the consuls had taken refuge, intending to cross the sea as soon as might be. After vainly trying by every kind of hindrance to prevent their sailing, he marched off to Rome, and after calling the senate together to discuss public business, went to attack Pompeius' strongest forces, which were in Hispania under command of three of his lieutenants--Marcus Petreius, Lucius Afranius, and Marcus Varro---saying to his friends before he left ""I go to meet an army without a leader, and I shall return to meet a leader without an army."" And in fact, though his advance was delayed by the siege of Massilia, which had shut its gates against him, and by extreme scarcity of supplies, he nevertheless quickly gained a complete victory.
XXXV.  Returning thence to Rome, he crossed into Macedonia, and after blockading Pompeius for almost four months behind mighty ramparts, finally routed him in the battle at Pharsalus, followed him in his flight to Alexandria, and when he learned that his rival had been slain, made war on King Ptolemy, whom he perceived to be plotting against his own safety as well; a war in truth of great difficulty, convenient neither in time nor place, but carried on during the winter season, within the walls of a well-provisioned and crafty foeman, while Caesar himself was without supplies of any kind and ill-prepared. Victor in spite of all, he turned over the rule of Egypt to Cleopatra and her younger brother , fearing that if he made a province of it, it might one day under a headstrong governor be a source of revolution. From Alexandria he crossed to Syria, and from there went to Pontus, spurred on by the news that Pharnaces, son of Mithridates the Great, had taken advantage of the situation to make war, and was already flushed with numerous successes; but Caesar vanquished him in a single battle within five days after his arrival and four hours after getting sight of him, often remarking on Pompeius' good luck in gaining his principal fame as a general by victories over such feeble foemen. Then he overcame Scipio and Juba , who were patching up the remnants of their party in Africa, and the sons of Pompeius in Spain .
XXXVI. In all the civil wars he suffered not a single disaster except through his lieutenants, of whom Gaius Curio perished in Africa, Gaius Antonius fell into the hands of the enemy in Illyricum, Publius Dolabella lost a fleet also off Illyricum, and Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus an army in Pontus. Personally he always fought with the utmost success, and the issue was never even in doubt save twice: once at Dyrrachium, where he was put to flight, and said of Pompeius, who failed to follow up his success, that he did not know how to use a victory; again in Spain, in the final struggle, when, believing the battle lost, he actually thought of suicide.
XXXVII. Having ended the wars, he celebrated five triumphs, four in a single month, but at intervals of a few days, after vanquishing Scipio; and another on defeating Pompeius' sons. The first and most splendid was the Gallic triumph, the next the Alexandrian, then the Pontic, after that the African, and finally the Hispanic, each differing from the rest in its equipment and display of spoils. As he rode through the Velabrum on the day of his Gallic triumph, the axle of his chariot broke, and he was all but thrown out; and he mounted the Capitol by torchlight, with forty elephants bearing lamps on his right and his left. In his Pontic triumph he displayed among the show-pieces of the procession an inscription of but three words, ""I came, I saw, I conquered,""  not indicating the events of the war, as the others did, but the speed with which it was finished.
XXXVIII. To each and every foot-soldier of his veteran legions he gave twenty-four thousand sesterces by way of plunder, over and above the two thousand apiece which he had paid them at the beginning of the civil strife. He also assigned them lands, but not side by side, to avoid dispossessing any of the former owners. To every man of the people, besides ten pecks of grain and the same number of pounds of oil, he distributed the three hundred sesterces which he had promised at first, and one hundred apiece because of the delay. He also remitted a year's rent in Rome to tenants who paid two thousand sesterces or less, and in Italy up to five hundred sesterces. He added a banquet and a dole of meat, and after his Hispanic victory two dinners; for deeming that the former of these had not been served with a liberality creditable to his generosity, he gave another five days later on a most lavish scale.
XXXIX. He gave entertainments of divers kinds: a combat of gladiators and also stage-plays in every ward all over the city, performed too by actors of all languages, as well as races in the circus, athletic contests, and a sham sea-fight. In the gladiatorial contest in the Forum Furius Leptinus, a man of praetorian stock, and Quintus Calpenus, a former senator and pleader at the bar, fought to a finish. A Pyrrhic dance was performed by the sons of the princes of Asia and Bithynia. During the plays Decimus Laberius, a Roman eques, acted a farce of his own composition, and having been presented with five hundred thousand sesterces and a gold ring , passed from the stage through the orchestra and took his place in the fourteen rows . For the races the circus was lengthened at either end and a broad canal was dug all about it; then young men of the highest rank drove four-horse and two-horse chariots and rode pairs of horses, vaulting from one to the other. The game called Troy was performed by two troops, of younger and of older boys. Combats with wild beasts were presented on five successive days, and last of all there was a battle between two opposing armies, in which five hundred foot-soldiers, twenty elephants, and thirty horsemen engaged on each side. To make room for this, the goals were taken down and in their place two camps were pitched over against each other. The athletic competitions lasted for three days in a temporary stadium built for the purpose in the region of the Campus Martius. For the naval battle a pool was dug in the lesser Codeta and there was a contest of ships of two, three, and four banks of oars, belonging to the Tyrian and Egyptian fleets, manned by a large force of fighting men. Such a throng flocked to all these shows from every quarter, that many strangers had to lodge in tents pitched in the streets or along the roads, and the press was often such that many were crushed to death, including two senators.
XL. Then turning his attention to the reorganisation of the state, he reformed the calendar, which the negligence of the pontiffs had long since so disordered, through their privilege of adding months or days at pleasure, that the harvest festivals did not come in summer nor those of the vintage in the autumn; and he adjusted the year to the sun's course by making it consist of three hundred and sixty-five days, abolishing the intercalary month, and adding one day every fourth year . Furthermore, that the correct reckoning of seasons might begin with the next Kalends of January, he inserted two other months between those of November and December; hence the year in which these arrangements were made was one of fifteen months, including the intercalary month, which belonged to that year according to the former custom.
XLI. He filled the vacancies in the senate, enrolled additional patricians, and increased the number of praetors, aediles, and quaestors, as well as of the minor officials; he reinstated those who had been degraded by official action of the censors or found guilty of bribery by verdict of the jurors. He shared the elections with the people on this basis: that except in the case of the consulship, half of the magistrates should be appointed by the people's choice, while the rest should be those whom he had personally nominated. And these he announced in brief notes like the following, circulated in each tribe: 'Caesar the Dictator to this or that tribe. I commend to you so and so, to hold their positions by your votes."" He admitted to office even the sons of those who had been proscribed. He limited the right of serving as jurors to two classes, the equestrian and senatorial orders, disqualifying the third class, the tribunes of the treasury. He made the enumeration of the people neither in the usual manner nor place, but from street to street aided by the owners of blocks of houses, and reduced the number of those who received grain at public expense from three hundred and twenty thousand to one hundred and fifty thousand. And to prevent the calling of additional meetings at any future time for purposes of enrolment, he provided that the places of such as died should be filled each year by the praetors from those who were not on the list.
XLII. Moreover, to keep up the population of the city, depleted as it was by the assignment of eighty thousand citizens to colonies across the sea, he made a law that no citizen older than twenty or younger than forty, who was not detained by service in the army, should be absent from Italia for more than three successive years; that no senator's son should go abroad except as the companion of a magistrate or on his staff; and that those who made a business of grazing should have among their herdsmen at least one-third who were men of free birth. He conferred citizenship on all who practiced medicine at Rome, and on all teachers of the liberal arts, to make them more desirous of living in the city and to induce others to resort to it. As to debts, he disappointed those who looked for their cancellation, which was often agitated, but finally decreed that the debtors should satisfy their creditors according to a valuation of their possessions at the price which they had paid for them before the civil war, deducting from the principal whatever interest had been paid in cash or pledged through bankers; an arrangement which wiped out about a fourth part of their indebtedness. He dissolved all collegii , except those of ancient foundation. He increased the penalties for crimes; and inasmuch as the rich involved themselves in guilt with less hesitation because they merely suffered exile, without any loss of property, he punished murderers of freemen by the confiscation of all their goods, as Cicero writes, and others by the loss of one-half.
XLIII. He administered justice with the utmost conscientiousness and strictness. Those convicted of extortion he even dismissed from the senatorial order. He annulled the marriage of an ex-praetor, who had married a woman the very day after her divorce, although there was no suspicion of adultery. He imposed duties on foreign wares. He denied the use of litters and the wearing of scarlet robes or pearls to all except to those of a designated position and age, and on set days. In particular, he enforced the law against extravagance, setting watchmen in various parts of the market, to seize and bring to him dainties which were exposed for sale in violation of the law; and sometimes he sent his lictors and soldiers to take from a dining-room any articles which had escaped the vigilance of his watchmen, even after they had been served.
XLIV. In particular, for the adornment and convenience of the city, also for the protection and extension of the Empire, he formed more projects and more extensive ones every day; first of all, to rear a temple to Mars, greater than any in existence, filling up and levelling the pool in which he had exhibited the sea-fight, and to build a theater of vast size, sloping down from the Tarpeian Rock; to reduce the civil code to fixed limites, and of the vast and prolix mass of statutes to include only the best and most essential in a limited number of volumes; to open to the public the greatest possible libraries of Greek and Latin books, assigning to Marcus Varro the charge of procuring and classifying them; to drain the Pomptine marshes; to let out the water from Lake Fucinus; to make a highway from the Adriatic across the summit of the Apennines as far as the Tiber; to cut a canal through the Isthmus; to check the Dacians, who had poured into Pontus and Thrace; then to make war on the Parthians by way of Lesser Armenia, but not to risk a battle with them until he had first tested their mettle. All these enterprises and plans were cut short by his death. But before I speak of that, it will not be amiss to describe briefly his personal appearance, his dress, his mode of life, and his character, as well as his conduct in civil and military life.
XLV. He is said to have been tall of stature, with a fair complexion, shapely limbs, a somewhat full face, and keen black eyes; sound of health, except that towards the end he was subject to sudden fainting fits and to nightmare as well. He was twice attacked by the falling sickness  during his campaigns. He was somewhat overnice in the care of his person, being not only carefully trimmed and shaved, but even having superfluous hair plucked out, as some have charged; while his baldness was a disfigurement which troubled him greatly, since he found that it was often the subject of the gibes of his detractors. Because of it he used to comb forward his scanty locks from the crown of his head, and of all the honors voted him by the senate and people there was none which he received or made use of more gladly than the privilege of wearing a laurel wreath at all times. They say, too, that he was remarkable in his dress; that he wore a senator's tunic  with fringed sleeves reaching to the wrist, and always had a girdle  over it, though rather a loose one; and this, they say, was the occasion of Sulla's mot, when he often warned the nobles to keep an eye on the ill-girt boy.
XLVI. He lived at first in the Subura in a modest house, but after he became pontifex maximus, in the official residence on the Sacred Way. Many have written that he was very fond of elegance and luxury; that having laid the foundations of a countryhouse on his estate at Nemi and finished it at great cost, he tore it all down because it did not suit him in every particular, although at the time he was still poor and heavily in debt; and that he carried tesselated and mosaic floors about with him on his campaigns.
XLVII. They say that he was led to invade Britannia by the hope of getting pearls, and that in comparing their size he sometimes weighed them with his own hand; that he was always a most enthusiastic collector of gems, carvings, statues, and pictures by early artists; also of slaves of exceptional figure and training at enormous prices, of which he himself was so ashamed that he forbade their entry in his accounts.
XLVIII. It is further reported that in the provinces he gave banquets constantly in two dining halls, in one of which his officers or Greek companions, in the other Roman civilians and the more distinguished of the provincials reclined at table. He was so punctilious and strict in the management of his household, in small matters as well as in those of greater importance, that he put his baker in irons for serving him with one kind of bread and his guests with another; and he inflicted capital punishment on a favorite freedman for adultery with the wife of a Roman eques, although no complaint was made against him.
XLIX. There was no stain on his reputation for chastity except his intimacy with King Nicomedes, but that was a deep and lasting reproach, which laid him open to insults from every quarter. I say nothing of the notorious lines of Licinius Calvus:
Whate'er Bithynia had, and Caesar's paramour.
I pass over, too, the invectives of Dolabella and the elder Curio, in which Dolabella calls him 'the queen's rival, the inner partner of the royal couch,' and Curio, 'the brothel of Nicomedes and the stew of Bithynia.' I take no account of the edicts of Bibulus, in which he posted his colleague as 'the queen of Bithynia,' saying that 'of old he was enamored of a king, but now of a king's estate.' At this same time, so Marcus Brutus declares, one Octavius, a man whose disordered mind made him somewhat free with his tongue, after saluting Gnaeus Pompeius as Rex  in a crowded assembly, greeted Caesar as Regina . But Gaius Memmius makes the direct charge that he acted as cup-bearer to Nicomedes with the rest of his wantons at a large dinner-party, and that among the guests were some merchants from Rome, whose names Memmius gives. Cicero, indeed, is not content with having written in sundry letters that Caesar was led by the king's attendants to the royal apartments, that he lay on a golden couch arrayed in purple, and that the virginity of this son of Venus was lost in Bithynia; but when Caesar was once addressing the senate in defence of Nysa, daughter of Nicomedes, and was enumerating his obligations to the king, Cicero cried: ""No more of that, pray, for it is well known what he gave you, and what you gave him in turn."" Finally, in his Gallic triumph his soldiers, among the bantering songs which are usually sung by those who follow the chariot, shouted these lines, which became a by-word:
""All the Gauls did Caesar vanquish, Nicomedes vanquished him;
Lo! now Caesar rides in triumph, victor over all the Gauls,
Nicomedes does not triumph, who subdued the conqueror.""
L. That he was unbridled and extravagant in his intrigues is the general opinion, and that he seduced many illustrious women, among them Postumia, wife of Servius Sulpicius, Lollia, wife of Aulus Gabinius, Tertulla, wife of Marcus Crassus, and even Gnaeus Pompeius' wife Mucia. At all events there is no doubt that Pompeius was taken to task by the elder and the younger Curio, as well as by many others, because through a desire for power he had afterwards married the daughter of a man on whose account he divorced a wife who had borne him three children and whom he had often referred to with a groan as an Aegisthus. But beyond all others Caesar loved Servilia, the mother of Marcus Brutus, for whom in his first consulship he bought a pearl costing six million sesterces. During the civil war, too, besides other presents, he knocked down some fine estates to her in a public auction at a nominal price, and when some expressed their surprise at the low figure, Cicero wittily remarked: ""It's a better bargain than you think, for there is a third off'---and in fact it was thought that Servilia was prostituting her own daughter Tertia to Caesar .
LI. That he did not refrain from intrigues in the provinces is shown in particular by this couplet, which was also shouted by the soldiers in his Gallic triumph:
'Men of Rome, keep close your consorts, here's a bald adulterer.
Gold in Gallia you spent in dalliance, which you borrowed here in Rome.""
LII. He had love affairs with queens too, including Eunoe the Mauretanian, wife of Bogudes, on whom, as well as on her husband, he bestowed many splendid presents, as Naso writes; but above all with Cleopatra, with whom he often feasted until daybreak, and he would have gone through Egypt with her in her state-barge almost to Aethiopia , had not his soldiers refused to follow him. Finally he called her to Rome and did not let her leave until he had ladened her with high honors and rich gifts, and he allowed her to give his name to the child which she bore. In fact, according to certain Greek writers, this child was very like Caesar in looks and carriage. Marcus Antonius declared to the senate that Caesar had really acknowledged the boy, and that Gaius Matius, Gaius Oppius, and other friends of Caesar knew this. Of these Gaius Oppius, as if admitting that the situation required apology and defence, published a book, to prove that the child whom Cleopatra fathered on Caesar was not his. Helvius Cinna, tribune of the plebeians, admitted to several that he had a bill drawn up in due form, which Caesar had ordered him to propose to the people in his absence, making it lawful for Caesar to marry what wives he wished, and as many as he wished, 'for the purpose of begetting children' . But to remove all doubt that he had an evil reputation both for shameless vice and for adultery, I have only to add that the elder Curio in one of his speeches calls him ""every woman's man and every man's woman.""
LIII. That he drank very little wine not even his enemies denied. There is a saying of Marcus Cato that Caesar was the only man who undertook to overthrow the state when sober. Even in the matter of food Gaius Oppius tells us that he was so indifferent, that once when his host served stale oil instead of fresh, and the other guests would have none of it, Caesar partook even more plentifully than usual, not to seem to charge his host with carelessness or lack of manners.
LIV. Neither when in command of armies nor as a magistrate at Rome did he show a scrupulous integrity; for as certain men have declared in their memoirs, when he was proconsul in Hispania, he not only begged money from the allies, to help pay his debts, but also attacked and sacked some towns of the Lusitanians although they did not refuse his terms and opened their gates to him on his arrival. In Gallia he pillaged shrines and temples of the gods filled with offerings, and oftener sacked towns for the sake of plunder than for any fault. In consequence he had more gold than he knew what to do with, and offered it for sale throughout Italia and the provinces at the rate of three thousand sesterces the pound. In his first consulship he stole three thousand pounds of gold from the Capitol, replacing it with the same weight of gilded bronze. He made alliances and thrones a matter of barter, for he extorted from Ptolemy alone in his own name and that of Pompeius nearly six thousand talents, while later on he met the heavy expenses of the civil wars and of his triumphs and entertainments by the most bare-faced pillage and sacrilege.
LV. In eloquence and in the art of war he either equalled or surpassed the fame of their most eminent representatives. After his accusation of Dolabella, he was without question numbered with the leading advocates. At all events, when Cicero reviews the orators in his Brutus, he says that he does not see to whom Caesar ought to yield the palm, declaring that his style is elegant as well as transparent, even grand and in a sense noble. Again in a letter to Cornelius Nepos he writes thus of Caesar: ""Come now, what orator would you rank above him of those who have devoted themselves to nothing else? Who has cleverer or more frequent epigrams? Who is either more picturesque or more choice in diction?"" He appears, at least in his youth, to have imitated the manner of Caesar Strabo, from whose speech entitled Pro Sardis he actually transferred some passages word for word to a trial address of his own. He is said to have delivered himself in a high-pitched voice with impassioned action and gestures, which were not without grace. He left several speeches, including some which are attributed to him on insufficient evidence. Augustus had good reason to think that the speech Pro Quintus Metellus was rather taken down by shorthand writers who could not keep pace with his delivery, than published by Caesar himself; for in some copies I find that even the title is not Pro Metellus, but, Quam scripsit Metello  although the discourse purports to be from Caesar's lips, defending Metellus and himself against the charges of their common detractors. Augustus also questions the authenticity of the address Apud milites quoque in Hispania, although there are two sections of it, one purporting to have been spoken at the first battle, the other at the second when Asinius Pollio writes that because of the sudden onslaught of the enemy, he actually did not have time to make an harangue.
LVI. He left memoirs too of his deeds in the Gallic war and in the civil strife with Pompeius; for the author of the Alexandrian, African, and Hispanic Wars is unknown; some think it was Oppius, others Hirtius, who also supplied the final book of the Gallic War, which Caesar left unwritten. With regard to Caesar's memoirs Cicero, also in the Brutus speaks in the following terms: ""He wrote memoirs which deserve the highest praise; they are naked in their simplicity, straightforward yet graceful, stripped of all rhetorical adornment, as of a garment; but while his purpose was to supply material to others, on which those who wished to write history might draw, he haply gratified silly folk, who will try to use the curling-irons on his narrative, but he has kept men of any sense from touching the subject."" Of these same memoirs Hirtius uses this emphatic language: ""They are so highly rated in the judgment of all men, that he seems to have deprived writers of an opportunity, rather than given them one; yet our admiration for this feat is greater than that of others; for they know how well and faultlessly he wrote, while we know besides how easily and rapidly he finished his task."" Asinius Pollio thinks that they were put together somewhat carelessly and without strict regard for truth; since in many cases Caesar was too ready to believe the accounts which others gave of their actions, and gave a perverted account of his own, either designedly or perhaps from forgetfulness; and he thinks that he intended to rewrite and revise them. He left besides a work in two volumes De Analogia, the same number of Anti-Catones , in addition to a poem, entitled Iter . He wrote the first of these works while crossing the Alps and returning to his army from Gallia Citerior, where he heard lawsuits; the second about the time of the battle of Munda, and the third in the course of a twenty-four days' journey from Rome to Hispania Ulterior. Some letters of his to the senate are also preserved, and he seems to have been the first to reduce such documents to pages and the form of a note-book , whereas previously consuls and generals sent their reports written right across the sheet . There are also letters of his to Cicero, as well as to his intimates on private affairs, and in the latter, if he had anything confidential to say, he wrote it in cipher, that is, by so changing the order of the letters of the alphabet, that not a word could be made out. If anyone wishes to decipher these, and get at their meaning, he must substitute the fourth letter of the alphabet, namely D, for A, and so with the others. We also have mention of certain writings of his boyhood and early youth, such as the Laudes Herculis , a tragedy Oedipus, and a Dicta Collectanea ; but Augustus forbade the publication of all these minor works in a very brief and frank letter sent to Pompeius Macer, whom he had selected to set his libraries in order.
LVII. He was highly skilled in arms and horsemanship, and of incredible powers of endurance. On the march he headed his army, sometimes on horseback, but oftener on foot, bareheaded both in the heat of the sun and in rain. He covered great distances with incredible speed, making a hundred miles a day in a hired carriage and with little baggage, swimming the rivers which barred his path or crossing them on inflated skins, and very often arriving before the messengers sent to announce his coming.
LVIII. In the conduct of his campaigns it is a question whether he was more cautious or more daring, for he never led his army where ambuscades were possible without carefully reconnoitering the country, and he did not cross to Britannia without making personal inquiries about the harbors, the course, and the approach to the island. But on the other hand, when news came that his camp in Germania was beleaguered, he made his way to his men through the enemies' pickets, disguised as a Gaul. He crossed from Brundisium to Dyrrachium in winter time, running the blockade of the enemy's fleets; and when the troops which he had ordered to follow him delayed to do so, and he had sent to fetch them many times in vain, at last in secret and alone he boarded a small boat at night with his head muffled up; and he did not reveal who he was, or suffer the helmsman to give way to the gale blowing in their teeth, until he was all but overwhelmed by the waves.
LIX. No regard for religion ever turned him from any undertaking, or even delayed him. Though the victim escaped as he was offering sacrifice, he did not put off his expedition against Scipio and Juba. Even when he had a fall as he disembarked, he gave the omen a favorable turn by crying: ""I hold you fast, Africa."" Furthermore, to make the prophecies ridiculous which declared that the stock of the Scipios was fated to be fortunate and invincible in that province, he kept with him in camp a contemptible fellow belonging to the Cornelian family, to whom the nickname Salvito had been given as a reproach for his manner of life.
LX. He joined battle, not only after planning his movements in advance but on a sudden opportunity, often immediately at the end of a march, and sometimes in the foulest weather, when one would least expect him to make a move. It was not until his later years that he became slower to engage, through a conviction that the oftener he had been victor, the less he ought to tempt fate, and that he could not possibly gain as much by success as he might lose by a defeat. He never put his enemy to flight without also driving him from his camp, thus giving him no respite in his panic. When the issue was doubtful, he used to send away the horses, and his own among the first, to impose upon his troops the greater necessity of standing their ground by taking away that aid to flight.
LXI. He rode a remarkable horse, too, with feet that were almost human; for its hoofs were cloven in such a way as to look like toes. This horse was foaled on his own place, and since the soothsayers had declared that it foretold the rule of the world for its master, he reared it with the greatest care, and was the first to mount it, for it would endure no other rider. Afterwards, too, he dedicated a statue of it before the temple of Venus Genetrix.
LXII. When his army gave way, he often rallied it single-handed, planting himself in the way of the fleeing men, laying hold of them one by one, and even catching them by the throat and forcing them to face the enemy; that, too, when they were in such a panic that an eagle-bearer made a pass at him with the point  as he tried to stop him, while another left the standard in Caesar's hand when he would hold him back.
LXIII. His presence of mind was no less renowned, and the instances of it will appear even more striking. After the battle of Pharsalus, when he had sent on his troops and was crossing the strait of the Hellespont in a small passenger boat, he met Lucius Cassius, of the hostile party, with ten armored ships, and made no attempt to escape, but went to meet Cassius and actually urged him to surrender; and Cassius sued for mercy and was taken on board.
LXIV. At Alexandria, while assaulting a bridge, he was forced by a sudden sally of the enemy to take to a small skiff; when many others threw themselves into the same boat, he plunged into the sea, and after swimming for two hundred paces, got away to the nearest ship, holding up his left hand all the way, so as not to wet some papers which he was carrying, and dragging his cloak after him with his teeth, to keep the enemy from getting it as a trophy.
LXV. He valued his soldiers neither for their personal character nor their fortune, but solely for their prowess, and he treated them with equal strictness and indulgence; for he did not curb them everywhere and at all times, but only in the presence of the enemy. Then he required the strictest discipline, not announcing the time of a march or a battle, but keeping them ready and alert to be led on a sudden at any moment wheresoever he might wish. He often called them out even when there was no occasion for it, especially on rainy days and holidays. And warning them every now and then that they must keep close watch on him, he would steal away suddenly by day or night and make a longer march than usual, to tire out those who were tardy in following.
LXVI. When they were in a panic through reports about the enemy's numbers, he used to rouse their courage not by denying or discounting the rumours, but by falsely exaggerating the true danger. For instance, when the anticipation of Juba's coming filled them with terror, he called the soldiers together and said: ""Let me tell you that within the next few days the king will be here with ten legions, thirty thousand horsemen, a hundred thousand light-armed troops, and three hundred elephants. Therefore some of you may as well cease to ask further questions or make surmises and may rather believe me, since I know all about it. Otherwise, I shall surely have them shipped on some worn out craft and carried off to whatever lands the wind may blow them.""
LXVII. He did not take notice of all their offences or punish them by rule, but he kept a sharp look out for deserters and mutineers, and chastised them most severely, shutting his eyes to other faults. Sometimes, too, after a great victory he relieved them of all duties and gave them full licence to revel, being in the habit of boasting that his soldiers could fight well even when reeking of perfumes. In the assembly he addressed them not as ""soldiers,"" but by the more fiattering term ""comrades,"" and he kept them in fine trim, furnishing them with arms inlaid with silver and gold, both for show and to make them hold the faster to them in battle, through fear of the greatness of the loss. Such was his love for them that when he heard of the disaster to Titurius, he let his hair and beard grow long, and would not cut them until he had taken vengeance.
LXVIII. In this way he made them most devoted to his interests as well as most valiant. When he began the civil war, every centurion of each legion proposed to supply a horseman from his own savings, and the soldiers one and all offered their service without pay and without rations, the richer assuming the care of the poorer. Throughout the long struggle not one deserted and many of them, on being taken prisoner, refused to accept their lives, when offered them on the condition of consenting to serve against Caesar. They bore hunger and other hardships, both when in a state of siege and when besieging others, with such fortitude, that when Pompeius saw in the works at Dyrrachium a kind of bread made of herbs, on which they were living, he said that he was fighting wild beasts; and he gave orders that it be put out of sight quickly and shown to none of his men, for fear that the endurance and resolution of the foe would break their spirit. How valiantly they fought is shown by the fact that when they suffered their sole defeat before Dyrrachium, they insisted on being punished, and their commander felt called upon rather to console than to chastise them. In the other battles they overcame with ease countless forces of the enemy, though decidedly fewer in number themselves. Indeed one cohort of the sixth legion, when set to defend a redoubt, kept four legions of Pompeius at bay for several hours, though almost all were wounded by the enemy's showers of arrows, of which a hundred and thirty thousand were picked up within the ramparts. And no wonder, when one thinks of the deeds of individual soldiers, either of Cassius Scaeva the centurion, or of Gaius Acilius of the rank and file, not to mention others. Scaeva, with one eye gone, his thigh and shoulder wounded, and his shield bored through in a hundred and twenty places, continued to guard the gate of a fortress put in his charge. Acilius in the sea-fight at Massilia grasped the stern of one of the enemy s ships, and when his right hand was lopped off, rivalling the famous exploit of the Greek hero Cynegirus, boarded the ship and drove the enemy before him with the boss of his shield.
LXIX. They did not mutiny once during the ten years of the Gallic war; in the civil wars they did so now and then, but quickly resumed their duty, not so much owing to any indulgence of their general as to his authority. For he never gave way to them when they were insubordinate, but always boldly faced them, discharging the entire ninth legion in disgrace before Placentia, though Pompey was still in the field, reinstating them unwillingly and only after many abject entreaties, and insisting on punishing the ringleaders.
LXX. Again at Rome, when the men of the Tenth Legion clamored for their discharge and rewards with terrible threats and no little peril to the city, though the war in Africa was then raging, he did not hesitate to appear before them, against the advice of his friends, and to disband them. But with a single word, calling them ""citizens,"" instead of 'soldiers,"" he easily brought them round and bent them to his will; for they at once replied that they were his ""soldiers"" and insisted on following him to Africa, although he refused their service. Even then he punished the most insubordinate by the loss of a third part of the plunder and of the land intended for them.
LXXI. Even when a young man he showed no lack of devotion and fidelity to his dependents. He defended Masintha, a youth of high birth, against King Hiempsal  with such spirit, that in the dispute he caught the king's son Juba by the beard. On Masintha's being declared tributary to the king, he at once rescued him from those who would carry him off and kept him hidden for some time in his own house; and when presently he left for Hispania after his praetorship, he carried the young man off in his own litter, unnoticed amid the crowd that came to see him off and the lictors with their fasces.
LXXII. His friends he treated with invariable kindness and consideration. When Gaius Oppius was his companion on a journey through a wild, woody country and was suddenly taken ill, Caesar gave up to him the only shelter there was, while he himself slept on the ground out-of-doors. Moreover, when he came to power, he advanced some of his friends to the highest positions, even though they were of the humblest origin, and when taken to task for it, flatly declared that if he had been helped in defending his honor by brigands and cut-throats, he would have requited even such men in the same way.
LXXIII. On the other hand he never formed such bitter enmities that he was not glad to lay them aside when opportunity offered. Although Gaius Memmius had made highly caustic speeches against him, to which he had replied with equal bitterness, he went so far as to support Memmius afterwards in his suit for the consulship. When Gaius Calvus, after some scurrilous epigrams, took steps through his friends towards a reconciliation, Caesar wrote to him first and of his own free will. Valerius Catullus, as Caesar himself did not hesitate to say, inflicted a lasting stain on his name by the verses about Mamurra; yet when he apologised, Caesar invited the poet to dinner that very same day, and continued his usual friendly relations with Catullus's father.
LXXIV. Even in avenging wrongs he was by nature most merciful, and when he got hold of the pirates who had captured him, he had them crucified, since he had sworn beforehand that he would do so, but ordered that their throats be cut first. He could never make up his mind to harm Cornelius Phagites, although when he was sick and in hiding the man had waylaid him night after night, and even a bribe had barely saved him from being handed over to Sulla. The slave Philemon, his amanuensis, who had promised Caesar's enemies that he would poison him, he merely punished by death, without torture. When summoned as a witness against Publius Clodius, the paramour of his wife Pompeia, charged on the same count with sacrilege, Caesar declared that he had no evidence, although both his mother Aurelia and his sister Julia had given the same jurors a faithful account of the whole affair; and on being asked why it was then that he had put away his wife, he replied: ""Because I maintain that the members of my family should be free from suspicion, as well as from accusation.""
LXXV. He certainly showed admirable self-restraint and mercy, both in his conduct of the civil war and in the hour of victory. While Pompeius announced that he would treat as enemies those who did not take up arms for the government, Caesar gave out that those who were neutral and of neither party should be numbered with his friends. He freely allowed all those whom he had made centurions on Pompeius' recommendation to go over to his rival. When conditions of surrender were under discussion at Ilerda, and friendly intercourse between the two parties was constant, Afranius and Petreius, with a sudden change of purpose, put to death all of Caesar's soldiers whom they found in their camp; but Caesar could not bring himself to retaliate in kind. At the battle of Pharsalus he cried out, ""Spare your fellow citizens,"" and afterwards allowed each of his men to save any one man he pleased of the opposite party. And it will be found that no Pompeian lost his life except in battle, save only Afranius and Faustus, and the young Lucius Caesar; and it is believed that not even these men were slain by his wish, even though the two former had taken up arms again after being pardoned, while Caesar had not only cruelly put to death the dictator's slaves and freedmen with fire and sword, but had even butchered the wild beasts which he had procured for the entertainment of the people. At last, in his later years, he went so far as to allow all those whom he had not yet pardoned to return to Italy, and to hold magistracies and the command of armies: and he actually set up the statues of Lucius Sulla and Pompey, which had been broken to pieces by the populace. After this, if any dangerous plots were formed against him, or slanders uttered, he preferred to quash rather than to punish them. Accordingly, he took no further notice of the conspiracies which were detected, and of meetings by night, than to make known by proclamation that he was aware of them; and he thought it enough to give public warning to those who spoke ill of him, not to persist in their conduct, bearing with good nature the attacks on his reputation made by the scurrilous volume of Aulus Caecina and the abusive lampoons of Pitholaus.
LXXVI. Yet after all, his other actions and words so turn the scale, that it is thought that he abused his power and was justly slain. For not only did he accept excessive honors, such as an uninterrupted consulship, the dictatorship for life, and the censorship of public morals, as well as the forename Imperator, the surname of Pater Patriae , a statue among those of the kings, and a raised couch in the orchestra ; but he also allowed honors to be bestowed on him which were too great for mortal man: a golden throne in the Senate and on the judgment seat; a chariot and litter  in the procession at the circus; temples, altars, and statues beside those of the gods; a special priest, an additional college of the Luperci, and the calling of one of the months by his name. In fact, there were no honors which he did not receive or confer at pleasure. He held his third and fourth consulships in name only, content with the power of the dictatorship conferred on him at the same time as the consulships. Moreover, in both years he substituted two consuls for himself for the last three months, in the meantime holding no elections except for tribunes and plebeian aediles, and appointing praefects instead of the praetors, to manage the affairs of the city during his absence. When one of the consuls suddenly died the day before the Kalends of January, he gave the vacant office for a few hours to a man who asked for it. With the same disregard of law and precedent he named magistrates for several years to come, bestowed the emblems of consular rank on ten ex-praetors, and admitted to the Senate men who had been given citizenship, and in some cases half-civilized Gauls. He assigned the charge of the mint and of the public revenues to his own slaves, and gave the oversight and command of the three legions which he had left at Alexandria to a favorite of his called Rufo, son of one of his freedmen.
LXXVII. No less arrogant were his public utterances, which Titus Ampius records: that the state was nothing, a mere name without body or form; that Sulla did not know his ABC's when he laid down his dictatorship; that men ought now to be more circumspect in addressing him, and to regard his word as law. So far did he go in his presumption, that when a soothsayer once reported of a sacrifice direful innards without a heart, he said: ""They will be more favorable when I wish it; it should not be regarded as a portent, if a beast has no heart"" .
LXXVIII. But it was the following action in particular that roused deadly hatred against him. When the Senate approached him in a body with many highly honorary decrees, he received them before the temple of Venus Genetrix without rising. Some think that when he attempted to get up, he was held back by Cornelius Balbus; others, that he made no such move at all, but on the contrary frowned angrily on Gaius Trebatius when he suggested that he should rise. And this action of his seemed the more intolerable, because when he himself in one of his triumphal processions rode past the benches of the tribunes, he was so incensed because a member of the college, Pontius Aquila by name, did not rise, that he cried: ""Come then, Aquila, take back the republic from me, you tribune""; and for several days he would not make a promise to any one without adding, ""That is, if Pontius Aquila will allow me.""
LXXIX. To an insult which so plainly showed his contempt for the Senate he added an act of even greater insolence; for at the Latin Festival, as he was returning to the city, amid the extravagant and unprecedented demonstrations of the populace, someone in the press placed on his statue a laurel wreath with a white fillet tied to it ; and when Epidius Marullus and Caesetius Flavus, tribunes of the plebeians, gave orders that the ribbon be removed from the wreath and the man taken off to prison, Caesar sharply rebuked and deposed them, either offended that the hint at regal power had been received with so little favor, or, as he asserted, that he had been robbed of the glory of refusing it. But from that time on he could not rid himself of the odium of having aspired to the title of monarch, although he replied to the plebeians, when they hailed him as king, ""I am Caesar and no king"" , and at the Lupercalia, when the consul Marcus Antonius several times attempted to place a crown upon his head as he spoke from the rostra, he put it aside and at last sent it to the Capitol, to be offered to Jupiter Optimus Maximus. Nay, more, the report had spread in various quarters that he intended to move to Ilium or Alexandria, taking with him the resources of the state, draining Italia by levies, and leaving the charge of the city to his friends; also that at the next meeting of the Senate Lucius Cotta would announce as the decision of the Fifteen , that inasmuch as it was written in the books of fate that the Parthians could be conquered only by a king, Caesar should be given that title.
LXXX. It was this that led the conspirators to hasten in carrying out their designs, in order to avoid giving their assent to this proposal. Therefore the plots which had previously been formed separately, often by groups of two or three, were united in a general conspiracy, since even the populace no longer were pleased with present conditions, but both secretly and openly rebelled at his tyranny and cried out for defenders of their liberty. On the admission of foreigners to the Senate, a placard was posted: ""God bless the Republic! let no one consent to point out the Senate to a newly made senator."" The following verses too were sung everwhere:---
'Caesar led the Gauls in triumph, led them to the senate house;
Then the Gauls put off their breeches, and put on the latus clavus.''
When Quintus Maximus, whom he had appointed consul in his place for three months, was entering the theater, and his lictor called attention to his arrival in the usual manner, a general shout was raised: ""He's no consul!"" At the first election after the deposing of Caesetius and Marullus, the tribunes, several votes were found for their appointment as consuls. Some wrote on the base of Lucius Brutus' statue, ""Oh, that you were still alive""; and on that of Caesar himself:---
'First of all was Brutus consul, since he drove the kings from Rome;
Since this man drove out the consuls, he at last is made our king.""
More than sixty joined the conspiracy against him, led by Gaius Cassius and Marcus and Decimus Brutus. At first they hesitated whether to form two divisions at the elections in the Campus Martius, so that while some hurled him from the bridge  as he summoned the tribes to vote, the rest might wait below and slay him; or to set upon him in the Via Sacra or at the entrance to the theater. When, however, a meeting of the Senate was called for the Ides of March in the curia adjoining the Theater of Gnaeus Pompeius, they readily gave that time and place the preference.
LXXXI. Now Caesar's approaching murder was foretold to him by unmistakable signs. A few months before, when the settlers assigned to the colony at Capua by the Julian Law were demolishing some tombs of great antiquity, to build country houses, and plied their work with the greater vigor because as they rummaged about they found a quantity of vases of ancient workmanship, there was discovered in a tomb, which was said to be that of Capys, the founder of Capua, a bronze tablet, inscribed with Greek words and characters to this purport: ""Whenever the bones of Capys shall be moved, it will come to pass that a son of llium shall be slain at the hands of his kindred, and presently avenged at heavy cost to Italia."" And let no one think this tale a myth or a lie, for it is vouched for by Cornelius Balbus, an intimate friend of Caesar. Shortly before his death, as he was told, the herds of horses which he had dedicated to the river Rubicon when he crossed it, and had let loose without a keeper, stubbornly refused to graze and wept copiously. Again, when he was offering sacrifice, the soothsayer Spurinna warned him to beware of danger, which would come not later than the Ides of March; and on the day before the Ides of that month a little bird called the king-bird flew into the Curia of Pompeius with a sprig of laurel, pursued by others of various kinds from the grove hard by, which tore it to pieces in the hall. In fact the very night before his murder he dreamt now that he was flying above the clouds, and now that he was clasping the hand of Jupiter; and his wife Calpurnia thought that the pediment of their house fell, and that her husband was stabbed in her arms; and on a sudden the door of the room flew open of its own accord. Both for these reasons and because of poor health he hesitated for a long time whether to stay at home and put off what he had planned to do in the senate; but at last, urged by Decimus Brutus not to disappoint the full meeting which had for some time been waiting for him, he went forth almost at the end of the fifth hour; and when a note revealing the plot was handed him by someone on the way, he put it with others which he held in his left hand, intending to read them presently. Then, after several victims had been slain, and he could not get favorable omens, he entered the Senate in defiance of portents, laughing at Spurinna and calling him a false prophet, because the Ides of March were come without bringing him harm; though Spurinna replied that they had of a truth come, but they had not gone.
LXXXII.  As he took his seat, the conspirators gathered about him as if to pay their respects, and straightway Tillius Cimber, who had assumed the lead, came nearer as though to ask something; and when Caesar with a gesture put him off to another time, Cimber caught his toga by both shoulders; then as Caesar cried, ""Why, this is violence!"" one of the Cascas stabbed him from one side just below the throat. Caesar caught Casca's arm and ran it through with his stylus, but as he tried to leap to his feet, he was stopped by another wound. When he saw that he was beset on every side by drawn daggers, he muffled his head in his robe, and at the same time drew down its lap to his feet with his left hand, in order to fall more decently, with the lower part of his body also covered. And in this wise he was stabbed with three and twenty wounds, uttering not a word, but merely a groan at the first stroke, though some have written that when Marcus Brutus rushed at him, he said in Greek, 'You too, my child?"" All the conspirators made off, and he lay there lifeless for some time, until finally three common slaves put him on a litter and carried him home, with one arm hanging down. And of so many wounds none turned out to be mortal, in the opinion of the physician Antistius, except the second one in the breast. The conspirators had intended after slaying him to drag his body to the Tiber, confiscate his property, and revoke his decrees; but they forebore through fear of Marcus Antonius the consul, and Lepidus, the master of horse.
LXXXIII. Then at the request of his father-in-law, Lucius Piso, the will was unsealed and read in Antonius' house, which Caesar had made on the preceding Ides of September at his place near Lavicum , and put in the care of the chief of the Vestals. Quintus Tubero states that from his first consulship until the beginning of the civil war it was his wont to write down Gnaeus Pompeius as his heir, and to read this to the assembled soldiers. In his last will, however, he named three heirs, his sisters' grandsons---Gaius Octavius (to three-fourths of his estate), and Lucius Pinarius and Quintus Pedius (to share the remainder). At the end of the will, too, he adopted Gaius Octavius into his family and gave him his name. He named several of his assassins among the guardians of his son, in case one should be born to him, and Decimus Brutus even among his heirs in the second degree. To the people he left his gardens near the Tiber for their common use and three hundred sesterces to each man.
LXXXIV. When the funeral was announced, a pyre was erected in the Campus Martius near the tomb of Julia, and on the rostra a gilded shrine was placed, made after the model of the temple of Venus Genetrix; within was a couch of ivory with coverlets of purple and gold, and at its head a pillar hung with the robe in which he was slain. Since it was clear that the day would not be long enough for those who offered gifts, they were directed to bring them to the Campus by whatsoever
streets of the city they wished, regardless of any order of precedence. At the funeral games, to rouse pity and indignation at his death, these words from the Armorum of Pacuvius were sung:---- 'Saved I these men that they might murder me?"" and words of a like purport from the Electra of Atilius. Instead of a eulogy the consul Antonius caused a herald to recite the decree of the Senate in which it had voted Caesar all divine and human honors at once, and likewise the oath with which they had all pledged themselves to watch over his personal safety; to which he added a very few words of his own. The bier on the rostra was carried down into the Forum by magistrates and ex-magistrates; and while some were urging that it be burned in the temple of Jupiter of the Capitol, and others in the Curia of Pompeius, on a sudden two beings  with swords by their sides and brandishing a pair of darts set fire to it with blazing torches, and at once the throng of bystanders heaped upon it dry branches, the judgment seats with the benches, and whatever else could serve as an offering. Then the musicians and actors tore off their robes, which they had taken from the equipment of his triumphs and put on for the occasion, rent them to bits and threw them into the flames, and the veterans of the legions the arms with which they had adorned themselves for the funeral; many of the women too, offered up the jewels which they wore and the amulets and robes of their children. At the height of the public grief a throng of foreigners went about lamenting each after the fashion of his country, above all the Jews, who even flocked to the place for several successive nights.
LXXXV. Immediately after the funeral the people ran to the houses of Brutus and Cassius with firebrands, and after being repelled with difficulty, they slew Helvius Cinna when they met him, through a mistake in the name, supposing that he was Cornelius Cinna, who had the day before made a bitter indictment of Caesar and for whom they were looking; and they set his head upon a spear and paraded it about the streets. Afterwards they set up in the Forum a solid column of Numidian marble almost twenty feet high, and inscribed upon it, ""To the Father of his Country."" At the foot of this they continued for a long time to sacrifice, make vows, and settle some of their disputes by an oath in the name of Caesar.
LXXXVI. Caesar left in the minds of some of his friends the suspicion that he did not wish to live longer and had taken no precautions, because of his failing health; and that therefore he neglected the warnings which came to him from portents and from the reports of his friends. Some think that it was because he had full trust in that last decree of the senators and their oath that he dismissed even the armed bodyguard of Hispanic soldiers that formerly attended him. Others, on the contrary, believe that he elected to expose himself once for all to the plots that threatened him on every hand, rather than to be always anxious and on his guard. Some, too, say that he was wont to declare that it was not so much to his own interest as to that of his country that he remain alive; he had long since had his fill of power and glory; but if aught befell him, the Republic would have no peace, but would be plunged in civil strife under much worse conditions.
LXXXVII. About one thing almost all are fully agreed, that he all but desired such a death as he met; for once when he read in Xenophon  how Cyrus in his last illness gave directions for his funeral, he expressed his horror of such a lingering kind of end and his wish for one which was swift and sudden. And the day before his murder, in a conversation which arose at a dinner at the house of Marcus Lepidus, as to what manner of death was most to be desired, he had given his preference to one which was sudden and unexpected.
LXXXVIII.  He died in the fifty-sixth year of his age, and was numbered among the gods, not only by a formal decree, but also in the conviction of the common people. For at the first of the games which his heir Augustus gave in honor of his apotheosis, a comet shone for seven successive days, rising about the eleventh hour  and was believed to be the soul of Caesar, who had been taken to heaven; and this is why a star is set upon the crown of his head in his statue. It was voted that the curia in which he was slain be walled up, that the Ides of March be called the Day of Parricide, and that a meeting of the senate should never be called on that day.
LXXXIX. Hardly any of his assassins survived him for more than three years, or died a natural death. They were all condemned, and they perished in various ways---some by shipwreck, some in battle; some took their own lives with the self-same dagger with which they had impiously slain Caesar."

Sa isang sulyap mo nalaman ang totoo, ang sarap mabuhay punung-puno ng kulay
Sa isang sulyap mo ayos na ako, sa isang sulyap mo, napa-ibig ako
Kim: Bakit kapag kasama kita ang mundo ko'y nag-iiba
Bakit kapag kapiling kita ang puso ko'y sumusigla
Goldmon: Bakit kapag nandito ka problema ko'y nabubura
Ikaw ang aking pag-asa at ang tanging ligaya
(REPEAT CHORUS 2x)
Yuki: sa isang sulyap mo, ayos na ako
Sa isang sulyap mo, napa-ibig ako..."

Pero hindi ko naman maamin na
May gusto ako sayo kinakabahan ako
Hindi ko man lang magawang biglang lumapit sa
Isang katulad mo na para bang prinsesa
Ang pera ko lang ay pambili ng selecta
Sa dami ng manliligaw daig pa sa ginebra
Tapos yung tatay mo tindi pa ng depensa
So pano na yan ano nang gagawin ko
Baka may syota ka na sa susunod na linggo
Naging piti kotse na dumadaan sa inyo
Eh kung ako yun baka sarahan ng pinto
Kaya nag kulong na lang maghapon saaking tahanan
Tatanggalin ko na lahat ng yong mga larawan
Gusto ko ng sumuko taas na ang puting bandila
Kaso pag tanggal ng pako ay mayron akong nakita

Pasulyap sulyap di ko alam kung bakit ba takot mag balak
Dito ko na lang idadaan ang lahat
Alam ko na mali pero mas madali sa sa sa pasulyap sulyap
Pasulyap sulyap di ko alam kung bakit ba takot mag balak
Dito ko na lang idadaan ang lahat
Alam ko na mali pero mas madali sa sa sa pasulyap sulyap
Pawis na pawis na sa kakatayo
Baka makita ako'y nagtago
Palingon lingon kaya hindi maka diretso
Kapag naka lingat sige balik ulit sa pwesto
Eto ba yung tinatawag na pagibig
Pagibig na nakuwa ko lang sa akin pag titig
Di ko sinasadya hindi ko rin pinilit
Okay lang sa akin kahit na maghapon na naka silip
Makita ko lamang siya kahit anong posisyon ay maganda
Kapag ako'y nagsabi at malaman niya
Sa diskarte ko walang aagaw pa at sana nga
Di niya ito mahalata kasi araw araw ko na nga itong ginagawa
Wala akong magagawa kung ako man ay mataya
Ganon na talaga makasalanan ang mata kaya

Pasulyap sulyap di ko alam kung bakit ba takot mag balak
Dito ko na lang idadaan ang lahat
Alam ko na mali pero mas madali sa sa sa pasulyap sulyap
Pasulyap sulyap di ko alam kung bakit ba takot mag balak
Dito ko na lang idadaan ang lahat
Alam ko na mali pero mas madali sa sa sa pasulyap sulyap

Dumaan ang mga araw wala pa rin nagbago
Ayos na to kesa naman biglang maglaho
Nakakapagod din pala yung tago ng tago
Pero sa dami ng nakita ko yon masaya na ako
Ang problema parang may mali
Nung huling tingin ko siya'y naka ngiti
Tapos ako'y biglang hindi mapakale
Binulabog ng pintig na nakaka binge
Ako'y napatabi sa gilid
Simpleng tingin ng tahimik
Bumigat ang hangin ang aking ikanagulat
Nung ika'y lumapit sa akin at ako ay kinausap
Panaginip lamang to maniniwala bako tapos sabi mo sa akin alam mo na ang ginagawa ko
Meron kang binulong naging mulat aking mata pag di ako nakatingin sumusulyap ka rin pala

Pasulyap sulyap di ko alam kung bakit ba takot mag balak
Dito ko na lang idadaan ang lahat
Alam ko na mali pero mas madali sa sa sa pasulyap sulyap
Pasulyap sulyap di ko alam kung bakit ba takot mag balak
Dito ko na lang idadaan ang lahat
Alam ko na mali pero mas madali sa sa sa pasulyap sulyap"

 L. Domitio Ap. Claudio consulibus, discedens ab hibernis Caesar in Italiam, ut quotannis facere consuerat, legatis imperat quos legionibus praefecerat uti quam plurimas possent hieme naves aedificandas veteresque reficiendas curarent. Earum modum formamque demonstrat. Ad celeritatem onerandi subductionesque paulo facit humiliores quam quibus in nostro mari uti consuevimus, atque id eo magis, quod propter crebras commutationes aestuum minus magnos ibi fluctus fieri cognoverat; ad onera, ad multitudinem iumentorum transportandam paulo latiores quam quibus in reliquis utimur maribus. Has omnes actuarias imperat fieri, quam ad rem multum humilitas adiuvat. Ea quae sunt usui ad armandas naves ex Hispania apportari iubet. Ipse conventibus Galliae citerioris peractis in Illyricum proficiscitur, quod a Pirustis finitimam partem provinciae incursionibus vastari audiebat. Eo cum venisset, civitatibus milites imperat certumque in locum convenire iubet. Qua re nuntiata Pirustae legatos ad eum mittunt qui doceant nihil earum rerum publico factum consilio, seseque paratos esse demonstrant omnibus rationibus de iniuriis satisfacere. Accepta oratione eorum Caesar obsides imperat eosque ad certam diem adduci iubet; nisi ita fecerint, sese bello civitatem persecuturum demonstrat. Eis ad diem adductis, ut imperaverat, arbitros inter civitates dat qui litem aestiment poenamque constituant.
 His confectis rebus conventibusque peractis, in citeriorem Galliam revertitur atque inde ad exercitum proficiscitur. Eo cum venisset, circuitis omnibus hibernis, singulari militum studio in summa omnium rerum inopia circiter sescentas eius generis cuius supra demonstravimus naves et longas XXVIII invenit instructas neque multum abesse ab eo quin paucis diebus deduci possint. Collaudatis militibus atque eis qui negotio praefuerant, quid fieri velit ostendit atque omnes ad portum Itium convenire iubet, quo ex portu commodissimum in Britanniam traiectum esse cognoverat, circiter milium passuum XXX transmissum a continenti: huic rei quod satis esse visum est militum reliquit. Ipse cum legionibus expeditis IIII et equitibus DCCC in fines Treverorum proficiscitur, quod hi neque ad concilia veniebant neque imperio parebant Germanosque Transrhenanos sollicitare dicebantur.
 Haec civitas longe plurimum totius Galliae equitatu valet magnasque habet copias peditum Rhenumque, ut supra demonstravimus, tangit. In ea civitate duo de principatu inter se contendebant, Indutiomarus et Cingetorix; e quibus alter, simul atque de Caesaris legionumque adventu cognitum est, ad eum venit, se suosque omnes in officio futuros neque ab amicitia populi Romani defecturos confirmavit quaeque in Treveris gererentur ostendit. At Indutiomarus equitatum peditatumque cogere, eisque qui per aetatem in armis esse non poterant in silvam Arduennam abditis, quae ingenti magnitudine per medios fines Treverorum a flumine Rheno ad initium Remorum pertinet, bellum parare instituit. Sed posteaquam nonnulli principes ex ea civitate et familiaritate Cingetorigis adducti et adventu nostri exercitus perterriti ad Caesarem venerunt et de suis privatim rebus ab eo petere coeperunt, quoniam civitati consulere non possent, veritus ne ab omnibus desereretur Indutiomarus legatos ad Caesarem mittit: sese idcirco ab suis discedere atque ad eum venire noluisse, quo facilius civitatem in officio contineret, ne omnis nobilitatis discessu plebs propter imprudentiam laberetur: itaque esse civitatem in sua potestate, seseque, si Caesar permitteret, ad eum in castra venturum, suas civitatisque fortunas eius fidei permissurum.
 Caesar, etsi intellegebat qua de causa ea dicerentur quaeque eum res ab instituto consilio deterreret, tamen, ne aestatem in Treveris consumere cogeretur omnibus ad Britannicum bellum rebus comparatis, Indutiomarum ad se cum CC obsidibus venire iussit. His adductis, in eis filio propinquisque eius omnibus, quos nominatim evocaverat, consolatus Indutiomarum hortatusque est uti in officio maneret; nihilo tamen setius principibus Treverorum ad se convocatis hos singillatim Cingetorigi conciliavit, quod cum merito eius a se fieri intellegebat, tum magni interesse arbitrabatur eius auctoritatem inter suos quam plurimum valere, cuius tam egregiam in se voluntatem perspexisset. Id tulit factum graviter Indutiomarus, suam gratiam inter suos minui, et, qui iam ante inimico in nos animo fuisset, multo gravius hoc dolore exarsit.
 His rebus constitutis Caesar ad portum Itium cum legionibus pervenit. Ibi cognoscit LX naves, quae in Meldis factae erant, tempestate reiectas cursum tenere non potuisse atque eodem unde erant profectae revertisse; reliquas paratas ad navigandum atque omnibus rebus instructas invenit. Eodem equitatus totius Galliae convenit, numero milium quattuor, principesque ex omnibus civitatibus; ex quibus perpaucos, quorum in se fidem perspexerat, relinquere in Gallia, reliquos obsidum loco secum ducere decreverat, quod, cum ipse abesset, motum Galliae verebatur.
 Erat una cum ceteris Dumnorix Aeduus, de quo ante ab nobis dictum est. Hunc secum habere in primis constituerat, quod eum cupidum rerum novarum, cupidum imperi, magni animi, magnae inter Gallos auctoritatis cognoverat. Accedebat huc quod in concilio Aeduorum Dumnorix dixerat sibi a Caesare regnum civitatis deferri; quod dictum Aedui graviter ferebant, neque recusandi aut deprecandi causa legatos ad Caesarem mittere audebant. Id factum ex suis hospitibus Caesar cognoverat. Ille omnibus primo precibus petere contendit ut in Gallia relinqueretur, partim quod insuetus navigandi mare timeret, partim quod religionibus impediri sese diceret. Posteaquam id obstinate sibi negari vidit, omni spe impetrandi adempta principes Galliae sollicitare, sevocare singulos hortarique coepit uti in continenti remanerent: metu territare: non sine causa fieri, ut Gallia omni nobilitate spoliaretur; id esse consilium Caesaris, ut quos in conspectu Galliae interficere vereretur, hos omnes in Britanniam traductos necaret; fidem reliquis interponere, iusiurandum poscere, ut quod esse ex usu Galliae intellexissent communi consilio administrarent. Haec a compluribus ad Caesarem deferebantur.
 Qua re cognita Caesar, quod tantum civitati Aeduae dignitatis tribuebat, coercendum atque deterrendum quibuscumque rebus posset Dumnorigem statuebat; quod longius eius amentiam progredi videbat, prospiciendum, ne quid sibi ac rei publicae nocere posset. Itaque dies circiter XXV in eo loco commoratus, quod Corus ventus navigationem impediebat, qui magnam partem omnis temporis in his locis flare consuevit, dabat operam ut in officio Dumnorigem contineret, nihilo tamen setius omnia eius consilia cognosceret: tandem idoneam nactus tempestatem milites equitesque conscendere in naves iubet. At omnium impeditis animis Dumnorix cum equitibus Aeduorum a castris insciente Caesare domum discedere coepit. Qua re nuntiata Caesar intermissa profectione atque omnibus rebus postpositis magnam partem equitatus ad eum insequendum mittit retrahique imperat; si vim faciat neque pareat, interfici iubet, nihil hunc se absente pro sano facturum arbitratus, qui praesentis imperium neglexisset. Ille enim revocatus resistere ac se manu defendere suorumque fidem implorare coepit, saepe clamitans liberum se liberaeque esse civitatis. Illi, ut erat imperatum, circumsistunt hominem atque interficiunt: at equites Aedui ad Caesarem omnes revertuntur.
 His rebus gestis, Labieno in continente cum tribus legionibus et equitum milibus duobus relicto ut portus tueretur et rem frumentariam provideret quaeque in Gallia gererentur cognosceret consiliumque pro tempore et pro re caperet, ipse cum quinque legionibus et pari numero equitum, quem in continenti reliquerat, ad solis occasum naves solvit et leni Africo provectus media circiter nocte vento intermisso cursum non tenuit, et longius delatus aestu orta luce sub sinistra Britanniam relictam conspexit. Tum rursus aestus commutationem secutus remis contendit ut eam partem insulae caperet, qua optimum esse egressum superiore aestate cognoverat. Qua in re admodum fuit militum virtus laudanda, qui vectoriis gravibusque navigiis non intermisso remigandi labore longarum navium cursum adaequarunt. Accessum est ad Britanniam omnibus navibus meridiano fere tempore, neque in eo loco hostis est visus; sed, ut postea Caesar ex captivis cognovit, cum magnae manus eo convenissent, multitudine navium perterritae, quae cum annotinis privatisque quas sui quisque commodi fecerat amplius octingentae uno erant visae tempore, a litore discesserant ac se in superiora loca abdiderant.
 Caesar exposito exercitu et loco castris idoneo capto, ubi ex captivis cognovit quo in loco hostium copiae consedissent, cohortibus decem ad mare relictis et equitibus trecentis, qui praesidio navibus essent, de tertia vigilia ad hostes contendit, eo minus veritus navibus, quod in litore molli atque aperto deligatas ad ancoram relinquebat, et praesidio navibus Q. Atrium praefecit. Ipse noctu progressus milia passuum circiter XII hostium copias conspicatus est. Illi equitatu atque essedis ad flumen progressi ex loco superiore nostros prohibere et proelium committere coeperunt. Repulsi ab equitatu se in silvas abdiderunt, locum nacti egregie et natura et opere munitum, quem domestici belli, ut videbantur, causa iam ante praeparaverant: nam crebris arboribus succisis omnes introitus erant praeclusi. Ipsi ex silvis rari propugnabant nostrosque intra munitiones ingredi prohibebant. At milites legionis septimae, testudine facta et aggere ad munitiones adiecto, locum ceperunt eosque ex silvis expulerunt paucis vulneribus acceptis. Sed eos fugientes longius Caesar prosequi vetuit, et quod loci naturam ignorabat, et quod magna parte diei consumpta munitioni castrorum tempus relinqui volebat.
 Postridie eius diei mane tripertito milites equitesque in expeditionem misit, ut eos qui fugerant persequerentur. His aliquantum itineris progressis, cum iam extremi essent in prospectu, equites a Quinto Atrio ad Caesarem venerunt, qui nuntiarent superiore nocte maxima coorta tempestate prope omnes naves adflictas atque in litore eiectas esse, quod neque ancorae funesque subsisterent, neque nautae gubernatoresque vim tempestatis pati possent; itaque ex eo concursu navium magnum esse incommodum acceptum.
 His rebus cognitis Caesar legiones equitatumque revocari atque in itinere resistere iubet, ipse ad naves revertitur; eadem fere quae ex nuntiis litterisque cognoverat coram perspicit, sic ut amissis circiter XL navibus reliquae tamen refici posse magno negotio viderentur. Itaque ex legionibus fabros deligit et ex continenti alios arcessi iubet; Labieno scribit, ut quam plurimas posset eis legionibus, quae sunt apud eum, naves instituat. Ipse, etsi res erat multae operae ac laboris, tamen commodissimum esse statuit omnes naves subduci et cum castris una munitione coniungi. In his rebus circiter dies X consumit ne nocturnis quidem temporibus ad laborem militum intermissis. Subductis navibus castrisque egregie munitis easdem copias, quas ante, praesidio navibus reliquit: ipse eodem unde redierat proficiscitur. Eo cum venisset, maiores iam undique in eum locum copiae Britannorum convenerant summa imperi bellique administrandi communi consilio permissa Cassivellauno, cuius fines a maritimis civitatibus flumen dividit, quod appellatur Tamesis, a mari circiter milia passuum LXXX. Huic superiore tempore cum reliquis civitatibus continentia bella intercesserant; sed nostro adventu permoti Britanni hunc toti bello imperioque praefecerant.
 Britanniae pars interior ab eis incolitur quos natos in insula ipsi memoria proditum dicunt, maritima ab eis, qui praedae ac belli inferendi causa ex Belgio transierunt (qui omnes fere eis nominibus civitatum appellantur, quibus orti ex civitatibus eo pervenerunt) et bello illato ibi permanserunt atque agros colere coeperunt. Hominum est infinita multitudo creberrimaque aedificia fere Gallicis consimilia, pecorum magnus numerus. Utuntur aut aere aut nummo aureo aut taleis ferreis ad certum pondus examinatis pro nummo. Nascitur ibi plumbum album in mediterraneis regionibus, in maritimis ferrum, sed eius exigua est copia; aere utuntur importato. Materia cuiusque generis ut in Gallia est, praeter fagum atque abietem. Leporem et gallinam et anserem gustare fas non putant; haec tamen alunt animi voluptatisque causa. Loca sunt temperatiora quam in Gallia, remissioribus frigoribus.
 Insula natura triquetra, cuius unum latus est contra Galliam. Huius lateris alter angulus, qui est ad Cantium, quo fere omnes ex Gallia naves appelluntur, ad orientem solem, inferior ad meridiem spectat. Hoc pertinet circiter mila passuum quingenta. Alterum vergit ad Hispaniam atque occidentem solem; qua ex parte est Hibernia, dimidio minor, ut aestimatur, quam Britannia, sed pari spatio transmissus atque ex Gallia est in Britanniam. In hoc medio cursu est insula, quae appellatur Mona: complures praeterea minores subiectae insulae existimantur, de quibus insulis nonnulli scripserunt dies continuos triginta sub bruma esse noctem. Nos nihil de eo percontationibus reperiebamus, nisi certis ex aqua mensuris breviores esse quam in continenti noctes videbamus. Huius est longitudo lateris, ut fert illorum opinio, septingentorum milium. Tertium est contra septentriones; cui parti nulla est obiecta terra, sed eius angulus lateris maxime ad Germaniam spectat. Hoc milia passuum octingenta in longitudinem esse existimatur. Ita omnis insula est in circuitu vicies centum milium passuum.
 Ex his omnibus longe sunt humanissimi qui Cantium incolunt, quae regio est maritima omnis, neque multum a Gallica differunt consuetudine. Interiores plerique frumenta non serunt, sed lacte et carne vivunt pellibusque sunt vestiti. Omnes vero se Britanni vitro inficiunt, quod caeruleum efficit colorem, atque hoc horridiores sunt in pugna aspectu; capilloque sunt promisso atque omni parte corporis rasa praeter caput et labrum superius. Uxores habent deni duodenique inter se communes et maxime fratres cum fratribus parentesque cum liberis; sed qui sunt ex his nati, eorum habentur liberi, quo primum virgo quaeque deducta est.
 Equites hostium essedariique acriter proelio cum equitatu nostro in itinere conflixerunt, tamen ut nostri omnibus partibus superiores fuerint atque eos in silvas collesque compulerint; sed compluribus interfectis cupidius insecuti nonnullos ex suis amiserunt. At illi intermisso spatio imprudentibus nostris atque occupatis in munitione castrorum subito se ex statione pro castris collocati, acriter pugnaverunt, duabusque missis subsidio cohortibus a Caesare atque eis primis legionum duarum, cum hae perexiguo intermisso loci spatio inter se constitissent, novo genere pugnae perterritis nostris per medios audacissime perruperunt seque inde incolumes receperunt. Eo die Quintus Laberius Durus, tribunus militum, interficitur. Illi pluribus submissis cohortibus repelluntur.
 Toto hoc in genere pugnae, cum sub oculis omnium ac pro castris dimicaretur, intellectum est nostros propter gravitatem armorum, quod neque insequi cedentes possent neque ab signis discedere auderent, minus aptos esse ad huius generis hostem, equites autem magno cum periculo proelio dimicare, propterea quod illi etiam consulto plerumque cederent et, cum paulum ab legionibus nostros removissent, ex essedis desilirent et pedibus dispari proelio contenderent. Equestris autem proeli ratio et cedentibus et insequentibus par atque idem periculum inferebat. Accedebat huc ut numquam conferti sed rari magnisque intervallis proeliarentur stationesque dispositas haberent, atque alios alii deinceps exciperent, integrique et recentes defetigatis succederent.
 Postero die procul a castris hostes in collibus constiterunt rarique se ostendere et lenius quam pridie nostros equites proelio lacessere coeperunt. Sed meridie, cum Caesar pabulandi causa tres legiones atque omnem equitatum cum Gaio Trebonio legato misisset, repente ex omnibus partibus ad pabulatores advolaverunt, sic uti ab signis legionibusque non absisterent. Nostri acriter in eos impetu facto reppulerunt neque finem sequendi fecerunt, quoad subsidio confisi equites, cum post se legiones viderent, praecipites hostes egerunt magnoque eorum numero interfecto neque sui colligendi neque consistendi aut ex essedis desiliendi facultatem dederunt. Ex hac fuga protinus, quae undique convenerant, auxilia discesserunt, neque post id tempus umquam summis nobiscum copiis hostes contenderunt.
 Caesar cognito consilio eorum ad flumen Tamesim in fines Cassivellauni exercitum duxit; quod flumen uno omnino loco pedibus, atque hoc aegre, transiri potest. Eo cum venisset, animum advertit ad alteram fluminis ripam magnas esse copias hostium instructas. Ripa autem erat acutis sudibus praefixis munita, eiusdemque generis sub aqua defixae sudes flumine tegebantur. His rebus cognitis a captivis perfugisque Caesar praemisso equitatu confestim legiones subsequi iussit. Sed ea celeritate atque eo impetu milites ierunt, cum capite solo ex aqua exstarent, ut hostes impetum legionum atque equitum sustinere non possent ripasque dimitterent ac se fugae mandarent.
 Cassivellaunus, ut supra demonstravimus, omni deposita spe contentionis dimissis amplioribus copiis milibus circiter quattuor essedariorum relictis itinera nostra servabat paulumque ex via excedebat locisque impeditis ac silvestribus sese occultabat, atque eis regionibus quibus nos iter facturos cognoverat pecora atque homines ex agris in silvas compellebat et, cum equitatus noster liberius praedandi vastandique causa se in agros eiecerat, omnibus viis semitisque essedarios ex silvis emittebat et magno cum periculo nostrorum equitum cum eis confligebat atque hoc metu latius vagari prohibebat. Relinquebatur ut neque longius ab agmine legionum discedi Caesar pateretur, et tantum in agris vastandis incendiisque faciendis hostibus noceretur, quantum labore atque itinere legionarii milites efficere poterant.
 Interim Trinobantes, prope firmissima earum regionum civitas, ex qua Mandubracius adulescens Caesaris fidem secutus ad eum in continentem Galliam venerat, cuius pater in ea civitate regnum obtinuerat interfectusque erat a Cassivellauno, ipse fuga mortem vitaverat, legatos ad Caesarem mittunt pollicenturque sese ei dedituros atque imperata facturos; petunt, ut Mandubracium ab iniuria Cassivellauni defendat atque in civitatem mittat, qui praesit imperiumque obtineat. His Caesar imperat obsides quadraginta frumentumque exercitui Mandubraciumque ad eos mittit. Illi imperata celeriter fecerunt, obsides ad numerum frumentumque miserunt.
 Trinobantibus defensis atque ab omni militum inuria prohibitis Cenimagni, Segontiaci, Ancalites, Bibroci, Cassi legationibus missis sese Caesari dedunt. Ab his cognoscit non longe ex eo loco oppidum Cassivellauni abesse silvis paludibusque munitum, quo satis magnus hominum pecorisque numerus invenerit. Oppidum autem Britanni vocant, cum silvas impeditas vallo atque fossa munierunt, quo incursionis hostium vitandae causa convenire consuerunt. Eo proficiscitur cum legionibus: locum reperit egregie natura atque opere munitum; tamen hunc duabus ex partibus oppugnare contendit. Hostes paulisper morati militum nostrorum impetum non tulerunt seseque alia ex parte oppidi eiecerunt. Magnus ibi numerus pecoris repertus, multique in fuga sunt comprehensi atque interfecti.
 Dum haec in his locis geruntur, Cassivellaunus ad Cantium, quod esse ad mare supra demonstravimus, quibus regionibus quattuor reges praeerant, Cingetorix, Carvilius, Taximagulus, Segovax, nuntios mittit atque eis imperat uti coactis omnibus copiis castra navalia de improviso adoriantur atque oppugent. Ei cum ad castra venissent, nostri eruptione facta multis eorum interfectis, capto etiam nobili duce Lugotorige suos incolumes reduxerunt. Cassivellaunus hoc proelio nuntiato tot detrimentis acceptis, vastatis finibus, maxime etiam permotus defectione civitatum legatos per Atrebatem Commium de deditione ad Caesarem mittit. Caesar, cum constituisset hiemare in continenti propter repentinos Galliae motus, neque multum aestatis superesset, atque id facile extrahi posse intellegeret, obsides imperat et quid in annos singulos vectigalis populo Romano Britannia penderet constituit; interdicit atque imperat Cassivellauno, ne Mandubracio neu Trinobantibus noceat.
 Obsidibus acceptis exercitum reducit ad mare, naves invenit refectas. His deductis, quod et captivorum magnum numerum habebat, et nonnullae tempestate deperierant naves, duobus commeatibus exercitum reportare instituit. Ac sic accidit, uti ex tanto navium numero tot navigationibus neque hoc neque superiore anno ulla omnino navis, quae milites portaret, desideraretur; at ex eis, quae inanes ex continenti ad eum remitterentur et prioris commeatus expositis militibus et quas postea Labienus faciendas curaverat numero LX, perpaucae locum caperent, reliquae fere omnes reicerentur. Quas cum aliquamdiu Caesar frustra exspectasset, ne anni tempore a navigatione excluderetur, quod aequinoctium suberat, necessario angustius milites collocavit ac summa tranquillitate consecuta, secunda inita cum solvisset vigilia, prima luce terram attigit omnesque incolumes naves perduxit.
 Subductis navibus concilioque Gallorum Samarobrivae peracto, quod eo anno frumentum in Gallia propter siccitates angustius provenerat, coactus est aliter ac superioribus annis exercitum in hibernis collocare legionesque in plures civitates distribuere. Ex quibus unam in Morinos ducendam Gaio Fabio legato dedit, alteram in Nervios Quinto Ciceroni, tertiam in Esubios Lucio Roscio; quartam in Remis cum Tito Labieno in confinio Treverorum hiemare iussit. Tres in Belgis collocavit: eis Marcum Crassum quaestorem et Lucium Munatium Plancum et Gaium Trebonium legatos praefecit. Unam legionem, quam proxime trans Padum conscripserat, et cohortes V in Eburones, quorum pars maxima est inter Mosam ac Rhenum, qui sub imperio Ambiorigis et Catuvolci erant, misit. Eis militibus Quintum Titurium Sabinum et Lucium Aurunculeium Cottam legatos praeesse iussit. Ad hunc modum distributis legionibus facillime inopiae frumentariae sese mederi posse existimavit. Atque harum tamen omnium legionum hiberna praeter eam, quam Lucio Roscio in pacatissimam et quietissimam partem ducendam dederat, milibus passuum centum continebantur. Ipse interea, quoad legiones collocatas munitaque hiberna cognovisset, in Gallia morari constituit.
 Erat in Carnutibus summo loco natus Tasgetius, cuius maiores in sua civitate regnum obtinuerant. Huic Caesar pro eius virtute atque in se benevolentia, quod in omnibus bellis singulari eius opera fuerat usus, maiorum locum restituerat. Tertium iam hunc annum regnantem inimici, multis palam ex civitate eius auctoribus, eum interfecerunt. Defertur ea res ad Caesarem. Ille veritus, quod ad plures pertinebat, ne civitas eorum impulsu deficeret, Lucium Plancum cum legione ex Belgio celeriter in Carnutes proficisci iubet ibique hiemare quorumque opera cognoverat Tasgetium interfectum, hos comprehensos ad se mittere. Interim ab omnibus legatis quaestoreque, quibus legiones tradiderat, certior factus est in hiberna perventum locumque hibernis esse munitum.
 Diebus circiter XV, quibus in hiberna ventum est, initium repentini tumultus ac defectionis ortum est ab Ambiorige et Catuvolco; qui, cum ad fines regni sui Sabino Cottaeque praesto fuissent frumentumque in hiberna comportavissent, Indutiomari Treveri nuntiis impulsi suos concitaverunt subitoque oppressis lignatoribus magna manu ad castra oppugnatum venerunt. Cum celeriter nostri arma cepissent vallumque adscendissent atque una ex parte Hispanis equitibus emissis equestri proelio superiores fuissent, desperata re hostes suos ab oppugnatione reduxerunt. Tum suo more conclamaverunt, uti aliqui ex nostris ad colloquium prodiret: habere sese, quae de re communi dicere vellent, quibus rebus controversias minui posse sperarent.
 Mittitur ad eos colloquendi causa Gaius Arpineius, eques Romanus, familiaris Quinti Tituri, et Quintus Iunius ex Hispania quidam, qui iam ante missu Caesaris ad Ambiorigem ventitare consuerat; apud quos Ambiorix ad hunc modum locutus est: Sese pro Caesaris in se beneficiis plurimum ei confiteri debere, quod eius opera stipendio liberatus esset, quod Aduatucis, finitimis suis, pendere consuesset, quodque ei et filius et fratris filius ab Caesare remissi essent, quos Aduatuci obsidum numero missos apud in servitute et catenis tenuissent; neque id, quod fecerit de oppugnatione castrorum, aut iudicio aut voluntate sua fecisse, sed coactu civitatis, suaque esse eiusmodi imperia, ut non minus haberet iuris in se multitudo quam ipse in multitudinem. Civitati porro hanc fuisse belli causam, quod repentinae Gallorum coniurationi resistere non potuerit. Id se facile ex humilitate sua probare posse, quod non adeo sit imperitus rerum ut suis copiis populum Romanum superari posse confidat. Sed esse Galliae commune consilium: omnibus hibernis Caesaris oppugnandis hunc esse dictum diem, ne qua legio alterae legioni subsidio venire posset. Non facile Gallos Gallis negare potuisse, praesertim cum de recuperanda communi libertate consilium initum videretur. Quibus quoniam pro pietate satisfecerit, habere nunc se rationem offici pro beneficiis Caesaris: monere, orare Titurium pro hospitio, ut suae ac militum saluti consulat. Magnam manum Germanorum conductam Rhenum transisse; hanc adfore biduo. Ipsorum esse consilium, velintne priusquam finitimi sentiant eductos ex hibernis milites aut ad Ciceronem aut ad Labienum deducere, quorum alter milia passuum circiter quinquaginta, alter paulo amplius ab eis absit. Illud se polliceri et iureiurando confirmare tutum iter per fines daturum. Quod cum faciat, et civitati sese consulere, quod hibernis levetur, et Caesari pro eius meritis gratiam referre. Hac oratione habita discedit Ambiorix.
 Arpineius et Iunius, quae audierunt, ad legatos deferunt. Illi repentina re perturbati, etsi ab hoste ea dicebantur, tamen non neglegenda existimabant maximeque hac re permovebantur, quod civitatem ignobilem atque humilem Eburonum sua sponte populo Romano bellum facere ausam vix erat credendum. Itaque ad consilium rem deferunt magnaque inter eos exsistit controversia. Lucius Aurunculeius compluresque tribuni militum et primorum ordinum centuriones nihil temere agendum neque ex hibernis iniussu Caesaris discedendum existimabant: quantasvis  copias etiam Germanorum sustineri posse munitis hibernis docebant: rem esse testimonio, quod primum hostium impetum multis ultro vulneribus illatis fortissime sustinuerint: re frumentaria non premi; interea et ex proximis hibernis et a Caesare conventura subsidia: postremo quid esse levius aut turpius, quam auctore hoste de summis rebus capere consilium?
 Contra ea Titurius sero facturos clamitabat, cum maiores manus hostium adiunctis Germanis convenissent aut cum aliquid calamitatis in proximis hibernis esset acceptum. Brevem consulendi esse occasionem. Caesarem arbitrari profectum in Italiam; neque aliter Carnutes interficiendi Tasgeti consilium fuisse capturos, neque Eburones, si ille adesset, tanta contemptione nostri ad castra venturos esse. Non hostem auctorem, sed rem spectare: subesse Rhenum; magno esse Germanis dolori Ariovisti mortem et superiores nostras victorias; ardere Galliam tot contumeliis acceptis sub populi Romani imperium redactam superiore gloria rei militaris exstincta. Postremo quis hoc sibi persuaderet, sine certa re Ambiorigem ad eiusmodi consilium descendisse? Suam sententiam in utramque partem esse tutam: si nihil esset durius, nullo cum periculo ad proximam legionem perventuros; si Gallia omnis cum Germanis consentiret, unam esse in celeritate positam salutem. Cottae quidem atque eorum, qui dissentirent, consilium quem habere exitum? In quo si non praesens periculum, at certe longinqua obsidione fames esset timenda.
 Hac in utramque partem disputatione habita, cum a Cotta primisque ordinibus acriter resisteretur, ""Vincite,"" inquit, ""si ita vultis,"" Sabinus, et id clariore voce, ut magna pars militum exaudiret; ""neque is sum,"" inquit, ""qui gravissime ex vobis mortis periculo terrear: hi sapient; si gravius quid acciderit, abs te rationem reposcent, qui, si per te liceat, perendino die cum proximis hibernis coniuncti communem cum reliquis belli casum sustineant, non reiecti et relegati longe ab ceteris aut ferro aut fame intereant.""
 Consurgitur ex consilio; comprehendunt utrumque et orant, ne sua dissensione et pertinacia rem in summum periculum deducat: facilem esse rem, seu maneant, seu proficiscantur, si modo unum omnes sentiant ac probent; contra in dissensione nullam se salutem perspicere. Res disputatione ad mediam noctem perducitur. Tandem dat Cotta permotus manus: superat sententia Sabini. Pronuntiatur prima luce ituros. Consumitur vigiliis reliqua pars noctis, cum sua quisque miles circumspiceret, quid secum portare posset, quid ex instrumento hibernorum relinquere cogeretur. Omnia excogitantur, quare nec sine periculo maneatur, et languore militum et vigiliis periculum augeatur. Prima luce sic ex castris proficiscuntur, ut quibus esset persuasum non ab hoste, sed ab homine amicissimo Ambiorige consilium datum, longissimo agmine maximisque impedimentis.
 At hostes, posteaquam ex nocturno fremitu vigiliisque de profectione eorum senserunt, collocatis insidiis bipertito in silvis opportuno atque occulto loco a milibus passuum circiter duobus Romanorum adventum exspectabant, et cum se maior pars agminis in magnam convallem demisisset, ex utraque parte eius vallis subito se ostenderunt novissimosque premere et primos prohibere ascensu atque iniquissimo nostris loco proelium committere coeperunt.
 Tum demum Titurius, qui nihil ante providisset, trepidare et concursare cohortesque disponere, haec tamen ipsa timide atque ut eum omnia deficere viderentur; quod plerumque eis accidere consuevit, qui in ipso negotio consilium capere coguntur. At Cotta, qui cogitasset haec posse in itinere accidere atque ob eam causam profectionis auctor non fuisset, nulla in re communi saluti deerat et in appellandis cohortandisque militibus imperatoris et in pugna militis officia praestabat. Cum propter longitudinem agminis minus facile omnia per se obire et, quid quoque loco faciendum esset, providere possent, iusserunt pronuntiare, ut impedimenta relinquerent atque in orbem consisterent. Quod consilium etsi in eiusmodi casu reprehendendum non est, tamen incommode accidit: nam et nostris militibus spem minuit et hostes ad pugnam alacriores effecit, quod non sine summo timore et desperatione id factum videbatur. Praeterea accidit, quod fieri necesse erat, ut vulgo milites ab signis discederent, quae quisque eorum carissima haberet, ab impedimentis petere atque arripere properaret, clamore et fletu omnia complerentur.
 At barbaris consilium non defuit. Nam duces eorum tota acie pronuntiare iusserunt, ne quis ab loco discederet: illorum esse praedam atque illis reservari quaecumque Romani reliquissent: proinde omnia in victoria posita existimarent. Erant et virtute et studio pugnandi pares; nostri, tametsi ab duce et a fortuna deserebantur, tamen omnem spem salutis in virtute ponebant, et quotiens quaeque cohors procurrerat, ab ea parte magnus numerus hostium cadebat. Qua re animadversa Ambiorix pronuntiari iubet, ut procul tela coniciant neu propius accedant et, quam in partem Romani impetum fecerint, cedant (levitate armorum et cotidiana exercitatione nihil eis noceri posse), rursus se ad signa recipientes insequantur.
 Quo praecepto ab eis diligentissime observato, cum quaepiam cohors ex orbe excesserat atque impetum fecerat, hostes velocissime refugiebant. Interim eam partem nudari necesse erat et ab latere aperto tela recipi. Rursus cum in eum locum unde erant egressi reverti coeperant, et ab eis qui cesserant et ab eis qui proximi steterant circumveniebantur; sin autem locum tenere vellent, nec virtuti locus relinquebatur, neque ab tanta multitudine coniecta tela conferti vitare poterant. Tamen tot incommodis conflictati, multis vulneribus acceptis resistebant et magna parte diei consumpta, cum a prima luce ad horam octavam pugnaretur, nihil quod ipsis esset indignum committebant. Tum Tito Balventio, qui superiore anno primum pilum duxerat, viro forti et magnae auctoritatis, utrumque femur tragula traicitur; Quintus Lucanius, eiusdem ordinis, fortissime pugnans, dum circumvento filio subvenit, interficitur; Lucius Cotta legatus omnes cohortes ordinesque adhortans in adversum os funda vulneratur.
 His rebus permotus Quintus Titurius, cum procul Ambiorigem suos cohortantem conspexisset, interpretem suum Gnaeum Pompeium ad eum mittit rogatum ut sibi militibusque parcat. Ille appellatus respondit: si velit secum colloqui, licere; sperare a multitudine impetrari posse, quod ad militum salutem pertineat; ipsi vero nihil nocitum iri, inque eam rem se suam fidem interponere. Ille cum Cotta saucio communicat, si videatur, pugna ut excedant et cum Ambiorige una colloquantur: sperare ab eo de sua ac militum salute impetrari posse. Cotta se ad armatum hostem iturum negat atque in eo perseverat.
 Sabinus quos in praesentia tribunos militum circum se habebat et primorum ordinum centuriones se sequi iubet et, cum propius Ambiorigem accessisset, iussus arma abicere imperatum facit suisque ut idem faciant imperat. Interim, dum de condicionibus inter se agunt longiorque consulto ab Ambiorige instituitur sermo, paulatim circumventus interficitur. Tum vero suo more victoriam conclamant atque ululatum tollunt impetuque in nostros facto ordines perturbant. Ibi Lucius Cotta pugnans interficitur cum maxima parte militum. Reliqui se in castra recipiunt unde erant egressi. Ex quibus Lucius Petrosidius aquilifer, cum magna multitudine hostium premeretur, aquilam intra vallum proiecit; ipse pro castris fortissime pugnans occiditur. Illi aegre ad noctem oppugnationem sustinent; noctu ad unum omnes desperata salute se ipsi interficiunt. Pauci ex proelio lapsi incertis itineribus per silvas ad Titum Labienum legatum in hiberna perveniunt atque eum de rebus gestis certiorem faciunt.
 Hac victoria sublatus Ambiorix statim cum equitatu in Aduatucos, qui erant eius regno finitimi, proficiscitur; neque noctem neque diem intermittit peditatumque subsequi iubet. Re demonstrata Aduatucisque concitatis postero die in Nervios pervenit hortaturque, ne sui in perpetuum liberandi atque ulciscendi Romanos pro eis quas acceperint iniuriis occasionem dimittant: interfectos esse legatos duos magnamque partem exercitus interisse demonstrat; nihil esse negoti subito oppressam legionem quae cum Cicerone hiemet interfici; se ad eam rem profitetur adiutorem. Facile hac oratione Nerviis persuadet.
 Itaque confestim dimissis nuntiis ad Ceutrones, Grudios, Levacos, Pleumoxios, Geidumnos, qui omnes sub eorum imperio sunt, quam maximas manus possunt cogunt et de improviso ad Ciceronis hiberna advolant nondum ad eum fama de Tituri morte perlata. Huic quoque accidit, quod fuit necesse, ut nonnulli milites, qui lignationis munitionisque causa in silvas discessissent, repentino equitum adventu interciperentur. His circumventis magna manu Eburones, Nervii, Aduatuci atque horum omnium socii et clientes legionem oppugnare incipiunt. Nostri celeriter ad arma concurrunt, vallum conscendunt. Aegre is dies sustentatur, quod omnem spem hostes in celeritate ponebant atque hanc adepti victoriam in perpetuum se fore victores confidebant.
 Mittuntur ad Caesarem confestim ab Cicerone litterae magnis propositis praemiis, si pertulissent: obsessis omnibus viis missi intercipiuntur. Noctu ex materia, quam munitionis causa comportaverant, turres admodum CXX excitantur incredibili celeritate; quae deesse operi videbantur, perficiuntur. Hostes postero die multo maioribus coactis copiis castra oppugnant, fossam complent. Eadem ratione, qua pridie, ab nostris resistitur. Hoc idem reliquis deinceps fit diebus. Nulla pars nocturni temporis ad laborem intermittitur; non aegris, non vulneratis facultas quietis datur. Quaecumque ad proximi diei oppugnationem opus sunt noctu comparantur; multae praeustae sudes, magnus muralium pilorum numerus instituitur; turres contabulantur, pinnae loricaeque ex cratibus attexuntur. Ipse Cicero, cum tenuissima valetudine esset, ne nocturnum quidem sibi tempus ad quietem relinquebat, ut ultro militum concursu ac vocibus sibi parcere cogeretur.
 Tunc duces principesque Nerviorum qui aliquem sermonis aditum causamque amicitiae cum Cicerone habebant colloqui sese velle dicunt. Facta potestate eadem quae Ambiorix cum Titurio egerat commemorant: omnem esse in armis Galliam; Germanos Rhenum transisse; Caesaris reliquorumque hiberna oppugnari. Addunt etiam de Sabini morte: Ambiorigem ostentant fidei faciendae causa. Errare eos dicunt, si quidquam ab his praesidi sperent, qui suis rebus diffidant; sese tamen hoc esse in Ciceronem populumque Romanum animo, ut nihil nisi hiberna recusent atque hanc inveterascere consuetudinem nolint: licere illis incolumibus per se ex hibernis discedere et quascumque in partes velint sine metu proficisci. Cicero ad haec unum modo respondit: non esse consuetudinem populi Romani accipere ab hoste armato condicionem: si ab armis discedere velint, se adiutore utantur legatosque ad Caesarem mittant; sperare pro eius iustitia, quae petierint, impetraturos.
 Ab hac spe repulsi Nervii vallo pedum IX et fossa pedum XV hiberna cingunt. Haec et superiorum annorum consuetudine ab nobis cognoverant et, quos clam de exercitu habebant captivos, ab eis docebantur; sed nulla ferramentorum copia quae esset ad hunc usum idonea, gladiis caespites circumcidere, manibus sagulisque terram exhaurire nitebantur. Qua quidem ex re hominum multitudo cognosci potuit: nam minus horis tribus milium pedum XV in circuitu munitionem perfecerunt reliquisque diebus turres ad altitudinem valli, falces testudinesque, quas idem captivi docuerant, parare ac facere coeperunt.
 Septimo oppugnationis die maximo coorto vento ferventes fusili ex argilla glandes fundis et fervefacta iacula in casas, quae more Gallico stramentis erant tectae, iacere coeperunt. Hae celeriter ignem comprehenderunt et venti magnitudine in omnem locum castrorum distulerunt. Hostes maximo clamore sicuti parta iam atque explorata victoria turres testudinesque agere et scalis vallum ascendere coeperunt. At tanta militum virtus atque ea praesentia animi fuit, ut, cum undique flamma torrerentur maximaque telorum multitudine premerentur suaque omnia impedimenta atque omnes fortunas conflagrare intellegerent, non modo demigrandi causa de vallo decederet nemo, sed paene ne respiceret quidem quisquam, ac tum omnes acerrime fortissimeque pugnarent. Hic dies nostris longe gravissimus fuit; sed tamen hunc habuit eventum, ut eo die maximus numerus hostium vulneraretur atque interficeretur, ut se sub ipso vallo constipaverant recessumque primis ultimi non dabant. Paulum quidem intermissa flamma et quodam loco turri adacta et contingente vallum tertiae cohortis centuriones ex eo, quo stabant, loco recesserunt suosque omnes removerunt, nutu vocibusque hostes, si introire vellent, vocare coeperunt; quorum progredi ausus est nemo. Tum ex omni parte lapidibus coniectis deturbati, turrisque succensa est.
 Erant in ea legione fortissimi viri, centuriones, qui primis ordinibus appropinquarent, Titus Pullo et Lucius Vorenus. Hi perpetuas inter se controversias habebant, quinam anteferretur, omnibusque annis de locis summis simultatibus contendebant. Ex his Pullo, cum acerrime ad munitiones pugnaretur, ""Quid dubitas,"" inquit, "" Vorene? aut quem locum tuae probandae virtutis exspectas ? hic dies de nostris controversiis iudicabit."" Haec cum dixisset, procedit extra munitiones quaque pars hostium confertissima est visa irrumpit. Ne Vorenus quidem tum sese vallo continet, sed omnium veritus existimationem subsequitur. Mediocri spatio relicto Pullo pilum in hostes immittit atque unum ex multitudine procurrentem traicit; quo percusso et exanimato hunc scutis protegunt, in hostem tela universi coniciunt neque dant regrediendi facultatem. Transfigitur scutum Pulloni et verutum in balteo defigitur. Avertit hic casus vaginam et gladium educere conanti dextram moratur manum, impeditumque hostes circumsistunt. Succurrit inimicus illi Vorenus et laboranti subvenit. Ad hunc se confestim a Pullone omnis multitudo convertit: illum veruto arbitrantur occisum. Gladio comminus rem gerit Vorenus atque uno interfecto reliquos paulum propellit; dum cupidius instat, in locum deiectus inferiorem concidit. Huic rursus circumvento fert subsidium Pullo, atque ambo incolumes compluribus interfectis summa cum laude sese intra munitiones recipiunt. Sic fortuna in contentione et certamine utrumque versavit, ut alter alteri inimicus auxilio salutique esset, neque diiudicari posset, uter utri virtute anteferendus videretur.
 Quanto erat in dies gravior atque asperior oppugnatio, et maxime quod magna parte militum confecta vulneribus res ad paucitatem defensorum pervenerat, tanto crebriores litterae nuntiique ad Caesarem mittebantur; quorum pars deprehensa in conspectu nostrorum militum cum cruciatu necabatur. Erat unus intus Nervius nomine Vertico, loco natus honesto, qui a prima obsidione ad Ciceronem perfugerat suamque ei fidem praestiterat. Hic servo spe libertatis magnisque persuadet praemiis, ut litteras ad Caesarem deferat. Has ille in iaculo illigatas effert et Gallus inter Gallos sine ulla suspicione versatus ad Caesarem pervenit. Ab eo de periculis Ciceronis legionisque cognoscitur.
 Caesar acceptis litteris hora circiter XI diei statim nuntium in Bellovacos ad M. Crassum quaestorem mittit, cuius hiberna aberant ab eo milia passuum XXV; iubet media nocte legionem proficisci celeriterque ad se venire. Exit cum nuntio Crassus. Alterum ad Gaium Fabium legatum mittit, ut in Atrebatium fines legionem adducat, qua sibi iter faciendum sciebat. Scribit Labieno, si rei publicae commodo facere posset, cum legione ad fines Nerviorum veniat. Reliquam partem exercitus, quod paulo aberat longius, non putat exspectandam; equites circiter quadringentos ex proximis hibernis colligit.
 Hora circiter tertia ab antecursoribus de Crassi adventu certior factus eo die milia passuum XX procedit. Crassum Samarobrivae praeficit legionemque attribuit, quod ibi impedimenta exercitus, obsides civitatum, litteras publicas frumentumque omne quod eo tolerandae hiemis causa devexerat relinquebat. Fabius, ut imperatum erat, non ita multum moratus in itinere cum legione occurrit. Labienus interitu Sabini et caede cohortium cognita, cum omnes ad eum Treverorum copiae venissent, veritus, si ex hibernis fugae similem profectionem fecisset, ut hostium impetum sustinere posset, praesertim quos recenti victoria efferri sciret, litteras Caesari remittit, quanto cum periculo legionem ex hibernis educturus esset; rem gestam in Eburonibus perscribit; docet omnes equitatus peditatusque copias Treverorum tria milia passuum longe ab suis castris consedisse.
 Caesar consilio eius probato, etsi opinione trium legionum deiectus ad duas redierat, tamen unum communis salutis auxilium in celeritate ponebat. Venit magnis itineribus in Nerviorum fines. Ibi ex captivis cognoscit, quae apud Ciceronem gerantur, quantoque in periculo res sit. Tum cuidam ex equitibus Gallis magnis praemiis persuadet uti ad Ciceronem epistolam deferat. Hanc Graecis conscriptam litteris mittit, ne intercepta epistola nostra ab hostibus consilia cognoscantur. Si adire non possit, monet ut tragulam cum epistola ad amentum deligata intra munitionem castrorum abiciat. In litteris scribit se cum legionibus profectum celeriter adfore; hortatur ut pristinam virtutem retineat. Gallus periculum veritus, ut erat praeceptum, tragulam mittit. Haec casu ad turrim adhaesit neque ab nostris biduo animadversa tertio die a quodam milite conspicitur, dempta ad Ciceronem defertur. Ille perlectam in conventu militum recitat maximaque omnes laetitia adficit. Tum fumi incendiorum procul videbantur; quae res omnem dubitationem adventus legionum expulit.
 Galli re cognita per exploratores obsidionem relinquunt, ad Caesarem omnibus copiis contendunt. Hae erant armata circiter milia LX. Cicero data facultate Gallum ab eodem Verticone, quem supra demonstravimus, repetit, qui litteras ad Caesarem deferat; hunc admonet, iter caute diligenterque faciat: perscribit in litteris hostes ab se discessisse omnemque ad eum multitudinem convertisse. Quibus litteris circiter media nocte Caesar adlatis suos facit certiores eosque ad dimicandum animo confirmat. Postero die luce prima movet castra et circiter milia passuum quattuor progressus trans vallem et rivum multitudinem hostium conspicatur. Erat magni periculi res tantulis copiis iniquo loco dimicare; tum, quoniam obsidione liberatum Ciceronem sciebat, aequo animo remittendum de celeritate existimabat: consedit et quam aequissimo loco potest castra communit atque haec, etsi erant exigua per se vix hominum milium septem praesertim nullis cum impedimentis, tamen angustiis viarum quam maxime potest contrahit, eo consilio, ut in summam contemptionem hostibus veniat. Interim speculatoribus in omnes partes dimissis explorat quo commodissime itinere vallem transire possit.
 Eo die parvulis equestribus proeliis ad aquam factis utrique sese suo loco continent: Galli, quod ampliores copias, quae nondum convenerant, exspectabant; Caesar, si forte timoris simulatione hostes in suum locum elicere posset, ut citra vallem pro castris proelio contenderet, si id efficere non posset, ut exploratis itineribus minore cum periculo vallem rivumque transiret. Prima luce hostium equitatus ad castra accedit proeliumque cum nostris equitibus committit. Caesar consulto equites cedere seque in castra recipere iubet, simul ex omnibus partibus castra altiore vallo muniri portasque obstrui atque in his administrandis rebus quam maxime concursari et cum simulatione agi timoris iubet.
 Quibus omnibus rebus hostes invitati copias traducunt aciemque iniquo loco constituunt, nostris vero etiam de vallo deductis propius accedunt et tela intra munitionem ex omnibus partibus coniciunt praeconibusque circummissis pronuntiari iubent, seu quis Gallus seu Romanus velit ante horam tertiam ad se transire, sine periculo licere; post id tempus non fore potestatem: ac sic nostros contempserunt, ut obstructis in speciem portis singulis ordinibus caespitum, quod ea non posse introrumpere videbantur, alii vallum manu scindere, alii fossas complere inciperent. Tum Caesar omnibus portis eruptione facta equitatuque emisso celeriter hostes in fugam dat, sic uti omnino pugnandi causa resisteret nemo, magnumque ex eis numerum occidit atque omnes armis exuit.
 Longius prosequi veritus, quod silvae paludesque intercedebant neque etiam parvulo detrimento illorum locum relinqui videbat, omnibus suis incolumibus copiis eodem die ad Ciceronem pervenit. Institutas turres, testudines munitionesque hostium admiratur; legione producta cognoscit non decimum quemque esse reliquum militem sine vulnere: ex his omnibus iudicat rebus, quanto cum periculo et quanta cum virtute res sint administratae. Ciceronem pro eius merito legionemque collaudat; centuriones singillatim tribunosque militum appellat, quorum egregiam fuisse virtutem testimonio Ciceronis cognoverat. De casu Sabini et Cottae certius ex captivis cognoscit. Postero die contione habita rem gestam proponit, milites consolatur et confirmat: quod detrimentum culpa et temeritate legati sit acceptum, hoc aequiore animo ferendum docet, quod beneficio deorum immortalium et virtute eorum expiato incommodo neque hostibus diutina laetatio neque ipsis longior dolor relinquatur.
 Interim ad Labienum per Remos incredibili celeritate de victoria Caesaris fama perfertur, ut, cum ab hibernis Ciceronis milia passuum abesset circiter LX, eoque post horam nonam diei Caesar pervenisset, ante mediam noctem ad portas castrorum clamor oreretur, quo clamore significatio victoriae gratulatioque ab Remis Labieno fieret. Hac fama ad Treveros perlata Indutiomarus, qui postero die castra Labieni oppugnare decreverat, noctu profugit copiasque omnes in Treveros reducit. Caesar Fabium cum sua legione remittit in hiberna, ipse cum tribus legionibus circum Samarobrivam trinis hibernis hiemare constituit et, quod tanti motus Galliae exstiterant, totam hiemem ipse ad exercitum manere decrevit. Nam illo incommodo de Sabini morte perlato omnes fere Galliae civitates de bello consultabant, nuntios legationesque in omnes partes dimittebant et quid reliqui consili caperent atque unde initium belli fieret explorabant nocturnaque in locis desertis concilia habebant. Neque ullum fere totius hiemis tempus sine sollicitudine Caesaris intercessit, quin aliquem de consiliis ac motu Gallorum nuntium acciperet. In his ab Lucio Roscio, quem legioni tertiae decimae praefecerat, certior factus est magnas Gallorum copias earum civitatum, quae Armoricae appellantur, oppugnandi sui causa convenisse neque longius milia passuum octo ab hibernis suis afuisse, sed nuntio allato de victoria Caesaris discessisse, adeo ut fugae similis discessus videretur.
 At Caesar principibus cuiusque civitatis ad se evocatis alias territando, cum se scire quae fierent denuntiaret, alias cohortando magnam partem Galliae in officio tenuit. Tamen Senones, quae est civitas in primis firma et magnae inter Gallos auctoritatis, Cavarinum, quem Caesar apud eos regem constituerat, cuius frater Moritasgus adventu in Galliam Caesaris cuiusque maiores regnum obtinuerant, interficere publico consilio conati, cum ille praesensisset ac profugisset, usque ad fines insecuti regno domoque expulerunt et, missis ad Caesarem satisfaciendi causa legatis, cum is omnem ad se senatum venire iussisset, dicto audientes non fuerunt. Tantum apud homines barbaros valuit esse aliquos repertos principes inferendi belli tantamque omnibus voluntatum commutationem attulit, ut praeter Aeduos et Remos, quos praecipuo semper honore Caesar habuit, alteros pro vetere ac perpetua erga populum Romanum fide, alteros pro recentibus Gallici belli officiis, nulla fere civitas fuerit non suspecta nobis. Idque adeo haud scio mirandumne sit, cum compluribus aliis de causis, tum maxime quod ei, qui virtute belli omnibus gentibus praeferebantur, tantum se eius opinionis deperdidisse ut a populo Romano imperia perferrent gravissime dolebant.
 Treveri vero atque Indutiomarus totius hiemis nullum tempus intermiserunt, quin trans Rhenum legatos mitterent, civitates sollicitarent, pecunias pollicerentur, magna parte exercitus nostri interfecta multo minorem superesse dicerent partem. Neque tamen ulli civitati Germanorum persuaderi potuit, ut Rhenum transiret, cum se bis expertos dicerent, Ariovisti bello et Tencterorum transitu: non esse amplius fortunam temptaturos. Hac spe lapsus Indutiomarus nihilo minus copias cogere, exercere, a finitimis equos parare, exules damnatosque tota Gallia magnis praemiis ad se allicere coepit. Ac tantam sibi iam his rebus in Gallia auctoritatem comparaverat ut undique ad eum legationes concurrerent, gratiam atque amicitiam publice privatimque peterent.
 Ubi intellexit ultro ad se veniri, altera ex parte Senones Carnutesque conscientia facinoris instigari, altera Nervios Aduatucosque bellum Romanis parare, neque sibi voluntariorum copias defore, si ex finibus suis progredi coepisset, armatum concilium indicit. Hoc more Gallorum est initium belli, quo lege communi omnes puberes armati convenire consuerunt; qui ex eis novissimus convenit, in conspectu multitudinis omnibus cruciatibus affectus necatur. In eo concilio Cingetorigem, alterius principem factionis, generum suum, quem supra demonstravimus Caesaris secutum fidem ab eo non discessisse, hostem iudicat bonaque eius publicat. His rebus confectis, in concilio pronuntiat arcessitum se a Senonibus et Carnutibus aliisque compluribus Galliae civitatibus; huc iturum per fines Remorum eorumque agros populaturum ac, priusquam id faciat, castra Labieni oppugnaturum. Quae fieri velit praecipit.
 Labienus, cum et loci natura et manu munitissumis castris sese teneret, de suo ac legionis periculo nihil timebat; ne quam occasionem rei bene gerendae dimitteret, cogitabat. Itaque a Cingetorige atque eius propinquis oratione Indutiomari cognita, quam in concilio habuerat, nuntios mittit ad finitimas civitates equitesque undique evocat: his certum diem conveniendi dicit. Interim prope cotidie cum omni equitatu Indutiomarus sub castris eius vagabatur, alias ut situm castrorum cognosceret, alias colloquendi aut territandi causa: equites plerumque omnes tela intra vallum coniciebant. Labienus suos intra munitionem continebat timorisque opinionem, quibuscumque poterat rebus, augebat.
 Cum maiore in dies contemptione Indutiomarus ad castra accederet, nocte una intromissis equitibus omnium finitimarum civitatum quos arcessendos curaverat, tanta diligentia omnes suos custodiis intra castra continuit, ut nulla ratione ea res enuntiari aut ad Treveros perferri posset. Interim ex consuetudine cotidiana Indutiomarus ad castra accedit atque ibi magnam partem diei consumit; equites tela coniciunt et magna cum contumelia verborum nostros ad pugnam evocant. Nullo ab nostris dato responso, ubi visum est, sub vesperum dispersi ac dissipati discedunt. Subito Labienus duabus portis omnem equitatum emittit; praecipit atque interdicit, proterritis hostibus atque in fugam coniectis (quod fore, sicut accidit, videbat) unum omnes peterent Indutiomarum, neu quis quem prius vulneret, quam illum interfectum viderit, quod mora reliquorum spatium nactum illum effugere nolebat; magna proponit eis qui occiderint praemia; summittit cohortes equitibus subsidio. Comprobat hominis consilium fortuna, et cum unum omnes peterent, in ipso fluminis vado deprehensus Indutiomarus interficitur, caputque eius refertur in castra: redeuntes equites quos possunt consectantur atque occidunt. Hac re cognita omnes Eburonum et Nerviorum quae convenerant copiae discedunt, pauloque habuit post id factum Caesar quietiorem Galliam."

Eh kasi nabiktima ako
Nanahimik ako noong naglalakad
Tapos nahuli nakulong sa salang paghahangad
Sa isang bagay na di pwede, ibig sabihin ay bawal
Ang pag usad nga yata ng hustisya ay mabagal
Eh kasi ang tagal bago ko nakawala
Sa pantasyang maaring maging kaming dalawa
At nang matanggal ang kandado may naisip akong plano
Magpapayaman muna ako at magpapagwapo
Bago lumapit sayo aking nang naintindihan
Na ang mabuting damdamin di nakakain ang ganyan
Dapat meron nang ganyan
Sana di malito ang mga to ang gusto ko lang sabihin
Na ayusin ko muna sarili ko para sayo

Pag nasa entablado pangalan ko ay sigaw na rin

Hinigpitan ko pa ang kapit, di tulad kay Imelda Papin

Matapos ang taon na-traffic ay inakyat ko ang langit
At sa pagbango ng hangin ay napapikit ako

Yo se que te gustara, después de un polvo te enamoraras
Yo soy el genio de la lámpara, y te dije que la frotara
Tengo un oasis en el Sahara, tú eres una loca y te lo tragaras
Tenemos veneno pa' la gente mala
De mascota en mi casa hay un Tigre Bengala
Seguimos subiendo la escala, Loco cuidao con las bala
Esto es a la buena o a la mala

Me metí una perco, coronamos de nuevo, tienen lean tome coca
A tu gata le quito la ropa my nigga

Como cuando este negro te proboca
Parece petróleo contando dinero, Arabe y no e jalao

Pero no significa que no te la dejamos a ti pisa
Me estoy buscando como un árabe, en pinta de cabeza a pie
Tu jeva moja de' que me ve, millones yo se que tu ve

Ella tiene un novio que no la completa
La deja a mitad y ella puta y bien fresca
Por eso me llama y me espera coqueta
Pa' que la consienta y después se lo meta
Yo siempre estoy puesto y logro lo que quiero
Me se to' los códigos y to' los juideros

Por estúpido, idiota y no tener actitud
No sabes na de mi tu ni sabes quien soy

Porqué el que es traicionero es de los mio hoy
Come de lo que como y va a donde yo voy

Samut-saring mga istorya at iba't ibang mukha
Ngunit san man ako dalhin ng hangin wala parin ibang pipiliin makasama
Pinapangarap ko sa twina
Mahagkan at mamasdan pagkat ikaw parin ang aking tahanan
Tahanan, na na na
Tahanan, na na na
Tahanan, na na na
Na na na na na
Aking nilibot at inikot ang mga pasikot sikot
Nadaanan kahit pa yung iskinita na makipot
May daanang maluwag, baku-bako at merong patag
Gulong-gulo ang isip at hindi na mapanatag
Sumagupa sa ulan at sa araw ay nakababad
Kailan ulit ang banig sayo mailalatag
Ikaw ang hanap-hanap gusto kang balikan
Masasayang ala-ala kinasasabikan
Ikaw ang aking kanlungan, ang nagsisilbing silungan
Aking pinaghuhugutan tuwing may kalungkutan sa aking paglalakbay sa may patag ako hinanay
Sa hamon ng buhay sa pagsubok ako sinanay
Tuloy-tuloy sa paghakbang
Kahit pa mayrong hadlang
Pupunan ko ang patlang
Sa pamamagitan nang
Pag-ibig na walang hangganan, hangganan, hangganan
Ikaw ikaw ikaw
Ikaw puso ko aking tahanan
Kung saan, saan, saan na nagpunta
Samut-saring mga istorya at iba't ibang mukha
Ngunit san man ako dalhin ng hangin
Wala paring ibang pipiliing makasama
Pinapangarap ko sa twina
Mahagkan at mamasdan
Pagkat ikaw parin ang aking tahanan
Di na mabilang ang hakbang ng aking mga paa
At ang mga nasilayan ng aking mata
Sa labas ng tahanan ay may magagandang tanawin
Ngunit taglay ko parin dadaming di kayang dayain
Ikaw ang pipiliing laging makatabi
Kapag malayo ka sakin halos di mapakali
Hindi inisip ang sariling kapakanan
Ni minsan di kumaliwa ang lakad laging pakanan
Tumalikod sa tukso
Tuloy ang pusong lumukso
Mamahalin ka ng gusto pagkat ikaw lang ang gusto
Makasama, makapiling
Ikaw na nga marahil ang tibok ng damdamin kahit na meron pang hilahil
Tuloy-tuloy sa paghakbang
Kahit pa merong hadlang
Pupunan ko ang patlang
Sa pamamagitan nang
Pag-ibig na walang hangganan, hangganan, hangganan
Ikaw ikaw ikaw
Ikaw puso ko aking tahanan
Kung saan, saan, saan na nagpunta
Samut-saring mga istorya at iba't ibang mukha
Ngunit san man ako dalhin ng hangin
Wala paring ibang pipiliing makasama
Pinapangarap ko sa twina
Mahagkan at mamasdan pagkat ikaw parin
Ang aking tahanan
Iniwanan ka't pinakawalan
Nilibot ang mundo upang hanapin ang kahulugan ng pag-ibig
(At ang pusong naligaw, lumayo man ang ating landas
Laging tanaw ay ikaw
Mabilis man lumipas ng oras, araw, buwan at taon
Matiyaga ako na nag-antay sa tamang pagkakataon
Ito ang panahon)
Kaya ngayon di na pa kaya pang malayo ang puso kong ito
At kung saan, saan, saan na nagpunta
Samut-saring mga istorya at iba't ibang mukha
Ngunit san man ako dalhin ng hangin
Wala paring ibang pipiliing makasama
Pinapangarap ko sa twina
Mahagkan at mamasdan
Pagkat ikaw parin

195,180460400,Paliparan,Ron Henley feat. Jameson,[18],['Hip Hop/Rap'],"'Di sa pagdadrama
Mas  malungkot pa sa bagsak ng tunog na 'to ang aking nadarama
Ako  ay lumuluha patago habang nakatayo
Pinagmamasdan ka papalayo
Sa bawat pagsubok, alam kong tayo ay lalago
At  sa alaala ko habambuhay naka-tattoo
Minsan  may araw na hindi pinapalaro ni Jawo
Kahit bano, sinamahan mo 'kong maupo sa may bangko
Basa  man ang lansangan, tuyo man ang ulam
Tayo'y nababalot sa kumot at unan
At tanging sa platito lang ang ating tagpuan
Sa mundo kung sa'n pinagkasundo ang asukal at suman
Umapaw  ng larawan at tawanan magdamagan
Magkahawak ng kamay, inaabot ang kalawakan
Masyado tayong nagsaya
Naniningil ang kalungkutan at ang pintuan ay tuluyan na ngang nagsara

Ang tag-init umabot na ng anim na buwan
Kung minsan tatlong linggo lang
Ngunit sa tuwing bumabalik siya ng kanyang kaharian
Halos laging tag-ulan
Halos laging tag-ulan, halos laging tag-ulaaan
Halos laging tag-ulan 'pag nagpapaalam
Sa tuwing ihahatid ko ang aking kasintahan
Sa paliparan

Nasaktan lang kita, habang wala ka
Ako'y nasa kama ng iba, 'di ko talaga kayang mag-isa
Gantihan hanggang sa lumala, nagkasakitan
Praningan dahil puro kasinungalingan
'Di ko na kailangang salagin, ako ang salarin
Kaya minsan nahihiyang harapin ang aming salamin
Dahil nagawa ko 'to sa babaeng nagmahal nang wagas sa akin
Nagnais lang namang maibalik ang tingkad ng dating
Kulay ng pag-iibigan na parang bahaghari
Kung sa'n panay bulaklak at masagana 'yung ani
Pinaghalong lungkot at panghihinayang
Ilang taon ding iginapang, nawala lang, tuluyan lang nasayang
Baon mo ang ating plano pagsakay ng eroplano
Kaso sabay sa 'yong paglipad, agad itong naglaho
Bago ka umalis at bago rin ito matapos
Nais ko lang munang magpaalam sa'yo nang maayos, uh!

Ang tag-init umabot na ng anim na buwan
Kung minsan tatlong linggo lang
Ngunit sa tuwing bumabalik siya ng kanyang kaharian
Halos laging tag-ulan
Halos laging tag-ulan, halos laging tag-ulaaan
Halos laging tag-ulan 'pag nagpapaalam
Sa tuwing ihahatid ko ang aking kasintahan
Sa paliparan

Tapos na nga ba tayo? O baka naman hindi pa?
Bakit mali pa rin ng isa't isa ang ating nakikita?
Nababawasan na nga ba ang paglalambingan natin?
Para akong lalagnatin sa t'wing nanlalamig ka sa' kin
Marahil nagawa ko lang 'to
Dahil may mga nagawa ka rin sa akin na nasaktan ako
Kaya no'ng nalulungkot ka, ako 'yung hinahanap mo
Ngunit mas pinakinggan ko 'yung tawag ng laman kaysa sa tawag mo
'Di naman kailangang magka-ilangan dahil lamang nagkasigawaan
Kung ika'y nahihirapan, ang bigat gumagaan 'pag binibitawan
Parang tubig sa bakal, hinangin tapos kinalawang
Nakalusot ka sa lansangang akala ko'y walang kaliwaan
Kaya salamat na lang sa pabaong alaala
May napulot akong aral sa ating pagsasama
Buhol-buhol man ang sinulid ng ating kahapon
Ay naitawid naman natin sa butas ng karayum

Ang tag-init umabot na ng anim na buwan
Kung minsan tatlong linggo lang
Ngunit sa tuwing bumabalik siya ng kanyang kaharian
Halos laging tag-ulan
Halos laging tag-ulan, halos laging tag-ulaaan
Halos laging tag-ulan 'pag nagpapaalam
Sa tuwing ihahatid ko ang aking kasintahan
Sa paliparan

Sa tuwing may bagong darating ay meron ding naiiwanan
Palakad-lakad mag-isa sa may hintayan
Sa tuwing may bagong darating ay meron ding naiiwanan
Ang dami pa nating sinasabi, anim na letra lang ang salitang ""paalam"""

Akala ko sa teleserye lang nangyayari
Ang mga istorya ng pagibig na ganito
Eh totoo naman pala ang mga sabi sabi
Eh kasi nabiktima ako
Nanahimik ako noong naglalakad
Tapos nahuli nakulong sa salang paghahangad
Sa isang bagay na di pwede, ibig sabihin ay bawal
Ang pag usad nga yata ng hustisya ay mabagal
Eh kasi ang tagal bago ko nakawala
Sa pantasyang maaring maging kaming dalawa
At nang matanggal ang kandado may naisip akong plano
Magpapayaman muna ako at magpapagwapo
Bago lumapit sayo aking nang naintindihan
Na ang mabuting damdamin di nakakain ang ganyan
Dapat meron nang ganyan
Sana di malito ang mga to ang gusto ko lang sabihin
Na ayusin ko muna sarili ko para sayo
Chorus:
Mabuti nalang (lang, lang)
Nasa tamang pag iisip
Alam-lam kong pag di pwede wag ipilit
Posible ka lang maipit sa komplikadong sitwasyon
Wag magpahadlang (lang, lang)
At wag kang mag papabwisit
Wag nang nang nang mag mukmok dyaan sa gilid
Gamitin mo ang pagibig bilang isang inspirasyon
Ang pag ibig ay isang inspirasyon
Ang pag ibig ay isang inspirasyon
Dapat ang pag ibig ay isang inspirasyon (isang inspirasyon)
Verse 2:
Lumipas ang ilang taon mula sa lupa nakabangon
Hindi nako nanghihingi sa nanay ko ng baon
Kilala nako ng mga tao doon sa kanto
At kahit na papano may pera nako sa bangko
Mabilis ang pangyayari grabe
Ang dating hindi napapansin, tinitilian na ng mga babae
Pag nasa entablado pangalan ko ay sigaw na rin
Pero sakin walang nagbago walang iba ikaw pa rin
Hinigpitan ko pa ang kapit, di tulad kay Imelda Papin
Ang pagibig na galing sakin higit sa isang linggo
Matapos ang taon na-traffic ay inakyat ko ang langit
At sa pagbango ng hangin ay napapikit ako
Kasi bago lumapit sayo akin nang naintindihan
Na marami akong hirap na dadanasin sa daan
Nalampasan ko ang dami na yan at para di malito ang mga to
Salamat sa inspirasyon naiayos ko ang sarili ko dahil sayo
Chorus:
Mabuti nalang (lang, lang)
Nasa tamang pag iisip
Alam-lam kong pag di pwede wag ipilit
Posible ka lang maipit sa komplikadong sitwasyon
Wag magpahadlang (lang, lang)
At wag kang mag papabwisit
Wag nang nang nang mag mukmok dyaan sa gilid

At saka isang diyosang mapagkumbaba
Ano kaya ang mangyayari sa wakas

Yo me estoy buscando como un arabe
Mange una morena y me la enganche
Si tu no me crees entonces ven a ver

Yo me estoy buscando como un árabe saudí
Tengo cincuenta puta en el cuarto y to'as son pa' mi
Sin panty y con tus guantes negro hasta los tobillos
Me hice millo y voy a montar un castillo oro amarillo
Yo tengo una deuda por el mundo de anormales
No hagas que mi Glock en tu cabeza se dispare
Enganche trabajo en las fuerzas digitales
Y dale por el agua, por el piso y por el aire
Los árabes tienen conexiones magicas
Los AK me llegan fulete de fábrica
(Prrr) Pa' romperte, quinientos meterte
Y verte envolverte, abrazao con la muerte
Mis enemies saben que Ñengo es un demente
Las putas se vienen con un chorro e' fulete
Parar difícil, sonando en ISIS
Me dan la pussy todas las missy
To' los días siempre subo de nivel
Real G4 Life aumentando el poder
Por el desierto del Sahara, clavando putas caras
Mi maldito flow nadie lo para, porqué
Muchos roncan y tiran la mala, pero
Aquí nos defendemos con balas, fuck it
Vendiendo, vendiendo, fumando, prendiendo
Moviendo, moviendo, el fuego subiendo (Ahora e')

Yo me estoy buscando como un árabe
Tengo par de piezas, como treinta y tres
Me metí una perco, ahora yo estoy grabe
Soy la conexión porqué tengo el cable
Cuanto a mi me miran y aunque me admiran
Detrás de mi espalda se viran, después de esta nunca respira
Esta AK que tengo retira, dale que soy gigolo
Le damos a tu cuero, ella quiere agarrame a mi las bolas
Mientras le chupo el culo
Esto se puso encendeo-eo-eo-eo-eo-eo llegaron los feos
A tu jevita ya yo le di deo la lleve a las estrellas como Galileo
Ponteme en cuatro deja el paniqueo
Después que yo te de en la cara yo te meo
Le doy un pedazo de este bichote
Así es que le estoy sacando to' los peo
Asa la maleco, mole con sala
Cuando yo me busque no me venga a lán
Tali Talibán, flow de Afghanistan
Yo resuelvo todo los problemas
Un chaleco e' bomba y ¡Bam! ¡Bam!

Yo me estoy buscando como un árabe, árabe
Mange una morena y me la enganche, enganche
Si tu no me crees pues entonces ven a ve, ven a ve
Con tu tenis Jordan ready pa' correr, pa' correr

Yo me estoy buscando como que vendo petróleo
Tengo una casa en Dubai y un hotel en Juan Dolio
Una barba gigantesca que me tapa el cuello
Cinco esposas que tu no le puedes ver el cabello
Soy pana del papa del presidente de Qatar
Cuando se me muere alguien Allahu Akbar
¿Tu te estas quejando que no paro de llamar?
Okay, una mamadita y no te vuelvo a molestar
¿Qué tengo grajo? Estas en lo cierto
Párese que abajo de los sobaco tengo un muerto
Tal vez porqué aquí hay guerra cada vez que estoy despierto
O porque me la paso montando camello en el desierto, y
