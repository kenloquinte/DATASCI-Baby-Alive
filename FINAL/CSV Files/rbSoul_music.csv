You know, you know, I just wanna talk
Dobidodoop doop daraahh ehh
Halos limang oras na akong nag-aantay sa iyo
Nag-aabang ako sa labas ng bahay niyo
Sipat ng sipat kung sisilip ka ba sa bintana
Magpakita ka'y parang 'di yata
Ilang beses ka nang lagi na lang ganyan
Kung iwasan ako'y parang ayaw akong nandyan
Sa susunod na punta ko'y pagbuksan mo na sana
Kase kahit anong mangyari ay 'di ako mawawalan ng pag-asa
Ayaw kitang pilitin kung 'di ka pa handa
Sa susunod nalang, sa susunod nalang
Ayaw kong nabibitin kaya mabuti pang
Ako'y uuwi nalang, sa susunod nalang
Napupuyat na ko kakapa-alala
Kumain at mag-ingat kung sakaling maggala ka
Laging sinisipat ang imahe ng dalaga
Na pangarap makasama ko sa hirap at ginhawa
Tipikal na dahilan ng tagahanga mong
Hindi naghahanap ng iba kahit na nababatong
Naghihintay sayong sagot sa'king mga tinatanong
Habang ang pamantayan mo ay pilit kong tinatalon
Kase alam ko na hindi ka pa handa
May gusto kang makita pa sa'kin at madama
Kaya 'eto ako naghahanda 'kong madapa
Kung mabigo sa ngayon ayos lang kase may bukas pa
'Di nauubos yun kaya kahit kumukunot na ang noo ko
Ay sa alon naten ay sumusunod nalang
Susuyuin ka kahit hindi mo pa mapunuan
Yung ikaw sa salitang tayo ayos lang sa susunod nalang
Ayaw kitang pilitin kung 'di ka pa handa
Sa susunod nalang, sa susunod nalang
Ayaw kong nabibitin kaya mabuti pang
Ako'y uuwi nalang, sa susunod nalang
Ayaw kitang pilitin kung 'di ka pa handa
Sa susunod nalang, sa susunod nalang
Ayaw kong nabibitin kaya mabuti pang
Ako'y uuwi nalang, sa susunod nalang
Ayaw kitang pilitin kung 'di ka pa handa
Sa susunod nalang, sa susunod nalang
Ayaw kong nabibitin kaya mabuti pang
Ako'y uuwi nalang, sa susunod nalang"

Kalimutan mo na yung mga nakaraan
May pagkakataon pa para merong masimulan

Ngayong pasko ay magbigayan
Kung may galit magpatawad
'Yan lang ang mahalaga
'Yan lang ang mahalaga

Dahil 'di naman kasi sa galit nakukuha
Pagiging masaya mo ang pinakauna
Ang dapat na gawin ay magpatawad ka na
'Pagkat hindi rin masama na magbigay sa iba
Kahit 'di pa nakaplano sa iyo
Wala ng dapat ikatakot sa kung ano
Man ang kalalabasan, isipin mo lang
Na mas mahirap din kapag wala kang pagmamahal
Sa mundong 'to ay 'di naman tayo payabangan
May rason kung bakit tayo nagkakaganyan
Wag mo lang kalilimutan ang paghuhugutan
Mo ng lakas ay ang nasa taas siya lang ang 'yong paniwalaan
Ialay mo lang lahat nang gumaan
Ang loob mo kung ano man ang 'yong dahilan

Paano ba 'ko
Kapag ika’y sumuko
Hindi na 'to maibabalik sa simple kong regalo
Pagod na 'ko na magpanggap na tayo’y masaya
Ayusin natin na agad kapag lumalala
Alam naman natin pareho sa isa’t isa
Palagi tayo nag-aaway
'Pag nakakasama ka
Bakit hindi mo pa sabihin
Ayokong uulit-ulitin
Masyado ka nang matampuhin
Seryoso ako sa'ting pag-ibig
Ayoko na kasi mawala ka
Puro away at bati nakakasawa
Minsan lang naman tayo magkakasama

Yuh!
Minsan 'di ko na masagot
Ang mga text at tawag niyo
Dahil palaging pagod
Pasensya na kung mas napili ko na magkalayo
Pero asahan pag-uwi ko ay babawi ako
Nakakamiss kayo na laging kasama
Madalas na hinahanap-hanap luto ni mama
Hindi na ko makahintay na makabalik
Para makakwentuhan at makainuman si papa
Ang bawat paguwi, gusto laging surpresa
Pagdating ng hapunan ay kumpleto sa mesa
Pagkatapos pupunasan ko mga luha sa mata
Ni mama ng dahil sa telenovela
Laking salamat ko sa Diyos kayo’y binigay
Hindi malilimutan ang pangaral niyo at gabay
Basta alam ko na andyan kayo at sumusuporta
At ramdam ko ang pagmamahal niyo sa'kin na sobra

Naaalala mo pa ba ko
Oh, pwede bang bati na tayo oh
Kalimutan mo na yung mga nakaraan
May pagkakataon pa para merong masimulan

Ngayong pasko ay magbigayan
Kung may galit magpatawad
'Yan lang ang mahalaga
'Yan lang ang mahalaga
'Yan lang ang mahalaga

Mga magandang ala-ala nating
Ngayon sa'kin nagpapangiti
'Di ko naman akalain
Na sa away rin pala mauuwi
Ang hindi na magbati ay 'di na bago
Kaya ako ay humihingi ng kapatawaran sa ‘yo
Ahhhh
Hindi ko na matiis
Ahhh
Parang ika'y namimiss
Ko oho oho
Patawarin mo na ako oho oho
‘Wag na sanang
Pahabain pa
Ang galit sa
Isa't isa

Ngayong pasko ay magbigayan
Kung may galit magpatawad
'Yan lang ang mahalaga
'Yan lang ang mahalaga"

Please lang, gumawa ka ng paraan
Para ako’y makita, para ako’y matikman
Alam mo ba miss na miss na kita
Baby, halika na
Sobrang lungkot na talaga
'Pag wala ka dito sa tabi ko
Lalo na pag napaisip pa sa’yo
Wala nang magawa kung 'di tumulog nalang
Para ikaw ang mapanaginipan ko
Ikaw ang nasa puso’t isipan ko
At panalangin na habang buhay na 'to

Nung ika'y lumapit
Ako'y biglang napakapit
Nag tataka kung bakit
Muli kang sumasabit
Sa buhay ko
Diba tapos na tayo?
Ano ang dahilan bakit ka pa naririto?
Ngayo'y nag babalik
Ikaw ba ay nananabik?
Sakin o sadyang wala ka lang matakbuhan?
Ano ang katotohanan ng ating kamustahan
Nanjan kapag may kailangan tapos ako'y tatalikuran

Bakit nga ba hinayaan
Natin to na mawala
Ano nga ba ang mga rason na sa atin nagdala
Na tapusin ng maaga ang ating nasimulan
Hindi na natin maibabalik
Mga panahon na dating tayo   ay sabik
Dahilan kung bakit tila nawalan na ng gana
Magbigay ng pagpapahalaga at umibig pang ulit
YAH!!
Sabihin mo sakin ano ang problema kung bat naririto
Hindi yung babalik ka lamang kung kailan mo lamang gusto
Handa naman akong magsilbing balikat kapag malungkot
Pero asahan mo na di na ko babalik, at yan ang totoo

Tukso ang dala dala
Ano ba ang 'yong kailangan
Walang ibang matakbuhan
O wala ka lang mahanap
Na tunay na magmamahal
Sa katulad mo
Kundi ako lang
Pero...
Hanggang ngayon ay sariwa parin
Ang mga ala-ala, na iyong iniwan
Di basta matalikuran madalas
Balik tanawin, ganon ka parin
Walang pinagkaiba sa dati 'nung ikaw ay makilala
Mga oras na kasama kita ay maligaya
Ako'y nagsunod-sunuran
Ngunit ang 'yong balak
Lang pala nung umpisa pa lamang ako ay utuin
Ako naman si tanga
Na umaasang kaya mo rin akong mahalin
Ang galing mo rin, dahil alam mo na di kita matitis
Kaya di ko na ninais na muling mapalapit
Kaya Kung pwede ba ay lumayo ka sandali
Isipin ko muna kung puso ba ay sususndin
Sapagkat akoy dala na pagod na kakaluha
Sa bangungot mong dala ay matagal nang nagising

Paligid ay palaging masyadong malamig
Itong pagibig natin aminadong nasaid
Kahit pa pilitin nating tumawid
Alam ko na wala rin namang makikinig
Kapag ka sumasagi ay nakakasabik
Muli na maranasan ulit na makilig
Kaso mukang malabo na yatang bumalik
Kung ating napamuka na isarado ang bibig
Bintana'y binuksan at idinungaw ang mata
Nakita kita na ikaw din ay nagiisa
Ako ay bumaba na para makausap kita
Kahit na pano'y lumuwag ang paghinga
Hindi talaga natin gustong magkaganito
Alam ko naman na ayaw mo narin ng gulo
Kaso sa totoo lang kasi ay aminado
Ako na hindi na din kita kaya na masalo

Nung ika'y lumapit
Ako'y biglang napakapit
Nag tataka kung bakit
Muli kang sumasabit
Sa buhay ko
Diba tapos na tayo?
Ano ang dahilan bakit ka pa naririto?

Tinatanong kita ano ba
Ngayon bakit di ka na makasagot
Ngayon nasan na kasama mo tumalon
Nang ikaw ay mapasakin na tila'y papalarin
Ngayun di na magawa na ngumiti
Nakikinig ka pa ba saken?
Di mo marinig, meron ka bang tutuli?
Na lobo na pumutok sa langit sana pagkain na lang binili
Di ko alam kung kelan ba naging tayo sa sobra mo nang makasarili
Tang ina
Kailan ma'y hindi pa tumingin sa iba
Kelangan pa kita, bakit ka nagpabili sa iba
Kung sino sino ang kinakasama
Ngayon bakit umaasa kang ulit na saluhin pa kita
Ayaw mo ng mahipit pero dapat lang akong maging madamot
Sa ilalim ng kumot maraming tinatago
Gusto mo lahat sayo kumamot
Kasama ka pero pagmamahal mo ay wala na
Parang hawak ang kamay ng hindi ko na kakilala
Ngayon pa'no na
Ako ay pagod na
Masanay ka ngayong mabuhay ngayon ng mag isa
Alam mong mali na bakit mas pinili mo pa
Ang desisyon na alam mong ikaw lang ang liligaya

Ano ang dahilan? Ano ang dahilan? Woah
Hindi ko maintindihan kung pano
Mo nagagawa para bang lahat ng 'to ay nakaplano
Alam kong wala akong pagkukulang pero bat mo ba nakukuhang
Umalis ng wala manlang pasintabi, magulang ka pa sa magulang
Bakit ba di ako mapakali gusto ka pa din katabi
Madalas nag-aabang sa iyo habang ikaw ay puro ka lamang salisi
Bawat gabi di na maipinta mukha ko sa tabi-tabi
Gusto ko lang malaman kung ano ba talaga kasi ayoko maniwala sa mga sabi-sabi la la la la
Wag kang mag-alala dahil pakikinggan naman kita
Minu-minuto kita na iintindihin at pasasayahin kahit pa
Kaso lang hindi na ako yung buo ang tiwala dahilan ng kawalang bahala mo sakin
Tutal dyan ka masaya pero di pwedeng ako lang yong kawawa

Biglang nagbago ang ihip ng hangin
Madalas na yatang ganyan ka sa akin
Sinong may diprensya hindi ko na malaman
Sa lahat ng kalokohan mo wala kong kinalaman
Ano ang aking gagawin ang hirap mong intindihin
Pilit kitang inuunawa pero bat ganun pa din
Ano ang paniniwalaan ano ang totoo
Sino ba satin nagsasabi ng totoo
Ayokong umabot sa punto na tayo magkalokohan
Ang pakiusap ko sana ay magawa mo ko na pahalagahan

Isang gabing puro usapan kung bakit ka nang-iwan
Ano ang dahilan? Ano ang dahilan? Woah
Sana alam ko na yung dahilan
Madami ang babae na nagkandarapa dyan
Sa pwesto mo oh please ano ba ang dahilan
Bat di mo oh idaan sa usapan
Yung mga lambing mo yun laging hanap ko
Isipin mo ng mali ay di ko magagawa
Madalas topakin ka ang maglambing ay wala
Ang umalis ka ng bigla hindi ko kinaya
Teka lang chill muna tayo pag-usapan natin to
Tila bang pinaikot mo lang ang aking mundo
Sa dami-dami ng ginawa ko sayong napakaganda
Tila ba mali ko pa ang lagi mong nakikita
Sino bang may diperensya sa ating dalawa
Tingnan mo muna ang sarili mo bago manghusga
Isang gabing puro usapan kung bakit ka nang-iwan
Ano ang dahilan? Ano ang dahilan? Woah
Bat umalis lahat naman ay ginawa para sayo
Di nainis kahit ako ay nagmukhang tanga sayo
Bakit parang lahat ng ginagawa ko ay mali para sayo
Tapos ikaw pa ang may gana na magsabi na nakakasawa na ako
Wala naman akong ginawa kundi suyuin ka gabi-gabi
Ang gusto ko lang naman ay makasama, mayakap ka't makatabi
Malabo na ngang maayos pa ang relasyon natin
Kaya magpapaalam na pasensya di ko na kinaya
Di na kita kilala ika'y ibang iba ika'y nagbago na (Soulstice)

Mga gawi kong parang hindi pambabae eh kasi
Imbes na chinese garter, laruan ko ay teks at jolens
Tapos ka-jamming ko lagi noon
Mga sigang lalaki sa amin

Nung ako'y mag high school ay
Napabarkada sa mga bi-curious na babae na
Ang hanap din ay babae
Sa halip na makeup kit, bitbit ko ay gitara
Tapos pormahan ko lagi ay long sleeves na
T-shirt at faded na lonta

Pero noong nakilala kita
Nagbagong bigla ang aking timpla
Natuto ako na magparebond at
Mag-ahit ng kilay at least once a month
Hindi ko alam kung anong meron ka na
Sa akin ay nagpalambot nang bigla
Sinong mag-aakalang lalake pala
Ang bibihag sa tulad kong tigreng gala

Kahit ako'y titibo-tibo
Puso ko ay titibok-tibok pa rin sa'yo
Isang halik mo lamang, at ako ay tinatablan
At ang aking pagkababae ay nabubuhayan
Na para bang bulaklak na namumukadkad
Dahil alaga mo sa dilig at katamtamang
Sikat ng araw-araw mong pag-ibig
Sa 'king buhay nagpapasarap
Nung tayo'y nag-college ay
Saka ko lamang binigay ang matamis na oo
Sampung buwan mong trinabaho
Sa halip na tsokolate at tipikal na mga diskarte
Nabihag mo ko sa mga tula at sa mga kanta mong pabebe

Kaya nga noong makilala kita
Alam ko na agad na mayroong himala
Natuto akong magtakong at napadalas
Ang pagsuot ng bestidang pula
Pero 'di mo naman inasam na ako ay
Magbagong tuluyan para patunayang
Walang matigas na tinapay sa mainit na kape
Ng iyong pagmamahal

Kahit ako'y titibo-tibo
Puso ko ay titibok-tibok pa rin sa'yo
Isang halik mo lamang, at ako ay tinatablan
At ang aking pagkababae ay nabubuhayan
Na para bang bulaklak na namumukadkad

English Translation

Ever since elementary grade, they're already noticing
My gestures that are unlady-like 'coz
Instead of chinese garter, my toys were trading cards and marbles
Then I always jam with
Gangster-like boys in our place

When I entered high school
I was friends with bi's--curious girls
Who also like girls
Instead of makeup kit, I bring my guitar
Then I always wore long-sleeved
T-shirt and faded pants

But when I met you
My flavor changed
I learned to have my hair rebonded
Shape my eyebrows at least once a month
I don't know what it is that you have that
Had me soften suddenly
Who would have thought it will be a man
Who'll capture a wild tiger like me
Even if I am boyish
My heart still beats for you
Just one kiss from you, and you've got me hooked
And the woman in me is awakened
Just like a blooming flower
Because you care for it with water and sufficient
Light of your everyday love
That makes my life sweet

When we went to college
Was just when I gave you my sweet ""yes""
That you've worked for 10 months
Instead of chocolates and typical moves
You captured me with your poems and your corny songs

That's why when I met you
I already knew that miracles are true
I learned to wear heels and frequented
Wearing red dress
But you didn't wish me to
Change completely just to prove
That there is no hard bread to a hot coffee
Of your love

Even if I am boyish
My heart still beats for you
Just one kiss from you, and you've got me hooked
And the woman in me is awakened
Just like a blooming flower
Because you care for it with water and sufficient
Light of your everyday love
That makes my life sweet"

HOOK:
Gusto kita na mapasakin, kahit na mali
Katabi ka ng matagal at di lang ngayong gabi
Hiling ko sanay matupad ako'y di na mapakali
Gawin nating lagi nakaw nating sandali
Gusto kita na mapasakin, kahit na mali
Katabi ka ng matagal at di lang ngayong gabi
Hiling ko sanay matupad ako'y di na mapakali
Gawin nating lagi nakaw nating sandali, wooh"

Pabagalin muna natin ang ikot ng mundo

Sobrang saya dahil
Nandito ka na kahit
Mamaya lang
Ay aalis ka na rin agad
Wag ka sanang mainis
Panahon nati'y mabilis

Di naman nagmamadali, di'ba?
Dantay ka muna sakin beh
Sulitin natin ang gabi
Iyong mga problema'y itabi
Labi mo saakin idampi at

Kahit anong lalim
Aking sisisirin
Hindi na mabibitin
Pa sa aking gagawin
Pabagalin muna natin ang ikot ng mundo
(Ako'y sasayaw sa himig mo atin ang gabi na 'to)
Pahintuin mga kamay ng oras sa relo

Hanggang dito ka lang

Pano na 'ko pag gabi?
Di sanay nang walang katabi
Sandal mo muna sandali
Di naman nagmamadali, kaya

D E C I S I O N
MENDOZA, J.:
This is a petition for review on certiorari of the decision of the Sixteenth Division of the Court of Appeals in CA-G.R. SP No. 41896 entitled, ""Amelita Dolfo v. Hon. Novato T. Cajigal, et al."" Said decision upheld the orders dated May 7, 1996 and August 22, 1996 of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 19, Bacoor, Cavite, in LRC Case Nos. B-89-14 and B-90-6 denying petitioner's motion for leave to intervene and/or admit complaint in intervention as well as her motion for reconsideration. The petition likewise assails the appellate court's resolution denying petitioner's motion for reconsideration and the trial court's joint decision recognizing the rights of private respondents over a parcel of land located in Barangay Lantic, Carmona, Cavite which is the subject of the abovesaid LRC Cases.
The pertinent facts are as follows:
On March 5, 1996, petitioner and Yangtze Properties, Inc. (Yangtze) filed a motion for leave to file and/or admit complaint-in-intervention in LRC Cases Nos. B-94-60, B-89-14 and B-90-6 pending before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 19, Bacoor, Cavite. The first case is for reconstitution of Original Certificate of Title No. 362 purportedly covering the subject real property, while the last two were cases for registration of title. Petitioner alleged that she is the registered owner of the real property subject of the said LRC Cases as shown by Transfer Certificate of Title No. T-320601 issued in her name by the Register of Deeds of Trece Martires City. Yangtze, petitioner's co-movant, had earlier entered into a Contract to Sell with petitioner over the said property. In its order dated May 7, 1996, the trial court denied the aforementioned motion on the grounds that: 1) it is a procedural error to file a complaint for intervention in cases involving original application for land registration, the proceedings therein being in rem; and 2) there had already been an order of general default entered by the court against those who failed to oppose the applications. The trial court noted petitioner's failure to exercise any act of dominion over the subject property consistent with her allegation of ownership. On May 15, 1996, petitioner and Yangtze filed a motion for reconsideration of the May 7, 1996 order. The trial court, treating the motion as a motion to lift the order of general default, denied the same in its order dated August 22, 1996. The trial court gave greater weight to the report of the Land Registration Authority (LRA) that petitioner's certificate of title was issued without any legal basis and the report of the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) that the signature of Antonia Cabuco, the Register of Deeds of the Province of Cavite signatory on the certificate, was a forgery. This is notwithstanding the documents proffered by petitioner allegedly showing the genuineness of the signature of Antonia Cabuco on the certificate of title. The trial court opined that petitioner's title over the subject property was of doubtful nature and that allowing her to intervene in the LRC cases would unduly delay the proceedings.
Meanwhile, on August 1, 1996, Atty. Artemio Caña, in his capacity as Acting Register of Deeds of the Province of Cavite, filed a complaint for the annulment of petitioner's certificate of title before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 89, Bacoor, Cavite. The matter remains pending in that court.
On the other hand, the Regional Trial Court, Branch 19, Bacoor, Cavite rendered a joint decision recognizing and confirming the rights of private respondents over the litigated property and ordered the issuance of a Decree of Registration in their favor.
Later, petitioner filed before the Court of Appeals a petition for certiorari and mandamus to annul and set aside the above orders of the Regional Trial Court, Branch 19, Bacoor, Cavite. Petitioner also prayed that the latter be compelled to give due course to her motion for leave to intervene and/or admit complaint-in-intervention. The petition was later amended to include the LRA as party respondent.
On October 20, 1997, the Court of Appeals rendered its decision denying the petition due course, the dispositive portion of which reads:
WHEREFORE, the petition is hereby DENIED DUE COURSE and is DISMISSED. Costs against petitioner.
SO ORDERED.
The Court of Appeals likewise denied petitioner's motion for reconsideration in its resolution dated April 21, 1998.
Petitioner now contends that:
I. THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS GRAVELY ERRED IN HOLDING THAT THE PROPER REMEDY IN THE LAND REGISTRATION CASES IS AN OPPOSITION TO THE APPLICATION OF THE APPLICANTS, AND NOT A MOTION TO INTERVENE IN THE PROCEEDINGS BEFORE THE TRIAL COURT.
II. THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN NOT HOLDING THAT THE RESPONDENT TRIAL COURT GRAVELY ERRED IN NOT ADMITTING PETITIONER'S MOTION FOR INTERVENTION ON THE BASIS OF PETITIONER'S POSSESSION OF HER INDEFEASIBLE TITLE OVER THE SUBJECT PROPERTIES.
III. THE RESPONDENT COURT OF APPEALS SERIOUSLY ERRED IN NOT UPHOLDING THE TITLE OF THE PETITIONER, TCT NO. T-320601, OVER THE PROPERTIES IN QUESTION DESPITE PETITIONER'S OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE TO PROVE THE GENUINENESS AND DUE EXECUTION OF HER TITLE, AND DESPITE ITS EXPRESS AND CATEGORICAL ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF THE FACT THAT PETITIONER INDEED PRESENTED NUMEROUS DOCUMENTS TO PROVE THE AUTHENTICITY OF HER TITLE.
We find petitioner's contentions unmeritorious.
First. The provisions of §§ 14 and 25 of P.D. No. 1529 (Property Registration Decree) show that the applicant and the oppositor are the only parties in cases of original applications for land registration, unlike in ordinary civil actions where parties may include the plaintiff, the defendant, third party complainants, cross-claimants, and intervenors.
It is now settled that a motion to intervene in a land registration case cannot be allowed. A party wishing to be heard should ask for the lifting of the order of general default, and then if lifted, file an opposition to the application for registration. This is so because proceedings in land registration are in rem and not in personam, the sole object being the registration applied for, not the determination of any right connected with the registration.
Second. Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals made a factual finding that petitioner's title to the land is of doubtful authenticity.
Having jurisdiction only to resolve questions of law, this Court is bound by the factual findings of the trial court and the Court of Appeals. Even if intervention is allowed in cases of original registration of title, petitioner cannot rely on her certificate of title in view of the evidence respecting its genuineness. As correctly held by the Court of Appeals:
Moreover, even if intervention is proper, petitioner's reliance on her title is infirm. While she presented numerous documents to prove its authenticity, however, they have been disputed by Benjamin Flestado, Chief of the Inspection and Investigation Division of the Land Registration Authority (LRA), in his Report showing that her T.C.T. No. T-320601 was issued without legal basis and that no document was on file with the Primary Entry Book of the Registry of Deeds of Trece Martires City to support the issuance thereof. This Report concludes that petitioner's T.C.T. No. T-320601 is spurious. Such finding is reinforced by the NBI Report dated June 20, 1996 showing that the signature of Register of Deeds Antonia Cabuco appearing on petitioner's title is a forgery. Consequently, Atty. Artemio Cana, Acting Register of Deeds of Cavite, filed a complaint with the Regional Trial Court, Branch 89 at Bacoor for annulment of petitioner's title.
The rule that a title issued under the Torrens System is presumed valid and, hence, is the best proof of ownership of a piece of land does not apply where the certificate itself is faulty as to its purported origin.
In this case, petitioner anchors her arguments on the premise that her title to the subject property is indefeasible because of the presumption that her certificate of title is authentic. However, this presumption is overcome by the evidence presented, consisting of the LRA report dated May 24, 1996 that TCT No. T-320601 was issued without legal basis and the NBI report dated June 20, 1996 that the signature of Antonia Cabuco was a forgery. Although petitioner submitted documents purporting to show the genuineness of Antonia Cabuco's signature, she has not refuted the findings contained in the LRA report that her certificate of title has no legal basis. Thus, in its report, the LRA stated:
Verification conducted in the Registry of Deeds of Cavite Province on 21 May 1996 disclosed that there is no document on file in the registry vault to support the issuance of TCT No.T-320601 in favor of Amelita Dolfo. Even the Primary Entry Book for Act 496 under the date 18 November 1991 does not indicate that a document was presented for registration in favor of Amelita Dolfo affecting TCT No. 11520 which resulted in the issuance of TCT No. T-320601. Instead, page 232 of the Primary Entry Book, Volume 47 (Annex ""B"") shows that under the date - 18 November 1991 there appears no document entered therein at 11:05 a.m. in favor of Amelita Dolfo or in her behalf affecting the parcel of land described in TCT No. T-320601.
This Investigator also failed to locate despite the thorough search of the vault clerks, TCT No. 11520 the supposed title from whence the subject TCT No. T-320601 was derived. What are filed in the title volume are certificates of titles, including TCT No. T-11519 and TCT No. T-11521 both issued by RD Cuevas on 5 November 1964 at 9:00 a.m. (see Annexes ""C"" & ""C-1""). In other words, TCT No. 11520 was supposed to have been issued by RD Cuevas in November 1964. In the absence of the title, it cannot however be determined if TCT No. T-11520 covers the same parcel of land in the subject title of Amelita Dolfo.
Records of this Authority show that Judicial Forms 109 and 109-D (CB printed) with Serial No. 2061717 were requisitioned by and issued to Cavite Registry of Deeds on 21 October 1991. There appears no report of consumption pertaining to those title-forms was submitted by the Cavite Registry of Deeds (see Annexes ""D"" to ""D-5"").
On the other hand, records of the Cavite Registry of Deeds show that Judicial Forms 109-109-D with Serial No. 2061717 were consumed and used for a certificate and of title, TCT No. 322182, in favor of Manuel dela Cruz and not for issuance of TCT No. T-320601 in favor of Amelita Dolfo. This is confirmed by the Certification of Deputy Register of Deeds, dated 21 May 1996 (Annex ""E""), which attests:
This is to certify that as per records on file in the issuance book dated October 25, 1991, Judicial Form 109-109-D with Serial No. 2061717 was issued to Manuel dela Cruz with corresponding TCT No. 322182 and not TCT No. T-320601 in favor of Amelita Dolfo.
It is, however, also unfortunate that TCT No. 322182 (with Serial No. 2061717) and the certificate of title with Serial No. 2061716 are not also filed in the corresponding title (book) volume. What are filed therein are certificates of title, including TCT No. T-322180 (with Serial No. 2061715) and TCT No. T-322183 (with Serial No. 2061718) both issued by RD Cabuco on 8 August 1993 and 25 October 1991, respectively (see Annexes ""F"" & ""F-1"").
The Issuance Book of title-forms on file in the Cavite RD, particularly page 134 (Annex ""G""), also confirms that Judicial Form 2061717 was issued or released for TCT No. 322182 and not for TCT No. T-320601.
Furthermore, registry records show, particularly the same Issuance Book of title-forms, page 88 (Annex ""H""), that the Judicial Forms 109 and 109-D used for the genuine TCT No. 320601 were with Serial No. 2037534 (erroneously typed in the certification as 2037519); and that the said TCT No. 320601 was issued in the name of Molino Homes and not in favor of Amelita Dolfo. This is confirmed by the Certification of DRD Diosdado A. Concepcion, dated 21 May 1996, which states (Annex ""H-1""):
This is to certify that as per records on file in this registry, dated October 8, 1991 Judicial Form 109-109-D with Serial Number 2037519 TCT No. 320601 Book No. 1701 Page 101 issued in the name of Molino Homes and was received by Amania Jimenez.
When interviewed, DRD Concepcion disclosed to this Investigator that the supposed original of TCT No. T-320601 in the name of Amelita Dolfo is detached from the title volume. He could not tell where it is now, not even the vault clerks of the registry. However, Atty. Concepcion surmised that the same is in the possession/custody of Ms. Melany Victoria, OIC Deputy Registry of Deeds. Atty. Concepcion furnished this Investigator a certified copy (of a xerox copy in his file) of the subject TCT No. T-320601 (see Annex ""I""). He further intimated that based on his own personal verification he believes that the supposed title in the name of Amelita Dolfo is of doubtful authenticity. In fact, Atty. Concepcion further averred, that former Register of Deeds Antonia Cabuco disowned the signature above the typewritten name ""Antonia B. Cabuco, Register of Deeds"" in the subject TCT No.T-320601.
In an effort to remove any doubt on the veracity of her certificate of title, petitioner questioned the credibility of Atty. Artemio Caña who filed an action for annulment of her title. However, her evidence to prove the genuineness of her certificate of title was the letter of the LRA Administrator, Reynaldo Maulit, who, in declaring the existence of TCT No. T-320601 in the vaults of the Register of Deeds of the Province of Cavite, referred to the letter-report of the same Atty. Artemio Caña dated April 30, 1996.
Thus, petitioner cannot invoke the indefeasibility of her certificate of title. It bears emphasis that the Torrens system does not create or vest title but only confirms and records one already existing and vested. Thus, while it may be true, as petitioner argues, that a land registration court has no jurisdiction over parcels of land already covered by a certificate of title, it is equally true that this rule applies only where there exists no serious controversy as to the authenticity of the certificate.
Fourth. Indeed, to allow petitioner to intervene in the LRC cases would not avoid multiplicity of suits in view of the case for annulment and cancellation of TCT No. T-320601 now pending before the Regional Trial Court, Branch 89, Bacoor, Cavite. It is premature for petitioner to intervene in the LRC cases because her certificate of title, supposedly her best proof of ownership over the property described therein, is questionable. Besides, inasmuch as the authenticity of her certificate of title is also being questioned in the LRC cases, the evidence that she will present to the prove the contrary would be the same evidence she will present in the case for annulment of title. At this point, where there is already a decree of registration issued in favor of private respondents, it is moot and academic to allow petitioner to participate in the LRC cases for the purpose of preventing possible double titling of property. As the trial court correctly stated, petitioner is not left without remedy even if she was not allowed to intervene. If it is shown that her certificate of title is genuine and that she is the true owner of the litigated property, the proceedings in the land registration cases would then be null and void because the trial court has no jurisdiction on the matter. Otherwise, she could sue for damages.
WHEREFORE, the petition is DENIED and the decision and the resolution of the Court of Appeals are AFFIRMED. Costs against petitioner.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Overthrow of Co-operation Based on Handicraft, and on the Division of Labour
   We have seen how machinery does away with co-operation based on handicrafts, and with manufacture based on the division of handicraft labour. An example of the first sort is the mowing-machine; it replaces co-operation between mowers. A striking example of the second kind, is the needle-making machine. According to Adam Smith, 10 men, in his day, made in co-operation, over 48,000 needles a-day. On the other hand, a single needle-machine makes 145,000 in a working-day of 11 hours. One woman or one girl superintends four such machines, and so produces near upon 600,000 needles in a day, and upwards of 3,000,000 in a week.  A single machine, when it takes the place of co-operation or of manufacture, may itself serve as the basis of an industry of a handicraft character. Still, such a return to handicrafts is but a transition to the factory system, which, as a rule, makes its appearance so soon as the human muscles are replaced, for the purpose of driving the machines, by a mechanical motive power, such as steam or water. Here and there, but in any case only for a time, an industry may be carried on, on a small scale, by means of mechanical power. This is effected by hiring steam-power, as is done in some of the Birmingham trades, or by the use of small caloric-engines, as in some branches of weaving.  In the Coventry silk weaving industry the experiment of “cottage factories” was tried. In the centre of a square surrounded by rows of cottages, an engine-house was built and the engine connected by shafts with the looms in the cottages. In all cases the power was hired at so much per loom. The rent was payable weekly, whether the looms worked or not. Each cottage held from 2 to 6 looms; some belonged to the weaver, some were bought on credit, some were hired. The struggle between these cottage factories and the factory proper, lasted over 12 years. It ended with the complete ruin of the 300 cottage factories.  Wherever the nature of the process did not involve production on a large scale, the new industries that have sprung up in the last few decades, such as envelope making, steel-pen making, &c., have, as a general rule, first passed through the handicraft stage, and then the manufacturing stage, as short phases of transition to the factory stage. The transition is very difficult in those cases where the production of the article by manufacture consists, not of a series of graduated processes, but of a great number of disconnected ones. This circumstance formed a great hindrance to the establishment of steel-pen factories. Nevertheless, about 15 years ago, a machine was invented that automatically performed 6 separate operations at once. The first steel-pens were supplied by the handicraft system, in the year 1820, at £7 4s. the gross; in 1830 they-were supplied by manufacture at 8s., and today the factory system supplies them to the trade at from 2 to 6d. the gross. 
      B. Reaction of the Factory System on Manufacture and Domestic Industries
   Along with the development of the factory system and of the revolution in agriculture that accompanies it, production in all the other branches of industry not only extends, but alters its character. The principle, carried out in the factory system, of analysing the process of production into its constituent phases, and of solving the problems thus proposed by the application of mechanics, of chemistry, and of the whole range of the natural sciences, becomes the determining principle everywhere. Hence, machinery squeezes itself into the manufacturing industries first for one detail process, then for another. Thus the solid crystal of their organisation, based on the old division of labour, becomes dissolved, and makes way for constant changes. Independently of this, a radical change takes place in the composition of the collective labourer, a change of the persons working in combination. In contrast with the manufacturing period, the division of labour is thenceforth based, wherever possible, on the employment of women, of children of all ages, and of unskilled labourers, in one word, on cheap labour, as it is characteristically called in England. This is the case not only with all production on a large scale, whether employing machinery or not, but also with the so-called domestic industry, whether carried on in the houses of the workpeople or in small workshops. This modern so-called domestic industry has nothing, except the name, in common with the old-fashioned domestic industry, the existence of which pre-supposes independent urban handicrafts, independent peasant farming, and above all, a dwelling-house for the labourer and his family. That old-fashioned industry has now been converted into an outside department of the factory, the manufactory, or the warehouse. Besides the factory operatives, the manufacturing workmen and the handicraftsman, whom it concentrates in large masses at one spot, and directly commands, capital also sets in motion, by means, of invisible threads, another army; that of the workers in the domestic industries, who dwell in the large towns and -are also scattered over the face of the country. An example: The shirt factory of Messrs. Tillie at Londonderry, which employs 1,000 operatives in the factory itself, and 9,000 people spread up and down the country and working in their own houses. 
   The exploitation of cheap and immature labour-power is carried out in a more shameless manner in modern Manufacture than in the factory proper. This is because the technical foundation of the factory system, namely, the substitution of machines for muscular power, and the light character of the labour, is almost entirely absent in Manufacture, and at the same time women and over-young children are subjected, in a most unconscionable way, to the influence of poisonous or injurious substances. This exploitation is more shameless in the so-called domestic industry than in manufactures, and that because the power of resistance in the labourers decreases with their dissemination; because a whole series of plundering parasites insinuate themselves between the employer and the workman; because a domestic industry has always to compete either with the factory system, or with manufacturing in the same branch of production; because poverty robs the workman of the conditions most essential to his labour, of space, light and ventilation; because employment becomes more and more irregular; and, finally, because in these the last resorts of the masses made “redundant” by modern industry and Agriculture, competition for work attains its maximum. Economy in the means of production, first systematically carried out in the factory system, and there, from the very beginning, coincident with the most reckless squandering of labour-power, and robbery of the conditions normally requisite for labour   this economy now shows its antagonistic and murderous side more and more in a given branch of industry, the less the social productive power of labour and the technical basis for a combination of processes are developed in that branch.
   C. Modern Manufacture
   I now proceed, by a few examples, to illustrate the principles laid down above. As a matter of fact, the reader is already familiar with numerous instances given in the chapter on the working-day. In the hardware manufactures of Birmingham and the neighbourhood, there are employed, mostly in very heavy work, 30,000 children and young persons, besides 10,000 women. There they are to be seen in the unwholesome brass-foundries, button factories, enamelling, galvanising, and lackering works.  Owing to the excessive labour of their workpeople, both adult and non-adult, certain London houses where newspapers and books are printed, have got the ill-omened name of “slaughterhouses.”  Similar excesses are practised in book-binding, where the victims are chiefly women, girls, and children; young persons have to do heavy work in rope-walks and night-work in salt mines, candle manufactories, and chemical works; young people are worked to death at turning the looms in silk weaving, when it is not carried on by machinery.  One of the most shameful, the most dirty, and the worst paid kinds of labour, and one on which women and young girls are by preference employed, is the sorting of rags. It is well known that Great Britain, apart from its own immense store of rags, is the emporium for the rag trade of the whole world. They flow in from Japan, from the most remote States of South America, and from the Canary Islands. But the chief sources of their supply are Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Egypt, Turkey, Belgium, and Holland. They are used for manure, for making bedflocks, for shoddy, and they serve as the raw material of paper. The rag-sorters are the medium for the spread of small-pox and other infectious diseases, and they themselves are the first victims.  A classical example of over-work, of hard and inappropriate labour, and of its brutalising effects on the workman from his childhood upwards, is afforded not only by coal-mining and miners generally, but also by tile and brick making, in which industry the recently invented machinery is, in England, used only here and there. Between May and September the work lasts from 5 in the morning till 8 in the evening, and where the drying is done in the open air, it often lasts from 4 in the morning till 9 in the evening. Work from 5 in the morning till 7 in the evening is considered “reduced” and “moderate.” Both boys and girls of 6 and even of 4 years of age are employed. They work for the same number of hours, often longer, than the adults. The work is hard and the summer heat increases the exhaustion. In a certain tile-field at Mosley, e.g., a young woman, 24 years of age, was in the habit of making 2,000 tiles a day, with the assistance of 2 little girls, who carried the clay for her, and stacked the tiles. These girls carried daily 10 tons up the slippery sides of the clay pits, from a depth of 30 feet, and then for a distance of 210 feet.
“It is impossible for a child to pass through the purgatory of a tile-field without great moral degradation... the low language, which they are accustomed to hear from their tenderest years, the filthy, indecent, and shameless habits, amidst which, unknowing, and half wild, they grow up, make them in after-life lawless, abandoned, dissolute.... A frightful source of demoralisation is the mode of living. Each moulder, who is always a skilled labourer, and the chief of a group, supplies his 7 subordinates with board and lodging in his cottages Whether members of his family or not, the men, boys, and girls all sleep in the cottage, which contains generally two, exceptionally 3 rooms, all on the ground floor, and badly ventilated. These people are so exhausted after the day’s hard work, that neither the rules of health, of cleanliness, nor of decency are in the least observed. Many of these cottages are models of untidiness, dirt, and dust.... The greatest evil of the system that employs young girls on this sort of work, consists in this, that, as a rule, it chains them fast from childhood for the whole of their after-life to the most abandoned rabble. They become rough, foul-mouthed boys, before Nature has taught them that they are women. Clothed in a few dirty rags, the legs naked far above the knees, hair and face besmeared with dirt, they learn to treat all feelings of decency and of shame with contempt. During meal-times they lie at full length in the fields, or watch the boys bathing in a neighbouring canal. Their heavy day’s work at length completed, they put on better clothes, and accompany the men to the public houses.”
   That excessive insobriety is prevalent from childhood upwards among the whole of this class, is only natural.
“The worst is that the brickmakers despair of themselves. You might as well, said one of the better kind to a chaplain of Southallfield, try to raise and improve the devil as a brickie, sir!” 
   As to the manner, in which capital effects an economy in the requisites of labour, in modern Manufacture (in which I include all workshops of larger size, except factories proper), official and most ample material bearing on it is to be found in the Public Health Reports IV. (1863) and VI. (1864). The description of the Workshops, more especially those of the London printers and tailors, surpasses the most loathsome phantasies of our romance writers- The effect on the health of the workpeople is self-evident. Dr. Simon, the chief medical officer of the Privy Council and the official editor of the “Public Health Reports,” says:
“In my fourth Report (1863) I showed, how it is practically impossible for the workpeople to insist upon that which is their first sanitary right, viz., the right that, no matter what the work for which their employer brings them together, the labour, so far as it depends upon him, should be freed from all avoidably unwholesome conditions. I pointed out, that while the workpeople are practically incapable of doing themselves this sanitary justice, they are unable to obtain any effective support from the paid administrations of the sanitary police.... The life of myriads of workmen and workwomen is now uselessly tortured and shortened by the never-ending physical suffering that their mere occupation begets.” 
   In illustration of the way in which the workrooms influence the state of health Dr. Simon gives the following table of mortality.    D. Modern Domestic Industry
   I now come to the so-called domestic industry. In order to get an idea of the horrors of this sphere, in which capital conducts its exploitation in the background of modern mechanical industry, one must go to the apparently quite idyllic trade of nail-making,  carried on in a few remote villages of England. In this place, however, it will be enough to give a few examples from those branches of the lace-making and straw-plaiting industries that are not yet carried on by the aid of machinery, and that as yet do not compete with branches carried on in factories or in manufactories.
   Of the 150,000 persons employed in England in the production of lace, about 10,000 fall under the authority of the Factory Act, 1861. Almost the whole of the remaining 140,000 are women, young persons, and children of both sexes, the male sex, however, being weakly represented. The state of health of this cheap material for exploitation will be seen from the following table, computed by Dr. Trueman, physician to the Nottingham General Dispensary. Out of 686 female patients who were lace-makers, most of them between the ages of 17 and 24, the number of consumptive ones were:
                                 1852. — 1 in 45.	1857. — 1 in 13.
                                 1853. — 1 in 28.	1858. — 1 in 15.
                                 1854. — 1 in 17.	1859. — 1 in 9.
                                 1856. — 1 in 15.	1861. — 1 in 8. 
   This progress in the rate of consumption ought to suffice for the most optimist of progressists, and for the biggest hawker of lies among the Free-trade bagmen of Germany.
   The Factory Act of 1861 regulates the actual making of the lace, so far as it is done by machinery, and this is the rule in England. The branches that we are now about to examine, solely with regard to those of the workpeople who work at home, and not those who work in manufactories or warehouses, fall into two divisions, viz. (1), finishing; (2), mending. The former gives the finishing touches to the machine-made lace, and includes numerous sub-divisions.
   The lace finishing is done either in what are called “mistresses’ houses,” or by women in their own houses, with or without the help of their children. The women who keep the “mistresses’ houses” are themselves poor. The workroom is in a private house. The mistresses take orders from manufacturers, or from warehousemen, and employ as many women, girls, and young children as the size of their rooms and the fluctuating demand of the business will allow. The number of the workwomen employed in these workrooms varies from 20 to 40 in some, and from 10 to 20 in others. The average age at which the children commence work is six years, but in many cases it is below five. The usual working-hours are from 8 in the morning till eight in the evening, with 1½ hours for meals, which are taken at irregular intervals, and often in the foul workrooms. When business is brisk, the labour frequently lasts from 8 or even 6 o’clock in the morning till 10, 11, or 12 o’clock at night. In English barracks the regulation space allotted to each soldier is 500-600 cubic feet, and in the military hospitals 1,200 cubic feet. But in those finishing sties there are but 67 to 100 cubic feet to each person. At the same time the oxygen of the air is consumed by gas-lights. In order to keep the lace clean, and although the floor is tiled or gagged, the children are often compelled, even in winter, to pull off their shoes.
“It is not at all uncommon in Nottingham to find 14 to 20 children huddled together in a small room, of, perhaps, not more than 12 feet square, and employed for 15 hours out of the 24, at work that of itself is exhausting, from its weariness and monotony, and is besides carried on under every possible unwholesome condition.... Even the very youngest children work with a strained attention and a rapidity that is astonishing, hardly ever giving their fingers rest or glowering their motion. If a question be asked them, they never raise their eyes from their work from fear of losing a single moment.”
   The “long stick” is used by the mistresses as a stimulant more and more as the working hours are prolonged.
“The children gradually tire and become as restless as birds towards the end of their long detention at an occupation that is monotonous, eye-straining, and exhausting from the uniformity in the posture of the body. Their work is like slavery.” 
When women and their children work at home, which now-a-days means in a hired room, often in a garret, the state of things is, if possible, still worse. This sort of work is given out within a circle of 80 miles radius from Nottingham. On leaving the warehouses at 9 or 10 o’clock at night, the children are often given a bundle of lace to take home with them and finish. The Pharisee of a capitalist represented by one of his servants, accompanies this action, of course, with the unctuous phrase: “That’s for mother,” yet he knows well enough that the poor children must sit up and help. 
   Pillow lace-making is chiefly carried on in England in two agricultural districts; one, the Honiton lace district, extending from 20 to 30 miles along the south coast of Devonshire, and including a few places in North Devon; the other comprising a great part of the counties of Buckingham, Bedford, and Northampton, and also the adjoining portions of Oxfordshire and Huntingdonshire. The cottages of the agricultural labourers are the places where the work is usually carried on. Many manufacturers employ upwards of 3,000 of these lace-makers, who are chiefly children and young persons of the female sex exclusively. The state of things described as incidental to lace finishing is here repeated, save that instead of the “mistresses’ houses,” we find what are called “lace-schools,” kept by poor women in their cottages. From their fifth year and often earlier, until their twelfth or fifteenth year, the children work in these schools; during the first year the very young ones work from four to eight hours, and later on, from six in the morning till eight and ten o’clock at night.
“The rooms are generally the ordinary living rooms of small cottages, the chimney stopped up to keep out draughts, the inmates kept warm by their own animal heat alone, and this frequently in winter. In other cases, these so-called school-rooms are like small store-rooms without fire-places.... The over-crowding in these dens and the consequent vitiation of the air are often extreme. Added to this is the injurious effect of drains, privies, decomposing substances, and other filth usual in the purlieus of the smaller cottages.” With regard to space: “In one lace-school 18 girls and a mistress, 35 cubic feet to each person; in another, where the smell was unbearable, 18 persons and 24½ cubic feet per head. In this industry are to be found employed children of 2 and 2½ years.” 
   Where lace-making ends in the counties of Buckingham and Bedford, straw-plaiting begins, and extends over a large part of Hertfordshire and the westerly and northerly parts of Essex. In 1861, there were 40,043 persons employed in straw-plaiting and straw-hat making; of these 3,815 were males of all ages, the rest females, of whom 14,913, including about 7,000 children, were under 20 years of age. In the place of the lace-schools we find here the “straw-plait schools.” The children commence their instruction in straw-plaiting generally in their 4th, often between their 3rd and 4th year. Education, of course, they get none. The children themselves call the elementary schools, “natural schools,” to distinguish them from these blood-sucking institutions, in which they are kept at work simply to get through the task, generally 30 yards daily, prescribed by their half-starved mothers. These same mothers often make them work at home, after school is over, till 10, 11, and 12 o’clock at night. The straw cuts their mouths, with which they constantly moisten it, and their fingers. Dr. Ballard gives it as the general opinion of the whole body of medical officers in London, that 300 cubic feet is the minimum space proper for each person in a bedroom or workroom. But in the straw-plait schools space is more sparingly allotted than in the lace-schools, “12 2/3, 17, 18½ and below 22 cubic feet for each person.”
“The smaller of these numbers, says one of the commissioners, Mr. White, represents less space than the half of what a child would occupy if packed in a box measuring 3 feet in each direction.”
   Thus do the children enjoy life till the age of 12 or 14. The wretched half-starved parents think of nothing but getting as much as possible out of their children. The latter, as soon as they are grown up, do not care a farthing, and naturally so, for their parents, and leave them.
“It is no wonder that ignorance and vice abound in a population so brought up.... Their morality is at the lowest ebb,... a great number of the women have illegitimate children, and that at such an immature age that even those most conversant with criminal statistics are astounded.” 
   And the native land of these model families is the pattern Christian country for Europe; so says at least Count Montalembert, certainly a competent authority on Christianity!
   Wages in the above industries, miserable as they are (the maximum wages of a child in the straw-plait schools rising in rare cases to 3 shillings), are reduced far below their nominal amount by the prevalence of the truck system everywhere, but especially in the lace districts. 
   E. Passage of Modern Manufacture, an Domestic Industry into Modern Mechanical Industry. The Hastening of This Revolution by the Application of the Factory Acts to those Industries
   The cheapening of labour-power, by sheer abuse of the labour of women and children, by sheer robbery of every normal condition requisite for working and living, and by the sheer brutality of overwork and night-work, meets at last with natural obstacles that cannot be overstepped. So also, when based on these methods, do the cheapening of commodities and capitalist exploitation in general. So soon as this point is at last reached   and it takes many years   the hour has struck for the introduction of machinery, and for the thenceforth rapid conversion of the scattered domestic industries and also of manufactures into factory industries.
   An example, on the most colossal scale, of this movement is afforded by the production of wearing apparel. This industry, according to the classification of the Children’s Employment Commission, comprises straw-hat makers, ladies’-hat makers, cap-makers, tailors, milliners and dressmakers, shirt-makers, corset-makers, glove-makers, shoemakers, besides many minor branches, such as the making of neck-ties, collars, &c. In 1861, the number of females employed in these industries, in England and Wales, amounted to 586,299, of these 115,242 at the least were under 20, and 16,650. under 15 years of age. The number of these workwomen in the United Kingdom in 1861, was 750,334. The number of males employed in England and Wales, in hat-making, shoemaking, glove-making and tailoring was 437,969; of these 14,964 under 15 years, 89,285 between 15 and 20, and 333,117 over 20 years. Many of the smaller branches are not included in these figures. But take the figures as they stand; we then have for England and Wales alone, according to the census of 1861, a total of 1,024,277 persons, about as many as are absorbed by agriculture and cattle breeding. We begin to understand what becomes of the immense quantities of goods conjured up by the magic of machinery, and of the enormous masses of workpeople, which that machinery sets free.
   The production of wearing apparel is carried on partly in manufactories in whose workrooms there is but a reproduction of that division of labour, the membra disjecta of which were found ready to hand; partly by small master-handicraftsmen; these, however, do not, as formerly, work for individual consumers, but for manufactories and warehouses, and to such an extent that often whole towns and stretches of country carry on certain branches, such as shoemaking, as a speciality; finally, on a very great scale by the so-called domestic workers, who form an external department of the manufactories, warehouses, and even of the workshops of the smaller masters. 
   The raw material, &c., is supplied by mechanical industry, the mass of cheap human material (taillable à merci et miséricorde) is composed of the individuals “liberated” by mechanical industry and improved agriculture. The manufactures of this class owed their origin chiefly to the capitalist’s need of having at hand an army ready equipped to meet any increase of demand.  These manufactures, nevertheless, allowed the scattered handicrafts and domestic industries to continue to exist as a broad foundation. The great production of surplus-value in these branches of labour, and the progressive cheapening of their articles, were and are chiefly due to the minimum wages paid, no more than requisite for a miserable vegetation, and to the extension of working-time up to the maximum endurable by the human organism. It was in fact by the cheapness of the human sweat and the human blood, which were converted into commodities, that the markets were constantly being extended, and continue daily to be extended; more especially was this the case with England’s colonial markets, where, besides, English tastes and habits prevail. At last the critical point was reached. The basis of the old method, sheer brutality in the exploitation of the workpeople, accompanied more or less by a systematic division of labour, no longer sufficed for the extending markets and for the still more rapidly extending competition of the capitalists. The hour struck for the advent of machinery. The decisively revolutionary machine, the machine which attacks in an equal degree the whole of the numberless branches of this sphere of production, dressmaking, tailoring, shoemaking, sewing, hat-making, and many others, is the sewing-machine.
   Its immediate effect on the workpeople is like that of all machinery, which, since the rise of modern industry, has seized upon new branches of trade. Children of too tender an age are sent adrift. The wage of the machine hands rises compared with that of the house-workers, many of whom belong to the poorest of the poor. That of the better situated handicraftsman, with whom the machine competes, sinks. The new machine hands are exclusively girls and young women. With the help of mechanical force, they destroy the monopoly that male labour had of the heavier work, and they drive off from the lighter work numbers of old women and very young children. The overpowering competition crushes the weakest of the manual labourers. The fearful increase in death from starvation during the last 10 years in London runs parallel with the extension of machine sewing.  The new workwomen turn the machines by hand and foot, or by hand alone, sometimes sitting, sometimes standing, according to the weight, size, and special make of the machine, and expend a great deal of labour-power. Their occupation is unwholesome, owing to the long hours, although in most cases they are not so long as under the old system. Wherever the sewing-machine locates itself in narrow and already over-crowded workrooms, it adds to the unwholesome influences.
“The effect,” says Mr. Lord, “on entering low-ceiled workrooms in which 30 to 40 machine hands are working is unbearable.... The heat, partly due to the gas stoves used for warming the irons, is horrible.... Even when moderate hours of work, i.e., from 8 in the morning till 6 in the evening, prevail in such places, yet 3 or 4 persons fall into a swoon regularly every day.” 
   The revolution in the industrial methods which is the necessary result of the revolution in the instruments of production, is effected by a medley of transition forms. These forms vary according to the extent to which the sewing-machine has become prevalent in one branch, of industry or the other, to the time during which it has been in operation, to the previous condition of the workpeople, to the preponderance of manufacture, of handicrafts or of domestic industry, to the rent of the workrooms,  &c. In dressmaking, for instance, where the labour for the most part was already organised, chiefly by simple co-operation, the sewing-machine at first formed merely a new factor in that manufacturing industry. In tailoring, shirtmaking, shoemaking, &c., all the forms are intermingled. Here the factory system proper. There middlemen receive the raw material from the capitalist en chef, and group around their sewing-machines, in “chambers” and “garrets,” from 10 to 50 or more workwomen. Finally, as is always the case with machinery when not organised into a system, and when it can also be used in dwarfish proportions, handicraftsman and domestic workers, along with their families, or with a little extra labour from without, make use of their own sewing-machines.  The system actually prevalent in England is, that the capitalist concentrates a large number of machines on his premises, and then distributes the produce of those machines for further manipulation amongst the domestic workers.  The variety of the transition forms, however, does not conceal the tendency to conversion into the factory system proper. This tendency is nurtured by the very nature of the sewing-machine, the manifold uses of which push on the concentration, under one roof, and one management, of previously separated branches of a trade. It is also favoured by the circumstance that preparatory needlework, and certain other operations, are most conveniently done on the premises where the machine is at work; as well as by the inevitable expropriation of the hand sewers, and of the domestic workers who work with their own machines. This fate has already in part overtaken them. The constantly increasing amount of capital invested in sewing-machines,  gives the spur to the production of, and gluts the markets with, machine-made articles, thereby giving the signal to the domestic workers for the sale of their machines. The overproduction of sewing-machines themselves, causes their producers, in bad want of a sale, to let them out for so much a week, thus crushing by their deadly competition the small owners of machines.  Constant changes in the construction of the machines, and their ever-increasing cheapness, depreciate day by day the older makes, and allow of their being sold in great numbers, at absurd prices, to large capitalists, who alone can thus employ them at a profit. Finally, the substitution of the steam-engine for man gives in this, as in all similar revolutions, the finishing blow. At first, the use of steam power meets with mere technical difficulties, such as unsteadiness in the machines, difficulty in controlling their speed, rapid wear and tear of the lighter machines, &c., all of which are soon overcome by experience.  If, on the one hand, the concentration of many machines in large manufactories leads to the use of steam power, on the other hand, the competition of steam with human muscles hastens on the concentration of workpeople and machines in large factories. Thus England is at present experiencing, not only in the colossal industry of making wearing apparel, but in most of the other trades mentioned above, the conversion of manufacture, of handicrafts, and of domestic work into the factory system, after each of those forms of production, totally changed and disorganised. under the Influence of modern industry, has long ago reproduced, and even overdone, all the horrors of the factory system, without participating in any of the elements of social progress it contains. 
This industrial revolution which takes place spontaneously, is artificially helped on by the extension of the Factory Acts to all industries in which women, young persons and children are employed. The compulsory regulation of the working-day as regards its length, pauses, beginning and end, the system of relays of children, the exclusion of all children under a certain age, &c., necessitate on the one hand more machinery  and the substitution of steam as a motive power in the place of muscles.  On the other hand, in order to make up for the loss of time, an expansion occurs of the means of production used in common, of the furnaces, buildings, &c., in one word, greater concentration of the means of production and a correspondingly greater concourse of workpeople. The chief objection, repeatedly and passionately urged on behalf of each manufacture threatened with the Factory Act, is in fact this, that in order to continue the business on the old scale a greater outlay of capital will be necessary. But as regards labour in the so-called domestic industries and the intermediate forms between them and Manufacture, so soon as limits are put to the working-day and to the employment of children, those industries go to the wall. Unlimited exploitation of cheap labour-power is the sole foundation of their power to compete.
   One of the essential conditions for the existence of the factory system, especially when the length of the working-day is fixed, is certainty in the result, i.e., the production in a given time of a given quantity of commodities, or of a given useful effect. The statutory pauses in the working-day, moreover, imply the assumption that periodical and sudden cessation of the work does no harm to the article undergoing the process of production. This certainty in the result, and this possibility of interrupting the work are, of course, easier to be attained in the purely mechanical industries than in those in which chemical and physical processes play a part; as, for instance, in the earthenware trade, in bleaching, dyeing, baking, and in most of the metal industries. Wherever there is a workingday without restriction as to length, wherever there is night-work and unrestricted waste of human life, there the slightest obstacle presented by the nature of the work to a change for the better is soon looked upon as an everlasting barrier erected by Nature. No poison kills vermin with more certainty than the Factory Act removes such everlasting barriers. No one made a greater outcry over “impossibilities” than our friends the earthenware manufacturers. In 1864, however, they were brought under the Act, and within sixteen months every “impossibility” had vanished.
“The improved method,” called forth by the Act, “of making slip by pressure instead of by evaporation, the newly-constructed stoves for drying the ware in its green state, &c., are each events of great importance in the pottery art, and mark an advance which the preceding century could not rival.... It has even considerably reduced the temperature of the stoves themselves with a considerable saving of fuel, and with a readier effect on the ware.” 
   In spite of every prophecy, the cost-price of earthenware did not rise, but the quantity produced did, and to such an extent that the export for the twelve months, ending December, 1865, exceeded in value by £138,628 the average of the preceding three years. In the manufacture of matches it was thought to be an indispensable requirement, that boys, even while bolting their dinner, should go on dipping the matches in melted phosphorus, the poisonous vapour from which rose into their faces. The Factory Act (1864) made the saving of time a necessity, and so forced into existence a dipping machine, the vapour from which could not come in contact with the workers.  So, at the present time, in those branches of the lace manufacture not yet subject to the Factory Act, it is maintained that the meal-times cannot be regular owing to the different periods required by the various kinds of lace for drying, which periods vary from three minutes up to an hour and more. To this the Children’s Employment Commissioners answer:
“The circumstances of this case are precisely analogous to that of the paper-stainers, dealt with in our first report. Some of the principal manufacturers in the trade urged that in consequence of the nature of the materials used, and their various processes, they would be unable, without serious loss, to stop for meal-times at any given moment. But it was seen from the evidence that, by due care and previous arrangement, the apprehended difficulty would be got over; and accordingly, by clause 6 of section 6 of the Factory Acts Extension Act, passed during this Session of Parliament, an interval of eighteen months is given to them from the passing of the Act before they are required to conform to the meal hours, specified by the Factory Acts.” 
   Hardly had the Act been passed when our friends the manufacturers found out:
“The inconveniences we expected to arise from the introduction of the Factory Acts into our branch of manufacture, I am happy to say, have not arisen. We do not find the production at all interfered with; in short, we produce more in the same time.” 
   It is evident that the English legislature, which certainly no one will venture to reproach with being overdosed with genius, has been led by experience to the conclusion that a simple compulsory law is sufficient to enact away all the so-called impediments, opposed by the nature of the process, to the restriction and regulation of the working-day. Hence, on the introduction of the Factory Act into a given industry, a period varying from six to eighteen months is fixed within which it is incumbent on the manufacturers to remove all technical impediments to the working of the Act. Mirabeau’s “Impossible! ne me dites jamais ce bête de mot!” is particularly applicable to modern technology. But though the Factory Acts thus artificially ripen the material elements necessary for the conversion of the manufacturing system into the factory system, yet at the same time, owing to the necessity they impose for greater outlay of capital, they hasten on the decline of the small masters, and the concentration of capital. 
   Besides the purely technical impediments that are removable by technical means, the irregular habits of the workpeople themselves obstruct the regulation of the hours of labour. This is especially the case where piece-wage predominates, and where loss of time in one part of the day or week can be made good by subsequent over-time, or by night-work, a process which brutalises the adult workman, and ruins his wife and children.  Although this absence of regularity in the expenditure of labour-power is a natural and rude reaction against the tedium of monotonous drudgery, it originates, also, to a much greater degree from anarchy in production, anarchy that in its turn pre-supposes unbridled exploitation of labour-power by the capitalist. Besides the general periodic changes of the industrial cycle, and the special fluctuations in the markets to which each industry is subject, we may also reckon what is called “the season,” dependent either on the periodicity of favourable seasons of the year for navigation; or on fashion, and the sudden placing of large orders that have to be executed in the shortest possible time. The habit of giving such orders becomes more frequent with the extension of railways and telegraphs.
“The extension of the railway system throughout the country has tended very much to encourage giving short notice. Purchasers now come up from Glasgow, Manchester, and Edinburgh once every fortnight or so to the wholesale city warehouses which we supply, and give small orders requiring immediate execution, instead of buying from stock as they used to do. Years ago we were always able to work in the slack times, so as to meet demand of the next season, but now no one can say beforehand what will be the demand then.” 
   In those factories and manufactories that are not yet subject to the Factory Acts, the most fearful over-work prevails periodically during what is called the season, in consequence of sudden orders. In the outside department of the factory, of the manufactory, and of the warehouse, the so-called domestic workers, whose employment is at the best irregular, are entirely dependent for their raw material and their orders on the caprice of the capitalist, who, in this industry, is not hampered by any regard for depreciation of his buildings and machinery, and risks nothing by a stoppage of work, but the skin of the worker himself. Here then he sets himself systematically to work to form an industrial reserve force that shall be ready at a moment’s notice; during one part of the year he decimates this force by the most inhuman toil, during the other part, he lets it starve for want of work.
“The employers avail themselves of the habitual irregularity in the homework, when any extra work is wanted at a push, so that the work goes on till 11, and 12 p.m. or 2 a.m., or as the usual phrase is, “all hours,” and that in localities where “the stench is enough to knock you down, you go to the door, perhaps, and open it, but shudder to go further.”  “They are curious men,” said one of the witnesses, a shoemaker, speaking of the masters, “they think it does a boy no harm to work too hard for half the year, if he is nearly idle for the other half.” 
   In the same way as technical impediments, so, too, those “usages which have grown with the growth of trade” were and still are proclaimed by interested capitalists as obstacles due to the nature of the work. This was a favourite cry of the cotton lords at the time they were first threatened with the Factory Acts. Although their industry more than any other depends on navigation, yet experience has given them the lie. Since then, every pretended obstruction to business has been treated by the Factory inspectors as a mere sham.  The thoroughly conscientious investigations of the Children’s Employment Commission prove that the effect of the regulation of the hours of work, in some industries, was to spread the mass of labour previously employed more evenly over the whole year  that this regulation was the first rational bridle on the murderous, meaningless caprices of fashion,  caprices that consort so badly with the system of modern industry; that the development of ocean navigation and of the means of communication generally, has swept away the technical basis on which season-work was really supported,  and that all other so-called unconquerable difficulties vanish before larger buildings, additional machinery, increase in the number of workpeople employed,  and the alterations caused by all these in the mode of conducting the wholesale trade.  But for all that, capital never becomes reconciled to such changes   and this is admitted over and over again by its own representatives   except “under the pressure of a General Act of Parliament”  for the compulsory regulation of the hours of labour.

187. Mr. White, a commissioner, visited a military clothing manufactory that employed 1,000 to 1,200 persons, almost all females, and a shoe manufactory with 1,300 persons; of these nearly one half were children and young persons.

The concluding statement in this quotation refers exclusively to shoemaking.

At the date of the Child. Empl. Comm. of 1840 stocking making was still done by manual labour. Since 1846 various sorts of machines have been introduced, which are now driven by steam. The total number of persons of both sexes and of all ages from 3 years upwards, employed in stocking making in England, was in 1862 about 129,000. Of these only 4,063 were, according to the Parliamentary Return of the 11th February, 1862, working under the Factory Acts.
197. Thus, e.g., in the earthenware trade, Messrs. Cochrane, of the Britain Pottery, Glasgow, report: “To keep up our quantity we have gone extensively into machines wrought by unskilled labour, and every day convinces us that we can produce a greater quantity than by the old method.” (“Rep. of Insp. of Fact., 31st Oct., 1865,” p. 13.) “The effect of the Fact. Acts is to force on the further introduction of machinery” (l.c., pp. 13-14).

200. The introduction of this and other machinery into match-making caused in one department alone 230 young persons to be replaced by 32 boys and girls of 14 to 17 years of age. This saving in labour was carried still further in 1865, by the employment of steam power.

203. “But it must be borne in mind that those improvements, though carried out fully in some establishments, are by no means general, and are not capable of being brought into use in many of the old manufactories without an expenditure of capital beyond the means of many of the present occupiers.” “I cannot but rejoice,” writes Sub-Insp. May, “that notwithstanding the temporary disorganisation which inevitably follows the introduction of such a measure (as the Factory Act Extension Act), and is, indeed, directly indicative of the evils which it was intended to remedy, &c.” (Rep. of Insp. of Fact., 31st Oct., 1865.)
204. With blast furnaces, for instance, “work towards the end of the week being generally much increased in duration in consequence of the habit of the men of idling on Monday and occasionally during a part or the whole of Tuesday also.” (“Child. Empl. Comm., III. Rep.,” p. vi.) “The little masters generally have very irregular hours. They lose two or three days, and then work all night to make it up.... They always employ their own children, if they have any.” (l.c., p. vii.) “The want of regularity in coming to work, encouraged by the possibility and practice of making up for this by working longer hours.” (l.c., p. xviii.) “In Birmingham ... an enormous amount of time is lost ... idling part of the time, slaving the rest.” (l.c., p. xi.)
205. “Child. Empl. Comm., IV., Rep.,” p. xxxii., “The extension of the railway system is said to have contributed greatly to this custom of giving sudden orders, and the consequent hurry, neglect of meal-times, and late hours of the workpeople.” (l.c., p. xxxi.)

208. With respect to the loss of trade by non-completion of shipping orders in time, I remember that this was the pet argument of the factory masters in 1832 and 1833. Nothing that can be advanced now on this subject, could have the force that it had then, before steam had halved all distances and established new regulations for transit. It quite failed at that time of proof when put to the test, and again it will certainly fail should it have to be tried.” (“Reports of Insp. of Fact., 31 Oct., 1862,” pp. 54, 55.)

208b. John Bellers remarked as far back as 1699: “The uncertainty of fashions does increase necessitous poor. It has two great mischiefs in it. 1st, The journeymen are miserable in winter for want of work, the mercers and master-weavers not daring to lay out their stocks to keep the journeymen employed before the spring comes, and they know what the fashion will then be; 2ndly, In the spring the journeymen are not sufficient, but the master-weavers must draw in many prentices, that they may supply the trade of the kingdom in a quarter or half a year, which robs the plough of hands, drains the country of labourers, and in a great part stocks the city with beggars, and starves some in winter that are ashamed to beg.” (“Essays about the Poor, Manufactures, &c.,” p. 9.)
209. “Ch. Empl. Comm. V. Rep.,” p. 171, n. 34.
210. The evidence of some Bradford export-houses is as follows: “Under these circumstances, it seems clear that no boys need be worked longer than from 8 a.m. to 7 or 7.30 p.m., in making up. It is merely a question of extra hands and extra outlay. If some masters were not so greedy, the boys would not work late; an extra machine costs only £16 or £18; much of such over-time as does occur is to be referred to an insufficiency of appliances, and a want of space.” “Ch. Empl, Comm. V. Rep.,” p. 171, n. 35, 36, 38.
211. l.c. A London manufacturer, who in other respects looks upon the compulsory regulation of the hours of labour as a protection for the workpeople against the manufacturers, and for the manufacturers themselves against the wholesale trade, states: “The pressure in our business is caused by the shippers, who want, e.g., to send the goods by sailing vessel so as to reach their destination at a given season, and at the same time want to pocket the difference in freight between a sailing vessel and a steamship, or who select the earlier of two steamships in order to be in the foreign market before their competitors.”
212. “This could be obviated,” says a manufacturer, “at the expense of an enlargement of the works under the pressure of a General Act of Parliament.” l.c., p. x., n. 38."

33,91056748,Milagro,Jason Dy,[15],['R&B/Soul'],"The elections of 1994 are described as a ""political earthquake,"" a ""triumph of conservatism"" that reflects the continuing ""drift to the right"" on the part of the American population. The victorious Gingrich army of well-trained, well-funded ""conservatives"" call for a Contract with America that will finally ""get government off our backs"" so that we can return to the happy days when the free market reigned. They will restore ""family values,"" ridding us of ""the excesses of the welfare state"" and the other residues of the failed ""big government"" policies of New Deal liberalism and Johnson's ""Great Society."" By dismantling the ""nanny state"" they will succeed, where the Democrats have failed, to achieve the shared goal of all elite and leadership elements: to ""create jobs for Americans"" and win security and freedom for the ""middle class."" And they will take over and successfully lead the crusade to establish the American Dream of free market democracy, worldwide.
One of the great achievements of contemporary ideological warfare has been to debase the terms of political discourse so thoroughly that such statements as these are not entirely false, if we keep to what has become conventional usage. As Orwell predicted, this achievement has undermined the possibility even of talking sensibly about what is happening in the world. Still, independent minds -- including any authentic conservatives who might be located in the outer reaches of the political arena or intellectual world -- can refuse to be swept up in the fashionable currents and use terms with their actual meanings to describe what is happening, and why.
1. The Triumph of Conservatism
Most of this, we also heard just ten years ago, when Reagan was elected by a 2-1 vote, the second ""conservative landslide"" in four years. In his 1980 triumph, presidential historian William Leuchtenberg observed, ""Reagan, far from having won in a landslide, got little more than a bare majority of the popular vote and only 28% of the potential electorate, and exit polls showed that the vote was not ""for Reagan"" but ""against Carter,"" who had in fact initiated the policies that the Reaganites took up and implemented, with the general support of congressional Democrats: accelerating military spending (meaning, in particular, the state sector of the economy) while cutting back programs that aid the vast majority. Polls in 1980 revealed that 11% of Reagan voters chose him because ""he's a real conservative"" -- whatever that term is supposed to mean.
In 1984, despite vast attempts to get out the vote, the totals increased by 1%. The percentage who chose Reagan because he was a ""real conservative"" dropped to 4%, while 70% of all voters with an opinion on the matter opposed Reaganite legislative programs, and public opinion studies showed a continuation of the steady drift towards a kind of New Deal-style welfare state liberalism on the part of the general population. Their concerns and desires were not articulated in the political system, however; one reason, surely, why voting was so sharply skewed towards privileged sectors.
The reasons why voting is so dramatically an elite affair in the United States are revealed by comparative studies. Analysis of thirty democracies showed ""a significant correlation between high voter turnout and the presence of political parties representing clearly defined strata of society -- that is, parties strongly tied to specific income classes, religious groupings, or language groups"" (political commentator Thomas Edsall, 1984). In economic policy, Edsall added, the U.S. political system fails to represent ""the interests of the bottom three-fifths of society."" To use a phrase that is unspeakable in polite society without shock quotes, when the ""class interests"" of the privileged and powerful are the guiding commitment of all political parties, people who do not share these interests tend to stay home. The class pattern of abstention ""seems inseparably linked to another crucial comparative peculiarity of the American political system,"" political scientist William Dean Burnham observed: ""the total absence of a socialist or laborite party as an organized competitor in the electoral market."" That absence relates to and is fortified by the effective dismantling of civil society: unions, political organizations, and so on.1
In the 1980s, the U.S. and Britain took the lead in the ""triumph of conservatism,"" accelerating processes already underway. They therefore lead the developed world in impoverishment and degradation, inequality, homelessness, destruction of family values, hunger, and other values of contemporary ""conservatism."" A study by the British charitable organization Action for Children, founded in 1869 with the Queen as patron, concludes that ""the gap between rich and poor is as wide today as it was in Victorian times,"" and in some ways worse. A million and a half families cannot afford to provide their children with ""the diet fed to a similar child living in a Bethnal Green Workhouse in 1876,"" a ""sad reflection on British society."" Britain has proportionately more children living in poverty than any European country apart from Portugal and Ireland, and the proportion is rising faster than any country in Europe, though the U.S. still holds the lead.
Britain has also not yet matched the achievements of the doctrinal system crafted by our highly class conscious business community, with the assistance of those whom the lively 19th century working class press called ""the bought priesthood"" of respectable intellectuals. The fact that there is ""class conflict"" and that the rich and powerful mobilize state power to serve their interests, a truism to Adam Smith, remains within popular consciousness. The 1994 Gallup Political and Economic Index gives interesting information about popular attitudes on these matters (I put aside small numbers, 3%-10%, expressing no opinion). The study reports that over four-fifths of the population think ""there is a class struggle in this country"" and that ""too little"" is being done ""to level up the classes."" Two-thirds ""disagree strongly"" with the statement ""Britain is a classless society."" Nine out of ten feel that the Government does ""too little"" for ""the working class,"" four-fifths that it does ""too much"" for ""the well-to-do,"" and over 90% that it does ""too little"" for ""people living on small pensions/income."" Half also think it does ""too little"" for ""the middle classes."" Three-fourths ""think of Britain as divided into haves and have-nots,"" and a third describe themselves as among ""the haves.""2
Let's return to 1994, the next in the series of ""conservative landslides,"" this time under the leadership of Newt Gingrich. ""Republicans claimed about 52 percent of all votes cast for candidates in contested House seats, slightly better than a two-point improvement from 1992"" (Richard Morin, director of polling for the Washington Post). One out of six voters described the outcome as ""an affirmation of the Republican agenda""; 60% said it ""was a repudiation of the Democrats."" A ""more conservative Congress"" was considered to be an issue by a rousing 12% of the voters. An ""overwhelming majority had never heard of"" the Gingrich Contract with America, articulating the Republican agenda, though a majority opposed one of its central components: ""defense increases,"" a code-word for public subsidies to advanced industry. The chief pollster of the Los Angeles Times pointed out that just before the election, 61% of those polled said ""that spending for domestic programs should be increased.""
All of this echoes the situation of a decade ago.
The opposition to Democrats is more nuanced. Clinton-style ""New Democrats"" -- in effect, moderate Republicans -- ""lost their seats at twice the rate of their more liberal colleagues,"" Ken Silverstein and Alexander Cockburn report. The ""more liberal"" Democrats are those who tried to activate the old Democratic coalition of working people, women, the poor: the majority of the population who see themselves, correctly, as effectively disenfranchised.
To put these figures in further perspective, it must be recalled that voting was even more heavily skewed towards the wealthy and privileged than before. As compared with 1992, 7% more voters were wealthy, 7% fewer were working class, political scientist Peter Levine comments, noting also that Democrats were overwhelmingly preferred by voters who earn less than $30,000 a year and ran even with Republicans in the $30,000-$49,000 range. There was also a very large gender and color gap, white males voting mostly Republican, while women, Blacks and Hispanics voted for Democrats (overwhelmingly, in the Black-Hispanic category, where participation was low). Those with no more than high school education, along with those with postgraduate education, favored Democrats. Those who sensed a decline in their standard of living voted for Republicans by close to two to one -- mostly white males with just high school degrees ""whose economic futures are highly uncertain,"" Thomas Edsall observes; just those who would have been part of a left-populist coalition committed to equitable economic growth and political democracy, were such an option to intrude into our business-run political system.
The message, however, was just the opposite: Clinton must abandon the left-wing agenda that the voters had just overwhelmingly rejected and return to what he had promised to be in 1992: a ""New Democrat."" And he was quick to pick up the cues. In a satellite address to the National League of cities, ""Clinton used some variation of the words `work,' `jobs' or `working families' more than 40 times as he raised `New Democrat' themes such as welfare reform, national service, lifelong job training, and the need to `attack problems that feed dependency',"" the Boston Globe reported under the headline: ""Clinton seen returning to `New Democrat' stance."" The report didn't say when he had left that stance for some different one, on any issue of importance to rich and powerful. If he had, Business Week hadn't noticed. ""Corporate America did fine riding in tandem with Clinton,"" the journal reports, though ""it did equally well when they diverged.""
Despite all his efforts to please, still business ""basically hates the Clinton Administration,"" Business Week continues, and gives him ""little credit"" for advancing the corporate agenda. Why? The reasons they give, and cite from polls of executives, are hard to take seriously. But there is one very good reason. Leading sectors of wealth and privilege taste blood. They think, with some reason, that they have the world's population by the throat, and are in a position to roll back the hated welfare state for the general population and everything that goes with it: health and safety standards, labor rights and human rights generally, indeed any infringement on their right to pursue ""the vile maxim,"" as Adam Smith described the goal of the masters: ""all for ourselves, and nothing for other people."" Given that awareness, it makes sense to ""hate"" anyone who may have a somewhat flawed commitment to the sole human value: ""Gain Wealth, forgetting all but Self,"" ""the New Spirit of the Age"" denounced by the lively and vigorous working class press 150 years ago, as working people fought to save human values from the rising tide of private tyranny.3
Yet another factor, scarcely noted here, has to be taken into account in evaluating the electoral results. Under the headline ""Big money still garners the big vote,"" George Graham observed in the London Financial Times that money ""spoke as loud as ever in the most expensive campaign on record."" With a few notable exceptions, electoral victory tracked campaign financing closely -- again, no departure from the norm and natural in a political system in which the less affluent majority does not participate and is scarcely represented.4
Voters selected ""welfare reform"" as their top priority, with health care reform second and crime also ranking high. These choices, which in part reflect a grasp of reality, also have to be understood against the background of recent propaganda offensives.
To begin with reality, for most of the population, conditions of life and work are grim and declining, something new in the history of industrial society. Median income declined even during the ""Clinton recovery,"" falling to 7% below the 1989 level by late 1993, the Census Bureau reported. The decline was accompanied by -- and in no small measure caused by -- much-lauded improvements in ""flexibility of labor markets."" The latter is a technical term referring to elimination of job security and other such ""market rigidities"" that interfere with ""economic health,"" another ideological construct. As designed for the purposes of population control, ""economic health"" is unrelated to the welfare of the population but crafted to measure what is valued by the rich: speculators, bond holders, investors, professionals who serve the state-corporate sector. Continuing the decline during the Reagan years, after a decade of stagnation, pay for private sector employees fell 4% from 1988 to 1994, with blue collar wages suffering most and white collar wages still below 1990 and well below 1988. Despite much misleading hype, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reports a continuing ""shift to lower-wage industries and higher wage-occupations,"" executive and professional, while noting that the overwhelming majority of these are in lower-paid service industries (motel manager, and the like). That means sharply increased inequality, with the majority suffering reductions in absolute terms along with much worse work conditions.5
But some folks are doing just fine. ""The percentage of corporate income devoted to payrolls is hovering near a record low,"" Fortune magazine reported in November, having dropped sharply during the ""conservative landslide"" of the early 1980s, and again since 1992. With the ""New Democrats"" at the helm, ""1993 was a bracingly upbeat year for the FORTUNE 500,"" the journal exulted in its April 1994 annual review of the state of the important people, who posted ""dazzling"" profits despite ""virtually stagnant"" sales growth. The ecstatic story was headed: ""Hats Off! It Was a Heck of a Year"" -- at least, for those who matter.6
While in part realistic, the expressed concerns of voters reflect the great victories of the ideological warfare that has been conducted with relentless intensity since the early 1970s in the effort to overcome the perceived ""crisis of democracy."" Across the political spectrum, privileged sectors were naturally appalled by the attempts of the great majority of the population to escape from the apathy and marginalization that is their proper place and to enter the political arena, forgetting that in a democracy the role of the ""ignorant and meddlesome outsiders"" is to be mere ""spectators,"" not ""participants,"" as Walter Lippmann put it in his progressive essays on democracy 70 years ago, expressing the doctrines of ""Wilsonian idealism."" It therefore became necessary to renew with much greater intensity the constant campaign to tame and cage that ""great beast,"" as Alexander Hamilton termed the ""people"" with horror and indignation as he was laying the foundations for state-guided industrial democracy. The beast may not yet be tamed, but it is being caged; sometimes quite literally, sometimes in chains of dogma and deceit, an important victory.
We may recall, in passing, that fear of democracy and freedom has always been one of the factors motivating the terror and sometimes outright aggression undertaken to eliminate ""rotten apples"" that might ""spoil the barrel"" and ""viruses"" that might ""infect others,"" in the terminology favored by leading planners -- the main concern, of course, being independence, whatever cast it takes. That helps explain the passion of Washington's terrorist wars in Central America in recent years, or to take a current example, Washington's not-so-tacit support for its trainees and associates in the Haitian military as they did their necessary work, and the restoration of the rule of their backers among the Haitian elite under the guise of ""democracy,"" now that the work is done and the Generals can be sent off to the life of luxury, which, they understood correctly, would be their reward for services rendered. Behind the supercilious racist rhetoric about ""civilizing Aristide"" and teaching him ""lessons in democracy"" lies a real fear: that the democratic virus in Haiti might even infect these shores. People here might realize that we have a great deal to learn about democracy from the peasants and slum-dwellers of Haiti, who constructed a vibrant civil society that offered the ""great beast"" a chance to take some control over their lives. Their crime brings to mind the call for freedom for all people that was sounded for the first time in Haiti two centuries ago, outraging the civilized opinion of that day.
One consequence of the huge propaganda campaigns of the past several decades is the mood of ""antipolitics"" reported in feature stories. Concealed from public view is the fact that ""politics is the shadow cast on society by big business,"" as John Dewey stated the truism familiar at least since Adam Smith, adding that as long as this is so, ""the attenuation of the shadow will not change the substance."" Reforms are of limited utility. Democracy requires that the source of the shadow be removed, not only because of its domination of the political arena, but because the very institutions of private power undermine democracy and freedom; again, an observation familar back to the Founding Fathers.
But the source of the shadow has to be driven from the mind. Naturally, this is a leading theme of the literature of the ultraright foundations that are seeking to drive the educational system and media towards an even narrower fringe of the permissible spectrum. At the other extreme, Clinton campaign literature spoke movingly about workers and their firms and how government must help them; missing from the picture were bosses, profits, investors, and the like. There are ""entrepreneurs,"" nice folk who appear now and then to help the workers and their firms. They then sink into the background along with the unmentionables, who are laboring for the common good, selflessly seeking to provide jobs and decent lives for ordinary people in the ""civil society"" in which all participate.7
The fanaticism of the effort to conceal the obvious has reached comic proportions. After the latest APEC summit in Jakarta in November, front-page headlines announced that ""Clinton Is Stern With Indonesia On Rights but Gleeful on Trade"" (New York Times). The ""sternness on rights"" consisted of a few whimpers denounced by Indonesian human rights activists and labor leaders (those still out of jail), but the Glee on Trade was real enough. It reflects the successes of ""the Administration's campaign of commercial diplomacy"" that ""will mean jobs for Americans,"" Times political correspondent Elaine Sciolino reported with admiration. Clinton firmed up $40 billion in joint projects in his campaign for ""jobs for Americans""; at least $35 billion, possibly more, was an arrangement between Exxon and the Indonesian state oil company Pertamina to develop an off-shore natural gas field, which could ""mean new jobs for US businesses that help set up wells and off-shore platforms,"" the Boston Globe reported. Exxon's Indonesia affiliate and Pertamina are expected to sell the liquified gas almost exclusively in Asia. GE, Hughes, Fluor Daniel, and other major corporations won contracts as well for projects in Indonesia. Another Exxon-Pertamina project is a new plant to supply Indonesia's state-owned electricity company, the London Financial Times added, noting also that U.S. taxpayers are generously helping to fund the projects by credits from the U.S. Export-Import Bank, ""part of new US `Tied-Aid' credit offers.""
All of this is sure to provide a huge flow of jobs for Americans -- at least lawyers, bankers, executives and managers, maybe a handful of skilled workers for a short period. But profits for U.S. investors? Perish the thought! The good news for U.S. workers caused a sharp increase in Exxon's stock.8
Another victory for efficient propaganda is that people wildly overestimate the percentage of the federal budget that goes to foreign aid and welfare. In fact, over half of discretionary federal spending is devoted to the military, one reason why ""the United States faces social and structural economic problems of a magnitude unknown to other economically advanced states,"" Benjamin Schwarz of the RAND corporation notes, including ""higher rates of infant mortality, illiteracy, malnutrition, and poverty than any other advanced industrialized country."" All getting worse, predictably, as the class war of the past decades intensifies in vigor and savagery. A study of the Bread for the World Institute reported a considerable decline in people suffering from hunger throughout the world in the 1980s, with only two exceptions: Africa, which registered an increase from 36% to 37%, and the United States, where the numbers increased 50% from 1985 to 1990 as ""conservative"" reforms took hold, increasing since.
The problem is most severe among children, with effects that are permanent: it is well-known that ""development of the brain is strongly influenced by the quality of the nourishment and nurturance given to infants and children,"" among other effects of ""adverse environments"" early in life that can lead ""to permanent defects in memory and learning"" (medical researchers John Frank and Fraser Mustard). But hunger among the elderly is also ""surging,"" the Wall Street Journal reports: ""several million older Americans are going hungry -- and their numbers are growing steadily,"" despite a federal law in force for 20 years ""aimed at providing free meals to anyone over 60."" Many are literally ""starving to death"" while some 5 million, about 16% of the population over 60, ""are either hungry or malnourished to some degree"" -- again, phenomena unknown in other developed societies, which lag behind us in the crusade for freedom and justice. ""The level of malnutrition and real hunger is only increasing,"" the assistant secretary for aging at the U.S. Department of Health reports.
To fully comprehend the meaning of such facts, one must bear in mind the unparalleled advantages of the United States. To select merely one indication, health and life expectancy levels of mid-18th century Americans were not achieved by the upper classes in Britain until the early 20th century -- not to speak of less privileged parts of the world. The social and economic catastrophe of American capitalism is quite an extraordinary phenomenon -- for the ""great beast,"" that is.9
Only 30% of the population are aware that military spending is the largest item on the Federal budget, and few of those know its scale or its purpose. Over a quarter think foreign aid is the biggest item. In fact, it is barely detectable. The U.S. has the most miserly record among the developed countries. The record is even worse if we exclude the parts intended to enhance U.S. control over Middle East energy reserves, ""aid"" to Israel, Egypt, and Turkey. By far the largest per capita component goes to a rich country, Israel -- artificially rich, because of the completely unparalleled flow of foreign capital including not just ""aid"" but also tax-deductible contributions that are used to maintain the sharp divisions between first- and second-class citizens, and (despite disclaimers) for the joint U.S.-Israel project of incorporating the bulk of the occupied territories within the eventual state of Israel. Eliminate that, and U.S. aid virtually vanishes -- putting aside its character and effects.
One-fifth of the population believe welfare to be the largest Federal expense. It is not too surprising, then, that the top priority for voters in 1994 was ""welfare reform"" (46%). The welfare system is ""just out of control,"" voters felt, though it pays to look more closely at actual attitudes. 44% of respondents feel that we are spending ""too much"" on welfare and 23% ""too little, economist Nancy Folbre notes, but when the phrase ""assistance to the poor"" is substituted for ""welfare"" in the same question, 13% say we are spending ""too much"" and 64% ""too little."" A reasonable speculation is that many people have absorbed Reaganite lies about ""welfare Queens"" (by insinuation, Black) driving Cadillacs, and believe that working people are supporting rich welfare recipients -- as they are, but not in the sense they imagine; we return to that.10
As already noted, the second-ranking priority for voters was health care reform (37%), though the impressive ideological warfare of the past year has left people utterly confused about what the realistic options might be. Public debate was framed within narrow bounds, the Clinton plan being the ""liberal option,"" with a few gestures to the ""radical extremists"" who thought the U.S. might consider joining the rest of the industrial world. The incomprehensible Clinton plan -- basically, a giveaway to huge insurance companies -- was rejected as just another ""big government"" proposal that would place people's fate in the hands of pointy-headed bureaucrats who steal our money by imposing a crushing tax burden; a publicly funded insurance program, to the extent it could even be considered, is still more odious in that respect.
The option preferred by the privileged is for the fate of everyone else to be in the hands of insurance company executives whose goal, as Milton Friedman can explain, is to ensure maximum profit and market share: meaning the worst possible health care; elimination of personal choice except for the rich; huge bureaucracies to micromanage physicians; public subsidy for advertising, profits, and multiple layers of high-paid managers and executives; and other massive inefficiencies that drive the U.S. off the spectrum in costs for heath care. The real meaning of the ""conservative"" option was illustrated right after the November election at the annual scientific convention of the American Heart Association, where leading specialists reported that insurers are increasingly unwilling to pay for preventive care that would reduce hospitalization rates by 75% (Dr. Lynne Stevenson of Boston's Brigham and Women's hospital). In contrast, they are quite willing to pay for heart transplants -- high tech operations that enrich the right people and institutions.
One radical extremist thought that rarely reached threshold is that in a civilized society, the costs of health care should be borne by progressive taxation, on the basis of the principle that the poor should be exempted from taxation, which should ""tax the higher portions of property in geometrical progression as they rise"" -- as observed by the noted Marxist Thomas Jefferson in a letter to his fellow-subversive James Madison. The United States is, again, off the spectrum on this aspect of human rights and needs, as measured by public share of health-care spending (which is as progressive as the tax system). The U.S. is far below any country that has achieved any form of development, even Greece and Portugal; it is barely above Turkey.11
2. ""Really existing conservatism""
The propaganda victories come into sharper focus when we compare popular perceptions with social and economic realities. Take welfare. It has sharply declined in real terms since 1970, Nancy Folbre observes, a downward spiral that is continuing, with more reductions in Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) in 1991 than in any year since 1981. From 1970, maximum AFDC benefits for a family of three with no other income fell over 40%, and the national average of AFDC benefits and food stamps combined is now at the level of AFDC alone in 1960 (before the food-stamp program was initiated).
A still more severe distortion is the unspoken premise that child care is not work: it comes free, like women's domestic labor generally -- ""the main reason why free-enterprise economies have worked relatively well over the decades,"" economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett comments. Child care therefore contrasts with Real Work: speculating in currency markets, devising tax shelters for the rich, arranging mergers and acquisitions that significantly reduce R&D and hence economic growth, and other contributions that rank high on the scale of social utility and merit according to standard dogma, which measures it by economic reward to the ""worker."" In particular, single women taking care of children are plainly not working, and therefore must be driven to the official workforce on grounds of ""economic efficiency"" (not to speak of justice), bipartisan doctrine holds. The assumptions are somewhere between nonsensical and insane, though reasonable enough within the general intellectual culture, with its tacit dedication to class warfare.
Even on the narrowest grounds, Folbre observes in the American Economic Association proceedings, ""public policy literally transfers resources from parents to nonparents by providing social insurance based on participation in paid employment without explicitly valuing time, effort, or money devoted to children,"" who are, in the longer term, the crucial factor determining ""economic health"" even in the highly distorted ideological sense of the technical notion. When real incomes in the middle quintile (about $30,000 in 1992 dollars) are adjusted for child care costs, they decline slightly through the 1970s, quite sharply from 1980 to the present as ""conservatism triumphed.""12
Responding to the ""public mood"" that has been shaped by a propaganda offensive of unusual intensity and fervor, the highest priority for the new Gingrich conservatives is to dismantle the welfare system. They announced at once that they would repeal the Food Stamp Act of 1977, the Child Nutrition Act of 1966, the National School Lunch Act of 1946, the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983, and other Federals laws intended to prevent hunger, particularly among children, which has not increased rapidly enough to satisfy the advocates of ""family values"" and ""free market"" verities. Furthermore, what programs remain are to be transferred to states, so as to bar any response to the typical sharp increase in need for food assistance when there is a recession, as in 1991-2, when food stamp rolls sometimes grew by 300,000 people a month. The plans will ""lead to a dramatic increase in hunger,"" Senator Patrick Leahy observed realistically; but that's nothing that has ever troubled the more loyal servants of the rich. Also on the legislative agenda -- with the support of the New Democrats -- are work obligations for mothers (who do not ""work,"" by ideological fiat) and reduction of AFDC, the main Federal Welfare program, which reaches 14.3 million people, over 9 million of them young children, who must ""learn responsibility"" and internalize our values: that there are no human rights, apart from what can be won in the labor market.
It would be unfair, however, to regard the leader, Newt Gingrich, as a heartless wretch. He proposes that the money saved from AFDC programs be used to build orphanages or ""group homes"" for children of families rendered destitute -- the state being the proper provider for children, not their mothers, under the doctrine of ""family values."" Perhaps the proposal is intended as a special contribution to the 1994 International Year of the Family. Or perhaps it is simply another useful federal subsidy, providing benefits to the construction industry, lawyers, and other people of the right sort.13
The real meaning of ""free market conservatism"" is illustrated by a closer look at the most passionate enthusiasts for ""getting the government off our backs"" and letting the market reign undisturbed. Take Newt Gingrich, the leader of the victorious congressional army who are taking over under a ""master plan"" that relied on huge contributions for Gingrich's GOPAC committee from corporate donors and others whose identity is a carefully-guarded secret. The measures are of dubious legality; GOPAC is now being sued by the Federal Elections Commission on grounds that it ""failed to register and report as a political committee."" But legal questions aside, the power play was ""a calculated political operation, unique on the contemporary American political scene"" (Ellen Miller, director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics), yet another blow at the despised principles of democracy and the pretensions of the ""great beast"" to meddle where it doesn't belong.14
Gingrich represents Cobb County Georgia, which the New York Times -- reasonably enough -- selected in a recent front-page story to illustrate the rising tide of ""conservatism"" aimed at ridding us of the ""nanny state."" The headline reads ""Conservatism Flowering Among the Malls,"" in this wealthy suburb of Atlanta, one of several that ""offer -- particularly to whites -- a sense of prosperity and safety, conservative Southern values and a relaxed, friendly way of life."" It's a ""Norman Rockwell world with fiber optic computers and jet airplanes,"" Gingrich comments with pride. With its ""history of inhospitality toward blacks,"" Cobb County is scrupulously insulated from any urban infection so that the inhabitants can enjoy the fruits of their ""enterpreneurial values"" and market enthusiasms in ""the conservative heart of a conservative region,"" defended in Congress by the leader of the conservative triumph.
A small footnote: Cobb County receives more federal subsidies than any suburban county in the country, with two exceptions: Arlington Virginia, effectively part of the Federal Government, and Brevard County Florida, the home of the Kennedy Space Center. When we move out of the state system itself, Cobb County is the leading beneficiary of the ""nanny state."" Its largest employer is Lockheed Aeronautical Systems Company, which is designing the F-22 advanced tactical fighter and other military aircraft. 72% of the workforce are in white-collar jobs ""in expanding areas of the economy like insurance, electronics and computers, and trade"" -- all carefully tended by ""the nanny state."" It's remarkably easy for conservative entrepreneurial values to flourish while one is feeding happily at the public trough. Meanwhile praises to market miracles reach the heavens, notably where ""conservatism is flowering among the malls.""15
An interesting sidelight is the silence over this matter during the electoral campaign, when Gingrich propaganda was smashing the New Democrats. Notably absent is a simple rejoinder that would have stopped the juggernaut in its tracks: Gingrich is the country's leading advocate of the welfare state -- for the rich. The reasons for the silence are not hard to discern: class interests prevail over narrow electoral ones. It's agreed across the board that the rich must be protected from market discipline by a powerful and interventionist welfare state.
Gingrich is the author of the ""Contract with America,"" which calls for extending the double-edged ""free market"": state protection and public subsidy for the rich, market discipline for the poor. The Contract calls for ""cuts in social spending,"" denying aid to children of ""minor mothers"" and those on welfare. Republican leaders add that they will support reductions proposed in the plan submitted by John Kasich, top Republican on the Budget Committee; its biggest cut is to be $50 billion from medicare and medicaid, the health programs for the elderly and the poor. But the Contract calls for an increase in welfare for the rich, by the classic means: regressive fiscal measures, and outright subsidy. These include increased tax exemptions for gifts and estates, capital gains cuts, reduced regulation for protection of health and safety standards, investment subsidies, more favorable rules for depreciation, and most important: ""strengthening our national defense"" so that we can better ""maintain our credibility around the world"" -- so that anyone who gets funny ideas, like priests and nuns in Latin America, will understand that ""What We Say Goes,"" as George Bush defined the New World Order while bombs and missiles were raining on Iraq.16
""National defense"" is, of course, a sick joke, which would elicit ridicule outside of a commissar culture. The U.S. faces no threats, and already spends almost as much on ""defense"" as the rest of the world combined. As in the past, military spending is arguably increasing security threats, for example, by arms exports, which now provide 25% of revenue for ""defense"" contractors and dominate the international arms market, increasing sharply since the end of the Cold War. Clinton has just added an important innovation: for the first time, policy will ""factor the health of U.S. weapons makers and the shape of the domestic economy into decisions on whether to approve foreign arms sales,"" the press reports; a natural step, now that the Soviet pretext has collapsed and it becomes necessary to face the facts more honestly.17
Unlike ""defense"" and ""security,"" military expenditures are no joke. They ensure that we will be able to ""behave, with others, multilaterally when we can and unilaterally as we must,"" the Clinton version of the traditional doctrine, delivered to the UN Security Council by Ambassador Madeleine Albright as it wavered over a resolution condemning Iraq. Albright instructed the Council that if need be, the U.S. would act alone because ""We recognize this area as vital to U.S. national interests"" -- and we recognize no limits or constraints, surely nothing as ridiculous as international law, human rights, or the United Nations, as we pursue our role as self-appointed global enforcer.18
Apart from maintaining a particular form of ""stability"" in the interests of the world rulers, the Pentagon must continue to provide lavishly for Newt Gingrich and his rich constituents by means of a taxpayer subsidy to advanced industry. Nothing has changed in this regard since the early post-war period, when the business world recognized that the aircraft industry, established by public funds and wartime profiteering, ""cannot satisfactorily exist in a pure, uncompetitive, unsubsidized, `free enterprise' economy"" (Fortune) and that ""the government is their only possible savior"" (Business Week). For well-known reasons, the Pentagon system was revitalized as the ""savior,"" sustaining and expanding the industry, now the leading ""civilian"" exporter, along with steel and metals generally, electronics, chemicals, machine tools, and other central components of the industrial economy. As long as the fable could be sustained, the Cold War provided the pretext. The fraud was conscious, at least among those minimally astute. The first Secretary of the Air Force, Stuart Symington, put the matter plainly in January 1948: ""The word to talk was not `subsidy'; the word to talk was `security'."" As industry representative in Washington, Symington regularly demanded enough procurement funds in the military budget to ""meet the requirements of the aircraft industry,"" in his words. The story continues without essential change until today, in just about every functioning sector of the economy, and surely in Cobb County.
Furthermore, the story goes back to the origins of the Republic: economic historian Paul Bairoch describes the United States as the ""mother country and bastion of modern protectionism,"" which was ""born in the United States"" -- which may be unfair to our British predecessors, no laggards in the art. Protectionism is only one form of state intervention, and not the major one. As in the British case, there are intermittent deviations from the commitment to protect the rich from market discipline, related to the expectation of temporary gain under conditions of dominance. When need arises, ""conservatives"" are quick to call for increased state intervention, as in the Reagan years. Had market forces been allowed to function, there would be no U.S. steel or automobile industry today, not to speak of computer chips and electronics generally. The Reaganites simply closed the market to Japanese competition while pouring in public funds.
Then-Secretary of the Treasury, James Baker proudly proclaimed to a business audience that Reagan had ""granted more import relief to US industry than any of his predecessors in more than half a century."" He was far too modest: it was actually more all his predecessors combined, doubling import restrictions to 23%. One of the few authentic free trade advocates, international economist Fred Bergsten, added that the Reagan Administration specialized in the kind of ""managed trade"" that most ""restricts trade and closes markets,"" voluntary export restraint agreements -- which are ""voluntary"" in the sense that protection payments to the Mafia enforcer are ""voluntary."" This is ""the most insidious form of protectionism,"" Bergsten pointed out, which ""raises prices, reduces competition and reinforces cartel behavior."" The 1994 Economic Report to Congress estimates that Reaganite protectionist measures reduced US manufacturing imports by about one-fifth. Such measures have been expanded under Clinton, one recent example being the proposal to spend $1 billion to subsidize development and production of flat-panel computer display screens, subsidies barred by the GATT accords signed a few weeks earlier.19
This is just the tip of the iceberg. The ""bought priesthood"" may spin tales about market discipline and its virtues, but business executives and the government that is their ""shadow"" will tolerate no such nonsense -- for the rich, that is.
Gingrich's Contract is remarkably brazen. Thus the proposals for welfare for the rich appear under the heading ""The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act."" The section does include a provision for measures ""to create jobs and raise worker wages"" -- with the word ""unfunded"" quietly added. But no matter. In contemporary Newspeak, the word ""jobs"" means ""profits,"" so it is indeed a ""job creation"" proposal, which will continue to ""enhance"" wages downwards.
The pattern is virtually exceptionless. Former Senate Democratic leader George Mitchell was replaced in November by Olympia Snowe, a prominent conservative, whose campaign focused on protecting the Portsmouth Naval shipyard and Loring Air Force base -- that is, making sure that Federal largesse continues to flow, the benefits heavily skewed towards the wealthy, though the official mantra is ""jobs."" Even looking just at the narrow matter of welfare, we find much the same thing. The Center for Popular Economics (Amherst) estimates that when we consider direct benefits and tax breaks -- masked welfare payments -- an average household with income under $10,000 receives about 60% of the welfare provided to households with income over $100,000. Looking at details, total payments for food stamps in 1993 amounted to $25 billion, welfare and family support $16 billion, and supplemental security income (poor, elderly, disabled) $21 billion. These figures may be compared with the $49 billion in deductions for interest payments, mostly mortgage payments (80% to familes with incomes over $50,000, skewed more radically toward the higher reaches, for obvious reasons). Farm price supports, again skewed toward the wealthy, amounted to $16 billion. Total payments to the poor ""add up to less than the three largest tax breaks that benefit the middle class and wealthy: deductions for retirement plans, the deduction for home mortgage interest and the exemption of health-insurance premiums that companies pay for their employees,"" Michael Wines reports in the Times in a rare window opened to the real world, noting further that ""most tax breaks and payments to the well-situated are practically exempt from the debate over controlling expenditures.""20
This, of course, is the merest fragment, not counting such matters as ""business expenses"" (dinners at elegant restaurants, prize seats at the opera and sporting events, club memberships, etc.), all small in comparison with the massive subsidies through the system of protection and subsidy by the ""nanny state."" Simply to indicate scale, in Canada, less extreme than the U.S. in its dedication to a nanny state for the rich, the National Council of Welfare estimates that day care facilities for the 750,000 children who need them would cost $1.5 billion, not a great deal more than the tax money lost by the business entertainment deduction.21
Reacting to the ""Contract,"" Labor Secretary Robert Reich suggested that Congress end ""corporate welfare as we know it,"" removing tax breaks for particular industries and agriculture that amount to tens of billions a year. He also noted that over a quarter of taxes go to pay interest on the national debt, most of it accumulated by the statist reactionaries of the 1980s, who played their spend-and-borrow games under the conservative disguise. Reich's speech on economic and social policy was prominently reported -- in the London Financial Times, though for accuracy, it did receive a few lines under ""World-Wide Notes"" in the Wall Street Journal, the same day.22
The principles are clear and explicit: free markets are fine for the Third World and its growing counterpart at home. Mothers with dependent children can be sternly lectured on the need for self-reliance, but not dependent executives and investors, please. For them, the welfare state must flourish.
Focusing on rich countries like ours is highly misleading, to put it mildly. The double-edged ""free market ideology"" has by far its most lethal effects in the traditional colonial domains, which, apart from the Japan-based area, are mostly an utter disaster, improving here and there only by ideologically-based economic measures that dispense with effects on people. While almost all industrial societies have become more protectionist in past years, the Reaganites generally led the pack. The effects on the South have been devastating, compounding the consequences of the IMF-World Bank structural adjustment programs, which have had a brutal impact on the poor majority while benefiting foreign investors and elite sectors linked to them.
Market distortions by the rich have been a major factor in doubling the already huge gap between the poorest and richest countries in the past generation. The 1992 UN Development Report estimates that various protectionist and financial measures taken by the rich countries have deprived the South of $1/2 trillion a year, about 12 times total ""aid"" -- most of it publicly-subsidized export promotion. This behavior is ""virtually criminal,"" the distinguished Irish diplomat and author Erskine Childers observed recently. He also notes that the West, under U.S. lead, blocked a 1991 resolution tabled at the General Assembly by the South against ""economic measures as a means of political and economic coercion against developing countries,"" the favored technique, apart from terror, by which the U.S. has sought to destroy such independent upstarts as Cuba and Nicaragua -- while never ceasing to sing odes to the free market. The fact is ""very little known,"" Childers writes, ""because of course such things do not get reported by the dominant Northern media."" He hopes that some day this ""wholesale moral abdication by Northern countries"" will lead to ""their utter shame before their own citizens,"" shame that will ""start on the day when Northern academicians and NGOs"" institute ""a Blackmail Watch"" to stand alongside the Human Rights Watches.23
Not tomorrow, we can be sure of that.
With hopelessly inadequate apologies to the victims, I'll put aside that terrible story of major crimes against humanity, for which we bear continuing responsibility.
Next month, I'll turn to two topics: the specific measures that are being used to control the surplus population, and the general background against which these crimes against humanity proceed. The former include the growing ""crime industry,"" unrelated to crime but closely related to the need to cage those growing categories of the population who have no role to play in enriching the wealthy and privileged, and therefore lack rights by ""conservative"" values. Another striking component is the war against families and children that was led by Reagan-Thatcher conservatives and is now to be sharply enhanced. Yet another is the effort to restore something like the Satanic Mills of the early period of industrialization, for those who retain some rights under reigning values. All of this is entirely reasonable, as major tendencies in the global economy of the past quarter century have at least raised the possibility that the world might be driven to an extreme form of totalitarian domination by wealthy and powerful sectors, with the gains for human rights, freedom, and democracy won in bitter struggle over centuries now reversed -- a shift from ""containment"" to ""rollback,"" to borrow some of the (largely deceitful) terminology of foreign policy discussion.

Rollback, Part II
February, 1995
The new year opened auspiciously with the announcement of the revolutionary agenda of the ""conservatives,"" responding to the ""popular mandate"" conferred by their ""landslide victory"" -- in which they gained 50.5 percent of the votes of the minority who took part and were overwhelmingly opposed by non-voters, while one-sixth of those who did vote regarded the outcome as ""an affirmation of the Republican agenda"" and one out of nine saw ""a more conservative Congress"" as an issue. Meanwhile large majorities, as usual, favored more government spending for domestic programs and more help for the poor, reduced military spending, and other traditional parts of the ""liberal agenda"" that the population had overwhelmingly repudiated, according to standard doctrine.1
1. The Conservative Agenda
The ""conservatives"" -- I'll adopt the term, reluctantly -- cannot be faulted for concealing what they have in mind. Their agenda hews closely to the traditional double-edged conception of markets, personal responsibility, freedom from government interference, and so on. The slogans are to be interpreted literally and harshly for everyone -- apart from the rich minority, who are exempt from such strictures. Quite the contrary. The interests of the privileged are to be enhanced by a powerful and interventionist ""nanny state,"" which transfers vast public subsidies to them and otherwise caters to their whims. Newt Gingrich's conservative constituents in their wealthy Atlanta suburb cannot be expected to face market discipline. They must maintain their lead among recipients of public subsidies, so that they can bask in self-praise for their ""independence"" and ""entrepreneurial values,"" and indulge in their ""visceral distaste"" for the federal government that fills their pockets with public funds -- without which, they would soon join the laggards and spongers they despise.2
Clinton's first response to the ""conservative landslide"" was to increase Pentagon spending, already high even by Cold War levels. He announced an increase of $25 billion over the next six years, directly contravening the public will; the Gingrich ""Contract with America"" calls for $60 billion. As well understood within the business community, the Pentagon is a central component of the ""nanny state"" -- for the rich, Gingrich's constituents in particular.
The new Republican leadership opened their campaign with plans for ""welfare reform."" The proposals are fine-tuned to the principles of class warfare. By far the largest entitlements (among those that are mentionable, that is) are Social Security and Medicare. But benefits under these programs are not class-based: not only the poor reach retirement age. Furthermore, funding of Social Security is sufficiently regressive to make it more tolerable. These huge and rapidly growing programs are therefore not on the ""conservative agenda"" -- for now; as policy marches on from containment of human rights and democracy to rollback, they too are unlikely to survive, since the wealthy can prosper without them. The programs that face radical cuts are food stamps, AFDC, and Medicaid. AFDC reaches 14 million people who are destitute, 9.7 million of them children; it has declined sharply since 1970, particularly since the Reagan years. Medicaid provides health care for 33 million people who cannot afford it. Though a small fragment of officially-recognized ""welfare,"" these programs are designed to help people who are weak and defenseless, therefore subject to market discipline and the demands of ""personal responsibility.""
The reforms are still more finely honed. The food stamp program is likely to survive, the New York Times reports, because it has a ""middle-class constituency that includes farmers, grocers, and the food industry generally."" Agribusiness, great marketing chains, and the transnationals that dominate the food industry are a ""middle class constituency"" with human rights. But AFDC lacks these merits. Over five million children are to be deprived of its meager support, though they ""would not be harmed"" by losing their subsistence, Republican House leaders assure us, because ""adults on welfare will protect their children by working or getting married"" -- taking jobs that do not provide a living wage (if they even exist), and marrying men who can join the surging prison population when they fail to find work.3
The planned tax cuts reveal the same refined sensibility. They are designed to benefit ""the truly wealthy,"" the Times editors accurately comment, including ""capital gains tax cuts and depreciation write-offs for business"" that will ""run the deficit up even higher,"" and that should properly be called transfer payments from the poor to the rich. Other tax cuts are supposedly intended to benefit ""the middle class."" The category includes people who earn up to $100,000 a year (more than 96 percent of taxpayers) as the President defines the term, and up to $200,000 a year (more than 99 percent of taxpayers) under the Republican definition. That means ""there is almost no one left to pick up the tab,"" so the burden is placed overwhelmingly on the shoulders of those least able to bear it. The major ""middle class"" tax cut a credit for dependent children, a regressive measure that offers little or nothing to people too poor to take advantage of it. That aside, it benefits primarily the rich: ""Generally, the more income that taxpayers have, the more likely they are to have dependent children,"" the Times reports: ""For instance, 55 percent of taxpayers with incomes from $100,000 to $200,000 in 1991 claimed at least one exemption for a dependent,"" as compared with 42 percent in the $30,000-$35,000 range (close to the actual ""middle class"").
The tax cuts too are hailed by their bipartisan advocates as a response to the popular will, which was revealed by a Harris poll after the elections. Two-thirds felt the state of the nation was not good. Their reasons varied, including high taxes -- selected by three percent.4
The ""hidden welfare state"" for the rich, with its huge entitlements concealed by tax deductions and other devious means, scarcely enters the debate over welfare reform. But it is by no means unaffected. ""Buried in the House Republicans' `Contract with America' is a very sweet deal for the nation's big capital-intensive companies,"" the Wall Street Journal reported in December, reviewing an array of tax breaks and other devices that will ""provide a sizable subsidy"" to corporations, possibly eliminating taxable income entirely for large firms, and increasing the deficit in accord with the Reaganite version of ""fiscal conservatism."" The program is carefully crafted so that its impact will not be felt until 1997 -- coincidentally, after the presidential election, something we are not supposed to notice. IRS officials predict a cost to the taxpayer of over $14 billion a year by the end of the decade.
Reacting to the Gingrich Contract, Labor Secretary Robert Reich gave a speech last November in which he suggested ending ""Corporate welfare as we know it""; it was reported in the business press abroad, and received a few words in the Wall Street Journal as well. The Journal returned to the topic a few weeks later in an article by Alan Murray on the tax breaks that ""shower billions in benefits on the oil and gas, timber, cattle-breeding and real-estate industries and others,"" one minor component of the ""nanny state"" for the rich. Murray referred to ""Mr. Reich's broadside against corporate welfare,"" noting that it ""was quickly shot down by friendly fire"" from the White House and Cabinet. The Administration had discussed cutting back the ""$114 billion of spending over the next five years that benefits specific industries, as well as $110 billion in tax subsidies,"" some for single industries, some aimed at public funding of advertising and purchase of mansions (through tax subsidies). All such ideas are ""going nowhere,"" however, and ""already have been taken off the table.""
The mood was symbolized at the first triumphal session of the new Congress, with the Gingrich army in charge. In a ""half-hearted"" gesture, House Democrats sought ""to embarrass Republicans for declining to include a ban on lobbyists' gifts in the new rules,"" the Wall Street Journal mentioned on p. 16. There was also brief notice in the Times, quoting the reaction of the Commander-in-Chief himself. Gingrich said he'd ""heard rumors that imply that they're just into sort of a fairly stupid strategy of cheap and nasty,"" which ""makes one wonder just how dumb they think the American people are."" Imagine how the public would react to the idea of making it harder for corporations to purchase votes in our model democracy.5
State governments are responding to the ""popular mandate"" the same way. In New York, a draft proposal of Governor-elect George Pataki's administration calls for a cut of over $1 billion in Medicaid, while Mayor Rudolph Giuliani proposed a 25 percent reduction in Medicaid and other help for the poor. To better comprehend these measures, one may bear in mind that in Manhattan the income gap between rich and poor is greater than in Guatemala, and within the U.S. is surpassed only by a group of 70 households in a former leper colony in Hawaii. The gap widened in the 1980s more than in any other county with over 50,000 people.6
The justification for such budgetary proposals is dual: the ""popular mandate"" that overwhelmingly opposes them, and the lack of funds. The mandate is beyond challenge: ""Americans Like G.O.P. Agenda,"" a lead story is headlined in the New York Times, citing data showing that 65 percent of the public believe ""the Government has a responsibility to take care of the poor"" while 9 percent think ""programs for poor children"" should be decreased. Support for a balanced budget amendment is equally impressive: ""22 percent, if it would require cuts in spending on education,"" and comparable figures if other cuts in social spending are contemplated.
Equally beyond challenge is the ""fact"" that there just isn't enough money available in this ""lean and mean"" age. Times are tough all over, particularly for the great corporations that are enjoying ""dazzling"" profits, Fortune magazine exults. Meanwhile Business Week worries over ""The Problem Now: What To Do With All That Cash"" (headline), as ""surging profits"" are ""overflowing the coffers of Corporate America"" and dividends are booming, thanks in large measure to profits from overseas operations (in the interest of ""jobs for Americans""). Meanwhile the Census bureau reports that 95 percent of the population has lost income since 1989, with a 7 percent decline in median family income, continuing through the ""Clinton recovery."" Real hourly pay (including benefits) has fallen 1 percent a year for the median male since 1979, including the 1991-93 recovery years, labor economists Jared Bernstein and Lawrence Mishel report.7
Less delighted are city governments, which will face the problems created as federal government and the states shift benefits towards the wealthy even more than under the prevailing norms. Meeting in December, the U.S. Conference of Mayors reported that requests by needy people increased by 12 percent in 1994, requests for emergency shelter even more. 15 percent of requests for emergency food aid had to be denied, along with almost 1/4 of requests by homeless families, who remained homeless an average of 9 months. The Mayors' Conference called for an increase in federal assistance programs, responding to a different ""popular mandate"" than the one that is perceived by the political class and media elite: the popular mandate reflected consistently in polls but irrelevant to policy, which is ""insulated from politics,"" to borrow a useful phrase from the London Economist.8
Another target is foreign aid, ""already by far the lowest of any major industrialised country as a proportion of gross domestic product,"" the Financial Times observes, and virtually non-existent if we eliminate the grants to the primary recipient (Israel, a rich first world country, thanks to unprecedented subsidy from abroad) and the secondary beneficiaries, to make sure they play their role in guaranteeing U.S. control over Middle East energy reserves. Senator Mitch McConnell, who will chair the Subcommittee on Foreign Operations, announced that aid should be restricted to advancing ""America's security and economic interests."" That is overwhelmingly true already, but the principle must be implemented more harshly still. The pennies that go to Africa, for example, serve almost no useful purpose, merely helping human beings. While aid to most countries should be cut, McConnell announced, aid to the Middle East should be increased: primarily to Israel, then to other Middle East gendarmes.9
Also facing the axe are regulatory measures, mostly unenforced by the criminal state during the Reagan years, a primary reason for the collapse of unions and the sharp rise in industrial accidents, Business Week reported in an important cover story. New proposals aim to reduce or eliminate such ""market distortions,"" which merely save lives at the cost of profits. These December 1994 announcements were exquisitely timed, coinciding with new disclosures about the effects of the failure to control predatory profit-seeking. On December 19, the Boston Globe reviewed the destruction of the Georges Bank fishing grounds off the New England coast, formerly one of the world's richest. Parts had to be closed completely in mid-December, with more drastic actions anticipated, in the hope that the fish population, virtually depleted, might recover -- a vain hope, many scientists fear. After the area was closed to foreign boats by a 200-mile fishing limit declared in 1976, U.S. fishing operations nearly doubled, spurred by government tax credits. The predictable result of state subsidy and lack of regulation was to decimate populations of cod, haddock, and other major stocks. Cod may become ""virtually extinct,"" the Northeast Fisheries Science Center predicted. New England, the traditional home of codfish, is now importing its cod from Norway. The government of Norway ""took strong measures to stop overfishing years ago,"" following a ""different philosophical tradition from North America,"" one that allows the government, in the public interest, to place some controls on ""economic actors"" (Kare Bryn, director of the resources department in Norway's fisheries ministry). The ""philosophical tradition"" here is quite different, allowing the government only to offer massive protection and public subsidy to business interests in accord with our deep-seated libertarian commitments.
""In the 1980s,"" the vice-chair of the government Fishery Management Council concedes, ""there was not enough conservation and too much concern about the impacts it would have"" (on short-term profit, to be precise). ""I think everybody regrets that now, but that's like crying over spilled milk."" The regrets are revealed by the passionate dedication to dismantle what is left of the regulatory apparatus so as to maximize the scale of future tragedies.10
The day after this report was published, President Clinton announced his plans to implement the ""conservative program,"" with cuts in government spending (apart from the Pentagon subsidy to the rich, which is to increase). The major cuts are to be in the Energy department, slowing down cleanup of nuclear waste, cutting research, and turning management of the petroleum reserve to ""private enterprise"" -- the term is even more of a joke than usual, in reference to the energy industry. The same day, the New York Times reported new scientific evidence on the depletion of the ozone layer and global warming. Satellite data revealed that industrial gases are the primary factor in depletion of the ozone layer, which scientists fear might spread over northern areas; and satellites also provided the most precise data yet available on rise of the sea level, showing it to be within the range predicted by global warming models. The potential threat to human life is not trivial.
Also on the same day, the staff of the House Health and Environment Subcommittee released a report reviewing tobacco industry data purporting to show that secondhand smoke is not a significant hazard in workplaces. The data had been a ""significant element"" in industry campaigns to bar regulation, the report observed. The data were ""faked,"" according to workers who took the measurements. The conclusion was supported by the House committee's research staff and an independent review by a chemist at the Naval Research Laboratory. When the fakery is corrected, the hazard proves to be considerably higher. Is that a surprise, when an industry ""regulates"" itself? Perhaps to really dedicated commissars. Incoming chair Thomas Bliley of Virginia, ""an industry champion"" (Business Week), refused to comment.
Other efforts to save lives from depredations by the rulers are also to decline under the conservative regimen. Among other consequences, the Environmental Protection Agency and Occupational Safety & Health Administration are likely to lose much of their limited effect, and pharmaceutical prescriptions may not have to provide information about safe drug use. The basic plan is to impose conditions on any regulatory statute that will be almost impossible to meet: for example, largely meaningless ""cost-benefit analyses"" that can be extended without limit by corporate lawyers of even limited intelligence.
The human consequences are not hard to predict, but short-term profit will increase for the publicly-subsidized ""private"" sector of the economy. Civilization marches on.
Other proposed measures lead in the same direction. One component of the current crusade is to shift such government funding as remains to the states (outside of the expanding ""nanny state"" for the wealthy). It is anticipated that state governments will be much more susceptible to the influence of private tyranny, which overwhelms local populations in resources and can play one against another in the time-honored fashion. An illustration, reported just as the crusade was launched, is the effect of the decision by Congress in 1991 to transfer control over transportation funds to the states. Of the $35 billion that has gone to them so far, 96 percent was used for highway projects, in violation of the intent of the legislation to support mass transit, according to the chair of the House Committee on Public Works and Transporation, Norman Mineta, one of its authors. Some attribute this ""massive institutional civil disobedience"" to pressures from ""entrenched highway construction interests,"" but a look back to the huge federal social engineering projects that destroyed public transportation and ""suburbanized America"" in the interests of dominant components of the corporate sector suggests broader goals. President Clinton's first proposed reductions should accelerate the process. ""One such cut would reduce Federal spending for highway, bridge, airport and rail infrastructure for $5 billion and give the states more discretion on spending the rest"" (NYT): ""The end result could be more potholes and higher fares for many taxpayers."" One can guess, perhaps, that mass transport will end up being the primary target, as plans reach practice.
The basic principles have long been familiar, and are sometimes articulated plainly enough. After a recent series of ferry disasters in the Baltic with hundreds of lives lost, the former president of Britain's Royal Institution of Naval Architects pointed out that measures to overcome the problems are well understood, but owners won't follow them ""unless they are forced. You choose whether you have regulation or let thousands more people die."" The stakes here are far greater, but the principle is the same. Short-term gain for the privileged few might be impaired if the welfare of the general population and future generations is taken into consideration, and under the ""civilized values"" that Newt Gingrich and other rollback advocates seek to instill, the relative weights are clear.11
2. The Surplus Population
When the doctrines of contemporary ""neoliberalism"" were crafted in early 19th century England, the message to the population was clear and simple: under capitalism, you have no rights, apart from what your labor will bring in the market. A person without independent wealth ""has no claim of right to the smallest portion of food, and, in fact, has no business to be where he is,"" Malthus proclaimed in highly influential work. It is a ""great evil"" and violation of ""natural liberty"" to mislead the poor into believing that they have further rights, David Ricardo held, outraged at this assault against the principles of economic science, which are as immutable as the principles of gravitation, he held, and against the moral principles on which the science rests, no less exalted. The message is simple. You have a free choice: the labor market, the workhouse prison, death, or go somewhere else -- as was possible when vast spaces were opening thanks to the extermination and expulsion of indigenous populations.12
The doctrines are being revived, but under radically different conditions. Ricardo's ""science"" was founded on the principle that capital is more or less immobile and labor highly mobile. We are enjoined today to worship the consequences of Ricardo's science, despite the fact that the assumptions on which they are based have been reversed: capital is highly mobile, and labor virtually immobile -- libertarian conservatives lead the way in rejecting Adam Smith's principle that ""free circulation of labor"" is a cornerstone of free trade, in keeping with their contempt for markets (except for the weak). Other assumptions of the ""science"" are so radically false that the whole topic is hard to take seriously: among them, the abstraction from severe market distortions resulting from the centrally-managed transactions of the huge corporate structures that dominate the international economy, and the reliance on the ""nanny state"" that has been such a decisive factor in economic growth and the specific forms it has taken throughout history, and remains so.
The science originated as a weapon of class warfare, has been adapted for similar ends over the years. It is returning to its origins today as the prospects for rollback improve, narrowing substantially the choices for the growing population who lack rights by doctrinal decision -- termed ""science"" or ""natural law.""
The surplus population has to be kept in ignorance, but also controlled. The problem is faced directly in the Third World domains that have long been dominated by the West and therefore reflect the guiding values of the masters most clearly: here favored devices include death squads, ""social cleansing,"" torture, and other techniques of proven effectiveness. At home, more civilized methods are (still) required. The superfluous population is to be cooped up within urban slums that increasingly resemble concentration camps, or if that fails, sent to prisons, the counterpart in a richer society to the death squads we train and support in our domains. Under Reaganite enthusiasts for state power, the number of prisoners in the U.S. almost tripled, leaving our main competitors, South Africa and Russia, well behind -- though Russia has just caught up, now that they are mastering the values of their American tutors.13
The bipartisan crime bill should facilitate the process of controlling the unwanted population, with its vast new expenditures for prisons, sharp increase in the death penalty, and much harsher sentencing procedures. Again, this is an acceptable form of state action, serving the social function of population control and providing yet another Keynesian stimulus to the economy: to the construction industry, lawyers, security personnel, and so on. The public subsidy of the ""crime industry"" is coming to approach the scale of the Pentagon, though it is less favored: its benefits are not so sharply skewed towards the wealthy. Nonetheless, it's reasonable that Gingrich's Contract should call for expanding this aspect of the war against the general public.
The crime rate has not changed significantly for twenty years, and recently has declined, if official figures can be taken seriously. The FBI reported in early December that crime rates in 1994 decreased to the lowest level since 1986 for overall crime, since 1990 for violent crime, and since 1985 for property crime (though white collar crime is only sporadically reported). But punishment has gone up fast, as the rate of incarceration shows, and in highly restricted ways, targeting the most vulnerable sectors, mainly Blacks and Latinos; the close race-class correlation in the U.S. makes the procedure only more natural. These sectors are regarded as a criminal population, one leading criminologist, William Chambliss, concludes from recent studies, including direct observation by students and faculty in a project with the Washington police. That's not exactly correct. Criminals are supposed to have constitutional rights, but as his on-the-scene studies show, these communities do not. They are effectively under military occupation. ""Young Black and Latino men living in America's ghettos and barrios are under siege from, and at war with, the police,"" Chambliss writes.
The 1994 Crime Bill is designed to increase the prison population and the costs of maintaining it, with little if any effect on crime. The ""three strikes"" provision ensures that people will remain in prison long past the age when criminal actions are likely, as has much research has shown; and the aging population will either require minimal (and costly) care or be left to die, in keeping with expansion of the right to kill granted to state authority under contemporary libertarian doctrine. The Crime Bill also ends funding for vocational and other training (Pell Grants), slight expenditures that markedly decrease recidivism and prison violence. Such measures make no sense as part of a ""war against crime."" They make a lot of sense, however, as part of a war against the population, with two aspects: removal of people superfluous for profit-making, and control of the large majority targeted for reduction of quality of life and opportunity, who must be somehow frightened into submission to authority.14
The largely fraudulent ""drug war"" has served as an effective device for this population control program. Criminalization of drugs has increased crime -- including crime by government agencies from local police to the CIA -- though studies show no effect on drug availability or use, and decriminalization, where it has been tried, seems to have increased neither. In 1992, nearly 30 percent of state and over 55 percent of federal prisoners were convicted on drug charges (a third for marijuana). Two-thirds of these arrests were for possession, not sale or manufacture. One finds few executives of banks or chemical corporations in prison, though banks are surely involved in money laundering -- a banking subsidiary of American Express just paid $32 million in a settlement in a money-laundering case, with no criminal charges15 -- and the government estimates that more than 90 percent of the chemicals used to produce cocaine come from the United states. A Reagan-era CIA study concluded that U.S. exports of such chemicals to Latin America far exceed amounts used for any legal commercial purpose, concluding that they are diverted to heroin and cocaine production.
It has been well-documented that the drug business has trailed U.S. subversive and counterinsurgency activities quite closely since the CIA helped re-establish the Mafia-run heroin racket in France after World War II as part of the program to undermine the labor movement and the anti-fascist resistance. The reasons are also too well known to recount. The latest phase, unsurprisingly, involves Afghanistan, where the U.S. spent billions of dollars through the 1980s in support of the Islamic fundamentalist extremist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who has taken the lead in tearing to shreds what remained of the shattered country after the Russian invaders withdrew. The Far Eastern Economic Review reports that 1994 opium production in Afghanistan is the biggest crop the world has ever seen, enabling Afghanistan and Pakistan (the base for the CIA operations) to win first place in world heroin-production, overtaking the Golden Triangle that gained that status as a by-product of U.S. subversion and aggression a generation ago.
""It is now widely accepted,"" the Review reports, ""that the U.S. deliberately played down heroin production by the mujahideen during these years"" (1980-89), causing at least one DEA agent to resign in disgust because of the CIA's protection of known druglords. One consequence is that Pakistan, with no significant drug problem in 1980, now has perhaps as many as 2 million heroin addicts, while heroin-export earnings amount to about 20 percent of its formal exports, a UN report estimates. Most of the heroin produced ends up in the United States.
The leading drug-producing center in the Western hemisphere, Colombia, gives more insight into the nature of the ""drug war."" The leading human rights violator in the hemisphere, Colombia also receives the most U.S. military aid, now more than half of what goes to the entire hemisphere, increasing under Clinton. The Jesuit-based Justice and Peace Bulletin just published a study of human rights abuses during the last year of the administration of Cesar Gaviria, Washington's favorite, recently imposed as Secretary-General of the OAS in a Washington power-play that was much resented. The general picture is horrendous, as before, but the ""anti-drug strategy"" is particularly relevant here. Colombia had two major cartels: Medellin and Cali. The Medellin cartel, the Bulletin reports, ""evolved out of popular low class origins with a marked tendency to show off its wealth ostentatiously and act in a `Robin Hood'-like manner, implementing social projects in poor areas of the city and with a military apparatus separate from and threatening and aggressive towards the government,"" which is regarded as an enemy by much of the population. The Cali cartel, ""with aristocratic upper class roots, discreet and careful to camouflage and blend its wealth in with that of the country's well-to-do industrialists and businessmen, infiltrated into all of the government's spheres of influence and power with a military apparatus allied and coordinated with government armed forces.""
The two cartels were accorded very different treatment. The Gaviria administration destroyed the Medellin cartel in military operations that involved massacres, large-scale torture, disappearances, and illegal arrests. The Cali cartel has had a more pleasant fate, including leaders who were ""involved in horrible massacres carried out in alliance with members of the armed forces."" It now enjoys ""absolute territorial domination and control"" in major drug-producing regions, where paramilitary groups allied with the military have established ""veritable strongholds.""
Nevertheless, the Cali cartel is harshly treated in comparison to the leading narcotrafficking mobsters. It is conventional and convenient to externalize the issue, focusing attention on evil creatures in foreign lands who poison our children and destroy our cities. A useful corrective is offered in a study by the OECD (the organization of the wealthy industrial societies), reviewed in Mexico's main journal Excelsior by Apolinar Biaz-Callejas of the Andean Commission of Jurists and the Latin American Association for Human Rights. The OECD study found that ""the money produced by drug trafficking throughout the world reached $460 billion in 1993, of which the U.S. received $260 billion, which is circulated through its financial system, in contraband, and through other ways. Colombia, as a producer-exporter, gets only $5 to $7 billion, or 2 to 3 percent of what remains in the U.S. The big business is, therefore, in that country,"" veiled in anonymity and beyond reach of law.16
At home, both criminal law and police practice are ""blatantly racist,"" Chambliss concludes. Blacks constitute two-thirds of prisoners in state prisons convicted of drug offenses and 40 percent of all drug arrests, though more Whites than Blacks use illegal drugs and more than 80 percent of the population is White. Possession of a small amount of crack cocaine, the drug of choice in the ghetto, ""carries a mandatory five-year prison sentence without the possibility of parole but possession of a hundred times that amount of cocaine powder (the drug of choice of the white middle class) has no mandatory sentence.""
While crime has not changed much in scale or character in the last twenty years, perceptions have. The perceptions did not precede and motivate government crime laws, as has been claimed by James Q. Wilson and other conservative scholars. Rather, as polls show, concerns were stimulated by right-wing political elements, primarily from the 1960s. In that period, Chambliss points out, crime could serve as ""a smokescreen"" to conceal other issues ""as well as legitimation for legislation designed primarily to suppress political dissent and overturn Supreme Court decisions.""
Blacks are particularly targeted because they are defenseless and have little influence. And engendering fear is, of course, a standard method of population control, whether the chosen targets are Blacks, Jews, immigrants, homosexuals, or whatever. These are the basic reasons, it seems, for the growth of ""the crime control industry."" Not that crime isn't a real threat to safety and survival. It certainly is, particularly for the poor. But the problem is not being addressed; rather, used as a method of population control, in various ways.
Children are also vulnerable and defenseless, hence another fit target for conservatives-on-the-march. The matter has recently been addressed in several important books, one a 1993 UNICEF study by U.S. economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett that deals with child care in rich societies, another by the Canadian writer Linda McQuaig, the #1 bestseller in Canada for 23 weeks.17 Studying the past 15 years, Hewlett finds a sharp split between Anglo-American societies and those of continental Europe and Japan; McQuaig finds the same effect, and focuses on the consequences for Canada as it shifts towards the Reagan-Thatcher model. This model, Hewlett writes, has been a ""disaster"" for children and families; the European-Japanese model, in contrast, has improved their situation considerably. Both authors attribute the Anglo-American ""disaster"" to the ideological preference for free markets. That's only half true: whatever one chooses to call the reigning ideology, it is unfair to tarnish the good name of ""conservatism"" by applying it to this form of violent, lawless, reactionary statism, which despises markets almost as much as it does democracy and freedom.
Causes aside, there isn't much doubt about the effects of the free market for the weak, what Hewlett calls the ""anti-child spirit  is loose in these lands"" subjected to the ""neglect-filled Anglo-American model,"" which has largely privatized child-rearing while making it effectively impossible for most of the population. The result is a predictable disaster for children and families, while in the ""much more supportive `European' model,"" social policy has strengthened support systems for families and children.
It's no great secret. A Blue-Ribbon Commission of the National Association of State Boards of Education and the American Medical Association concluded in 1990 that ""Never before has one generation of children been less healthy, less cared for or less prepared for life than their parents were at the same age"" -- though only in the Anglo-American societies, where an anti-child, anti-family spirit has reigned for 15 years under the guise of ""conservatism"" and ""family values."" This is yet another triumph of the ""bought priesthood,"" as the independent working class press referred to the intellectual servants of power a century ago, before free expression was overcome by state repression and market forces.
Conservatives are not devoted only to children and families, but also to the ""middle classes,"" which have declined under their rule to levels well below those of comparable countries (Japan, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, etc.) as society is split more sharply into rich and poor. The gap has so widened that the director of the respected Luxembourg Income Study, U.S. economist Timothy Smeeding, shocked Congress with data showing that the U.S. tolerates ""a level of disadvantage unknown to any other major country on earth.""18
New York City, mentioned earlier, happens to be an extreme case, but the pattern is quite general, and even extends to U.S. domains. Latin America is the region of traditional U.S. influence. It also has the most extreme inequality in the world, thanks in large measure to specific policies designed to prevent a form of ""economic nationalism"" which, it was feared, would lead to more egalitarian and independent development. The current favorites are typical in that regard, from Mexico to Argentina.
Mexico's neoliberal achievements were lauded effusively until the bubble burst in recent weeks. The achievements included slow economic growth despite a huge flow of foreign assistance to make the miracle work, falling real wages, and growing inequality. The Mexican government concedes that ""the number of citizens living below the poverty line has increased from 13 million in 1990 to 24 million in 1994."" Closely tracking this impressive record, the number of billionaires rose from 13 in 1993 to 24 in 1994 (as compared with one in 1987). So Forbes magazine reported in its annual review of the ""swelling roster of global billionaires"" in the global economy, so short of capital that the great mass of the population must be crushed. The Mexican billionaires achieved their exalted status mostly in league with the state authorities. The biggest gift horse has been ""privatization"": the giveaway of public resources, ""under very generous terms for investors,"" political economist John Summa observes with cautious understatement. Economist David Barkin adds that ""the privatization of Mexico's government holdings was systematically channeled to President Salinas' `cronies,' to use Business Week's expression, in a cynical abuse of the process in which it is rumored that the President himself is a major participant enjoying enormous wealth as a result of his private holdings."" There is also a great inflow of foreign capital, most of it going into ""short-term speculative holdings rather than into directly productive investments.""
In Argentina, also highly praised for its progress under World Bank tutelage, real wages dropped 30 percent since 1980, income inequality increased radically, and ""the social expenditures by the public sector benefit more the upper levels of the social pyramid than the lower levels,"" a confidential World Bank study reported. As in Mexico, the laws of neoliberal science, still as immutable as the principles of gravitation, are functioning as they have throughout history.
Among the developed societies, the top-ranking U.S. client and by far the leading recipient of U.S. aid is Israel, which also has extreme economic inequality (by First World standards). It is increasing under the neoliberal policies of the Labor government. In 1992, the number of families below the poverty line increased by over 14 percent, almost 6 percent more in 1993, now reaching about 650,000 people, 280,000 of them children. The figures include only 45 percent of Palestinian citizens, of whom over a third were below the poverty line. Uncounted also are the poor in agricultural settlements and those considered to be self-employed.19
The consistency is difficult to miss, though not to explain.
Within the ideological system, it is claimed that equality and economic growth are in conflict: we choose one or the other, and our commitment to growth along the lines pioneered by our hero Adam Smith has the unfortunate consequence of engendering inequality, though all ultimately gain as wealth increases. There are a few problems with the theory. One is that equality is a significant factor contributing to growth, as is conceded even by the World Bank, despite its dedication to anti-egalitarian policies. Another is that the model that U.S. leaders have imposed abroad, and seek to duplicate as far as possible here, has led to extreme misery and impoverishment even after long ""experiments"" -- a rather consistent effect of the ""experiments"" conducted by the masters, over centuries. A third problem is that the hero at whose shrine we worship would have been appalled by the argument. A pre-capitalist thinker with roots in the Enlightenment, Smith based his argument for markets on the belief that under ""perfect liberty"" there would be a natural tendency towards equality, a condition for efficient market function. One can hardly say that his argument has been empirically refuted, given the extreme remoteness of ""really existing capitalism"" from liberty, as understood by classical liberalism.20
A symbolic expression of the disaster for families is the fate of the International Convention on Rights of the Child, adopted by the United Nations in November 1989 and ratified by 162 countries, but not the United States -- though for fairness we should add that contemporary conservatism is catholic in its anti-child spirit. A decade ago the World Health Organization voted 118 to 1 to condemn the Nestle corporation's aggressive marketing of its infant formula in the Third World. Well aware of the likely toll in infant disease and death, the Reagan White House cast the sole negative vote, leading the way in the noble cause of free market capitalism and family values.21
Another symbolic expression is a new line of Hallmark Greeting Cards. One, to be placed under a cereal box in the morning, reads: ""Have a super day at school."" Another, placed on the pillow at night, says: ""I wish I were there to tuck you in."" Parents aren't home, one effect of the ""anti-child, anti-family spirit"" engendered by double-edged ""conservatism.""
In part, the disaster for families and children is a direct consequence of falling wages. For much of the population, both parents have to work 50-60 hours a week merely to provide necessities. And the elimination of ""market rigidities"" means that you work extra hours at lower wages -- or you may watch your children starve: all strictly voluntary, of course, in our free society. It doesn't take a genius to predict the consequences, and the statistics show them. Stanford University economist Victor Fuchs estimates that U.S. children have lost 10-12 hours of parental time per week between 1960 and 1986. Total contact time dropped 40 percent in the past generation, leading to deterioration of parent-child relations and family identity and values; increased reliance on TV for child supervision; ""latchkey children"" with rising child alcoholism, drug use, and criminality; violence by and against children; and other obvious effects on health, education, and ability to participate in a democratic society -- even survival.
The conservative war against children and families is taking on a still more bitter cast with the reduction of government support for low-income housing, which declined 80 percent in real terms from 1979 to 1988, becoming ""the main cause of an acute housing shortage that now stretches across the nation,"" Hewlett observes. The U.S. is also unusual among developed societies in not providing health care for mothers; about half of the 40,000 deaths of infants before their first birthday is attributed to lack of adequate prenatal care, more difficult to obtain today than in 1975. The U.S. ""is unique in its lack of provision for childbirth,"" Hewlett continues, one reason why infant mortality rates are so much lower elsewhere. Rights and benefits for working parents when a child is born are also sharply restricted as compared with other rich nations. Approximately 30 percent of babies in the U.S. and 20 percent in Britain ""are deprived of that precious time"" that most specialists assume to be ""the minimally adequate period of time for a parent to bond with a new child."" Lack of job protection after childbirth is ""a large part of the reason why working mothers in the United States lose from 13 to 20 per cent of their earning power after giving birth to a first child,"" a catastrophe for many parents in an era of falling wages, benefits, and security, and ever more onerous work demands. Day care and pre-school arrangements are also minimal by comparative standards.
But things are sure to improve now that Mr. Family Values is in charge. Gingrich has not yet announced legislation to authorize state kidnapping of children of the undeserving poor for placement in orphanages, but he will ""reaffirm the importance he places on family life,"" he said, by forming a committee that will include children and spouses of some House members ""to figure out a legislative schedule more compatible with family life.""22
Some of the consequences of the war against children and families do receive a huge amount of attention, in a most enlightening way. As the 1994 election approached, major journals were lavishing attention on several new books expressing deep concern over (alleged) declines of IQ and scholastic achievement. The New York Times devoted an unusually long lead article in the weekly book review to several books on the topic, primarily the The Bell Curve by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray, a book that is ""being seriously compared"" to Darwin's Origin of Species, a reviewer in Forbes magazine breathlessly proclaimed. The Times reviewer was its science writer Malcolm Browne, who opens by warning that a ""government or society that persists in sweeping their subject matter under the rug will do so at its peril."" There is no mention of the UNICEF study (nor have I seen one elsewhere); or of any of the numerous studies that deal with the war against children and families waged under the banner of conservatism and family values.
What, then, is the question that we ignore at our peril? It turns out to be quite narrow. IQ is claimed to be genetically determined in significant measure, which will lead to a ""hereditary meritocracy""; and still more ominous, linked to race, with the less intelligent breeding like rabbits and fouling the gene pool. Perhaps Black mothers don't nurture their children because they ""evolved in the warm but highly unpredictable environment of Africa,"" the author of one of the books reviewed suggests. This is real hard science, which we ignore at our peril. But we may -- indeed must -- ignore the social policies based on free markets for the poor and state protection for the rich -- the fact, for example, that in the city where such articles appear, the richest in the world, 40 percent of children now live below the poverty line, with little hope of escape from misery and destitution. Could that have something to do with measures of IQ and achievement, or the other consequences of the war against children and families discussed in many unmentionable studies? Such questions we may readily ignore: a natural decision by the rich and powerful, addressing one another and seeking justifications for the class war they are conducting and its human effects.23
The intensity of the effort to lend credibility to the preferred conclusions, particularly on the part of those who profess to be appalled by them, is an intriguing phenomenon. The editors of the Times Book Review, mostly committed liberals no doubt, selected three books on science in their annual list of ""Best Books"" for 1994, all devoted to a single science. The choices were so obvious that there was little dispute, they report. ""The science is, broadly, evolutionary biology or specifically, sociobiology, which, once it gets into your brain, can really spook you about genetics."" What ""spooks you"" is human sociobiology, not the study of complex molecules and ants, about which science actually has something to say.24
One choice is a memoir by Edward Wilson, ""one of the founders of sociobiology"" with ""his seminal 1975 book `Sociobiology'"" -- which has interesting material on simpler organisms, and ends with a few pages of speculations on human sociobiology. The field was actually founded 85 years earlier by the leading anarchist thinker Peter Kropotkin, also a natural scientist, in seminal work that led to his classic Mutual Aid: a Factor of Evolution, published in 1902. His studies criticized the conclusions on ""struggle for existence"" drawn by the noted Darwinian T.H. Huxley, who never responded publicly, though in private he wrote that Kropotkin's prominently-published work was ""very interesting and important."" Kropotkin's Darwinian speculations about the possible role of cooperation in evolution, with their implications for anarchist social organization, remain about as solid a contribution to human sociobiology as exists today. But somehow this work has not entered ""the canon""; one can hardly imagine why.25
The editors' second choice is Robert Wright's Moral Animal, which relies on ""the science of evolutionary psychology"" in an effort to show that ""the source of human morality is genetic."" The general thesis is sure to shock anyone who thought that humans are indistinguishable from rocks and birds. Specific versions of the thesis could be interesting and important, though what evolutionary psychology has to say of any substance would hardly ""spook"" any rational reader.
The most illuminating of the choices of the editors is the one they list first: Steven Pinker's Language Instinct, ""which seems to doom the liberal notion that human behavior can be made better by improvements in culture and environment,"" a frightening conclusion indeed. What exactly is it that ""dooms the liberal notion"" that culture and environment influence behavior? The book reviews evidence supporting the thesis that the capacity for human language appears to be a species-property in essentials, surprisingly independent of other cognitive abilities, and a common human possession over a very broad range. As for the use of these apparently common human abilities, nothing is known beyond environmental factors (you speak English or Japanese, etc.). It is hardly in doubt that such factors also lead to striking differences in ability to make use of the abilities with which we are genetically endowed, though again, it would surprise no sane person if some genetic factor were discovered that has a detectable effect in distinguishing me from a poet -- or violinist, or quantum physicist, or auto mechanic, or anyone with skills I lack. How the editors draw their conclusions from work that offers them no particle of support, indeed undermines them to the extent that anything is understood, they unfortunately do not tell us.
Also intriguing is the way the editors seek to buttress their imaginative constructions. The book, they say, ""gathers data from many fields -- including cognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology and speech therapy -- to demonstrate that the roots of language are in our genes,"" which again will come as a great shock to everyone who thought that humans were indistinguishable from rocks and birds. The author places this conclusion ""firmly...in the framework of Darwinian natural selection,"" which has nothing to say about the topic: simply try to draw some conclusion about language from the theory. The other subjects mentioned, particularly developmental psychology, do make a contribution, but the evidence comes overwhelmingly from linguistics, as the book makes clear. That, however, lacks the proper panache for the ideological purposes at hand.
It's hardly necessary to review once again the misrepresentation and elementary fallacies in the work on IQ that we ignore ""at our peril,"" exposed years ago when the game became popular and now repackaged for today's purposes -- always eliciting much praise for the courage of the authors in lining up with the powerful and ""breaking the censorship"" imposed by the radical extremists who run the universities and the press. Even if we grant every factual conclusion for which some shred of evidence is claimed, nothing of interest follows, except on assumptions that reflect ideological fanaticism, not science. Specifically, the topic of ""meritocracy"" is not even addressed unless we grant the tacit assumption that there is something ""meritorious"" about the particular array of traits, perhaps partially inherited (though nothing relevant is known), that confer power and prestige under particular social arrangements: in some societies, a penchant for torture and murder; in ours, some combination of greed, cynicism, obsequiousness and subordination, lack of curiosity and independence of mind, self-serving disregard for others, and who knows what else, as reflected quite vividly by income distributions and the contributions to society at the high end.
These trivialities aside, one striking finding of the studies reviewed is how poorly IQ correlates with socioeconomic status, possibly a consequence of the fact that it is designed to measure academic success, which is probably correlated only weakly with whatever it is that leads to wealth and privilege under the particular conditions of state capitalist society. If the real factors were studied, possibly better measures could be designed.
One conclusion drawn is that IQ is heritable; according to Bell Curve author Charles Murray, 60% heritable, which means that ""60 percent of the I.Q. in any given person"" is ""heritable."" Murray's statement is meaningless, but presumably he is intending to convey the idea that 60 percent of the I.Q. of a particular individual is determined by the genes. Many others have drawn the same conclusion, based on an elementary error that has been repeatedly pointed out, among others, by Robert Wright. He correctly observes that a trait can be highly heritable whatever its genetic component; say, 100% heritable with no genetic component (whatever that means exactly; it is not a clear notion of biology). To borrow an example from Ned Block, ""some years ago when only women wore earrings, the heritability of having an earring was high because differences in whether a person had an earring was due to a chromosomal difference, XX vs. XY."" No one has yet suggested that wearing earrings, or ties, is ""in our genes,"" an inescapable fate that environment cannot influence, ""dooming the liberal notion.""
The case for group differences is no stronger, not that it would matter in a non-racist society were it true. Take the famous 15 percent deficiency in Black I.Q., which results from some interaction of genetic endowment and environment. About genetic factors that might conceivably be involved, science knows nothing. About environments, a good bit is known, in particular, about the effects of adverse and supportive environments, from the pre-natal stage on. In the absence of any relevant information about unknown genetic factors, or any serious way to measure how such factors (were they to exist, and become known) might interact with environmental conditions, the evidence presented in the Bell Curve is entirely compatible with the conclusion that IQs of Blacks are 15 points higher than those of Whites, or any other number one prefers on ideological grounds. Furthermore, still accepting all the factual claims, nothing follows about long-term social tendencies unless we assume that the natural state of a person is to vegetate, unless driven by transmittable material reward.26
As for Malcolm Browne's great fears, they are readily alleviated. Suppose again we grant the most ominous facts he conjures up about decline of IQ and achievement, and its causes. There's an easy solution to the problem: simply bring here millions of peasants driven from the countryside in China under the ""reforms,"" and radically reduce Browne's income and that of his friends and associates, making sure to deprive their daughters of opportunities and education, while Black mothers are placed in Manhattan high rises and granted every advantage. Then the Asian influx will raise the IQ level; and as serious inquiry demonstrates, the fertility rate of Blacks is very likely to drop while that of the children of the journalistic elite, Harvard psychology professors, and associates of the American Enterprise Institute will rapidly rise. The problem is solved; there is nothing to fear.
In part I of this series, last month, I quoted two medical researchers on the well-known fact that ""development of the brain is strongly influenced by the quality of the nourishment and nurturance given to infants and children,"" among other effects of ""adverse environments"" early in life that can lead ""to permanent defects in memory and learning."" The scale and character of such effects is scarcely understood, but there are all too many illustrations. The UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FA0) predicts that ""Nicaragua's next generation will be smaller, weaker, and less intelligent than today's population,"" Oxfam reports. Is that a sudden genetic malady? Or the effects of policies designed by people at the peak of the income distribution, exercising the high intellectual and moral standards of the ""meritocracy""? Those too are questions that we may readily ignore.27
The only interesting question about the fascination with these topics is what function it serves, a question that is -- again -- not to hard to answer.
These are some of the uglier forms of population control. In the more benign variant, the rabble are to be diverted into harmless pursuits by the huge propaganda institutions, half-American, which spend hundreds of billions of dollars a year to convert people into atoms of consumption and obedient tools of production (when they are lucky enough to find work) -- isolated from one another, lacking even a conception of what a decent human life might be. That's important. Normal human sentiments have to be crushed; they are inconsistent with an ideology geared to the needs of privilege and power, which celebrates private profit as the supreme human value, demands that all submit to ""economic laws,"" except for the wealthy, who merit special protection and care from the powerful state that they control -- a truism to Adam Smith, a ""Marxist obscenity"" in the intellectual world concocted by the self-styled ""cognitive elite"" today.
I'll return in the next installment to more general commentary on background for the rollback crusade, its prospects, and the internal problems it faces.
Rollback, Part III
April, 1995
1. The virtual collapse of civil society
In sections I and II (Jan., Feb.), I reviewed the latest phase of the assault on democracy and human rights that has been been gaining force for some 20 years, entering a new phase with the congressional elections of November 1994. This ""landslide victory for conservatism"" is supposed to have afforded Newt Gingrich's army an overwhelming ""popular mandate"" for the programs of their Contract with America. The mandate reached 17% of eligible voters. In the decisive House vote, 1/3 of the electorate took part, a bare majority voting for Republicans (51.3% of actual voters). The opinion profiles of the 2/3 who stayed away are virtually indistinguishable from those of Democratic voters on major issues. Only a quarter of the population had heard of the Contract a month after the election, rising to 45% after four months of intensive post-election coverage. By then, 55% had an opinion about the Commander-in-Chief of the victorious army; of those, 22% had a favorable opinion, less than half the approval for the much-disliked President, though his ratings increased through February as the highly unpopular Contract was being implemented.1
Nonetheless, fabricated landslides and mandates aside, there is no doubt that the assault against democracy and rights has accelerated, in ways that are significant and ominous. And one cannot take too much comfort from the radical opposition between attitudes and policies. The facts are known only to those who read the small print, and an impression of overwhelming support is being conveyed. The effects will be to change individual attitudes that receive no social support; few want to stand ""alone against the popular will."" With the virtual collapse of civil socity and the lack of a significant organized counterforce, the ""mandate"" that is fabrication today is likely to be reality tomorrow.
In announcing the Clinton Doctrine in late 1993, National Security Adviser Anthony Lake borrowed some standard Cold War terminology, announcing a transition from containment of the ""global threat to market democracies"" to enlargement of ""their reach."" The Cold War term for enlargement was rollback, official policy from 1950. The new doctrine, then, continues the old. Throughout the Cold War, the domestic populations of the industrial societies, including the United States, were a prime target for ""containment."" The doctrinal framework does correspond to historical reality, but only under familiar translations. ""Democracy"" is to contained, restricted to ""top-down forms"" that keep ""traditional structures of power"" intact at home and abroad, as the more candid acknowledge. Politics must remain ""the shadow cast on society by big business,"" to borrow John Dewey's formulation of Adam Smith's truisms about ""the principal architects of policy."" As for ""markets,"" what will be ""enlarged"" is the traditional double-edged doctrine: market discipline for the poor and weak, state protection and intervention (in the economy, and the world) for the benefit of those who cast the shadow -- ""the masters of mankind,"" in Smith's phrase.
Restating the Doctrine without equivocation, the masters have long sought to contain popular struggles to expand the range of meaningful democracy and human rights, but now perceive that they can do better. They feel, perhaps rightly, that they can dismantle the social contract that has been in some measure achieved, rolling back the threat posed by the ""great beast"" that keeps trying ""to plunder the rich"" (Alexander Hamilton and John Foster Dulles, speaking for a host of others). The architects of policy can move on to establish a utopia of the masters based on the values of greed and power, in which privilege is enhanced by state power and the general population lack rights apart from what they can salvage on a (highly flexible) labor market. They are also free to starve or to enter the rapidly expanding workhouse prisons.
""Tough Love""
The Wall Street Journal's review of economic performance for the last quarter of 1995 is headlined: ""Companies' Profits Surged 61% on Higher Prices, Cost Cuts."" After-tax profits rose 62% from 1993, up from 34% for the third quarter. In a full-page ad, a leading lender, the CIT Group, announced proudly that ""Corporate America Posted Record Profits In 1994."" The headline in Business Week read: ""It Doesn't Get a Lot Better than This."" Its survey estimated profits to be up ""an enormous 41% over ,"" despite a bare 9% increase in sales, a ""colossal success,"" resulting in large part from a ""sharp"" drop in the ""share going to labor,"" though ""economists say labor will benefit -- eventually."" The masters aren't fooled.
1993 had been a banner year for business with ""dazzling"" profits for the Fortune 500 despite stagnant sales growth. 1994 was a great improvement, yielding ""surging profits"" that were ""overflowing the coffers of Corporate America,"" Business Week exulted even before the grand news about the final quarter was in. Meanwhile median wages and work conditions continued their steady decline. The number of children under 6 living in poverty reached a record high of 6 million, 26 percent of that age group, an increase of 1 million from 1987 to 1992 and almost double the figures for 1972 when the rollback crusade was in its early stages.2
It therefore follows as night follows day that social policies must be modified to enrich the suffering masses of Corporate America still further while the rest are taught stern lessons about the rigors of this ""lean and mean"" age. And so we see day-by-day as the story unfolds.
The President's first response was to increase the Pentagon budget, the leading form of welfare for the rich. Unaware of the ""mandate"" it has conferred, the public is strongly opposed. Military spending is ""near the bottom of the public's wish list,"" Washington Post polling director Richard Morin observes, with only 1/6 favoring an increase (in contrast, about 2/3 favored more spending on education, drug addiction programs, the environment, and other social spending which is to be sharply cut). In real dollars, the Pentagon budget is $30 billion a year higher than under Nixon, at about 85% of the Cold War average. The Cold War enemy is, of course, now an ally, even in military production: thus its advanced research programs enabled the U.S. to regain the world lead in pulsed power and microwave weaponry, the prestigious military journal Jane's Defence Weekly reported in January. The figures give some indication of how large ""the threat to market democracy"" posed by the Great Satan loomed in the eyes of planners who sought to ""contain"" it and ""roll it back.""3
The Republican majority in Congress was not satisfied with this radical opposition to the public will, particularly the Speaker of the House, who represents the Lockheed Corporation and other high tech industries and has had unparalleled success in using the federal government to transfer public funds to his wealthy constituents. Under his leadership, the House approved a $3.2 billion ""emergency"" supplement for the starving Pentagon. The funds are to be drawn from programs for the vast majority. In a vain and pallid gesture that highlights what is at issue, House Democrats proposed in committee to replace a planned $5-$7 billion of cuts in child nutrition, housing, and job training by a five-year delay in deployment of Lockheed F-22 advanced fighters, a welfare program now estimated at $72 billion. The suggestion was summarily rejected, and scarcely reported.
The word to use remains ""security,"" not ""subsidy,"" as Air Force Secretary Stuart Symington advised in the early days of the Cold War, when government was being mobilized as the ""savior"" of private power, which could not survive in a competitive economy, as the business press frankly acknowledged. And once again, current plans for ""defense"" are designed so as to foster security threats. A minor one is the Soviet Union; though now an ally, it remains a potential threat to U.S. ""preponderance,"" the currently fashionable term for global rule. But the primary threat is ""Third World weapons proliferation,"" Air Force Director of Science and Technology General Richard Paul informed Jane's. We must maintain military spending and strengthen the ""defense industrial base"" because of ""the growing technological sophistication of Third World conflicts,"" the Bush Administration had explained to Congress while watching the Berlin Wall collapse, taking with it the most efficient pretext for ""subsidy."" No one who has kept their eyes on the ""security system"" will be surprised to learn that both threats are to be enhanced.
Some of the funding for the emergency Pentagon supplement is to be drawn from programs to help dismantle and safeguard the nuclear arsenals of the former USSR. To protect ourselves from the resulting threat, we will have to ""increase the Defense Department's budget,"" Florida Democratic Representative Pete Peterson commented. Furthermore, ""Third World weapons proliferation"" is to be stimulated, with new contributions to its ""growing technological sophistication."" The U.S. share in arms sales to Third World countries has reached almost three-quarters. We must therefore provide them with even more advanced weaponry, so that we can tremble in proper fear. Sale of F-16 aircraft with taxpayer-subzidized loans allows the Air Force to pay Lockheed to upgrade the aircraft and to develop the F-22 to counter the threat they pose. The welfare programs extend beyond Gingrich country, General Paul emphasized, outlining the commitment ""to spin dual-use  outside the military"" in ""the national interest,"" ""enhancing our economic security."" Particularly ""enhanced"" is the welfare of corporate America, which is to ""transition our work,"" General Paul continued in standard bureaucratese.
Gingrich's favorite cash cow understands the scam perfectly. Lockheed propaganda warns that it is a ""dangerous world"" in which ""sophisticated fighter airplanes and air defense systems are being sold"" -- mostly by its ""savior."" One of the authors adds: ""We've sold the F-16 all over the world; what if  turns against us?"" To fend off that threat, we have to sell potential adversaries still more advanced weapons, and to transfer still more public funds to the shrinking sectors of the population that bear the burden of ""dazzling"" profits. Quite simple, really.
Arms sales to undemocratic countries -- virtually all the recipients -- are opposed by a mere 96 percent of the population, so these programs reflect the ""popular mandate"" even better than their companions.4
The National Security State is a natural favorite of the advocates of private tyrannies. The device facilitates the transfer of public funds to advanced industry and to wealthy sectors generally, with the public cowering in fear of foreign enemies so that planners can operate in ""technocratic insulation,"" in World Bank lingo. Furthermore, the ""great beast"" has to be dealt with somehow, and the natural device is to frighten them. With internal enemies as well; it is only reasonable that the directors of the Contract should expand further the domestic security system organized and conducted by the powerful state they wish to nurture, passing legislation permitting warrantless searches (considered a ""bad idea"" by 69% of those who conferred ""the mandate"").5
While the important people are receiving the care they deserve from their nanny state, social programs are being radically cut. Here the word to use is not ""security,"" but ""welfare dependence."" The poor are to be helped to escape this grim fate, imposed upon them by a failed liberalism. The only problem with the story is the facts. As discussed in earlier articles, official ""welfare"" has sharply declined. The average monthly benefit level dropped from $714 in 1970 to $510 in 1980 and $394 in 1993 (1995 dollars), Marc Breslow observes. The one exception is health care for the poor (Medicaid), which has risen (though more slowly than general health care costs) in large part as a result of the gross inefficiencies of the privatized system with its huge administrative and bureaucratic burdens, public funding of profits, salaries, and advertising, and now micromanagement of doctors to ensure minimal care and transfer of choice from doctor and patient to fat cats in insurance company offices.
The correlation between welfare payments and family life is real, though it is the reverse of what is claimed. As support for the poor has declined, unwed birthrates, which had risen steadily from the 1940s through the mid-1970s, markedly increased. ""Over the last three decades, the rate of poverty among children almost perfectly correlates with the birthrates among teenage mothers a decade later,"" Mike Males points out: ""That is, child poverty seems to lead to teenage childbearing, not the other way around."" As discussed in part II of this series, the dramatic impact of the war against children and families by Reagan-Thatcher ""conservatives"" has been well studied, but equally well concealed.6
Facts are irrelevant when there is serious business at hand: right now, intensified class war. Among the programs targeted for elimination or radical reduction are school lunches, job training, education generally, assistance to homeless and veterans, fuel and health care for the needy, drug-free schools, conversion of military industry to human needs -- and generally, anything that might help the undeserving majority. That's doubtless in response to the fact that about 80% of the population think ""government has a responsibility to try to do away with poverty,"" up from 70% when the ""great society"" programs were initiated 30 years ago, to enter into sharp decline shortly after.7
Representative Clay Shaw, Chair of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, explained that the proposals to punish millions of poor children are really ""tough love,"" a compassionate effort to save them from dependence on the dole. The programs do not pass without criticism. New York Times reporter David Rosenbaum observes that ""however worthy the goals and however sensible the principles"" that inspire ""tough love,"" these efforts to raise up the poor and needy face ""seemingly intractable contradictions"" -- primarily impediments of the kind just reviewed, which remain unmentioned.8
Jingoism is also in style. Clinton agrees that the U.S. must lower its share of UN peacekeeping operations but his right-wing adversaries want to go much further, shackling or even ending them. As for the irrelevant public, well over 80% favor UN peacekeeping operations. Half consistently support U.S. participation, 88% if there are fair prospects of success; 5-10% consistently oppose such operations, the remainder varying with circumstances. The effect of fatalities in Somalia was slight. Asked their general reaction if dead American soldiers were shown on TV, 57% favored increasing U.S. forces or striking back. Two-thirds favored contributing U.S. troops to a UN operation to protect ""safe havens"" or to stop atrocities in Bosnia; 80% took the same position with regard to Rwanda, if the UN concluded that genocide was underway.9
Along with ""security"" and ""welfare dependence,"" the magic words include ""devolution"" and ""states' rights."" Programs that might help people are not only to be cut, but also handed over to the states in block grants. Under conditions of relative equality, this could be a move towards democracy. Under existing circumstances, devolution is intended as a further blow to the eroding democratic processes. Major corporations, investment firms, and the like, can constrain or directly control the acts of national governments and can set one national work force against another. But the game is much easier when the only competing player that might remotely be influenced by the ""great beast"" is a state government, and even middle-sized enterprise can join in. The shadow cast by business can thus be far darker, and private power can move on to greater victories in the name of freedom; another triviality that appears unworthy of comment.
The Way it Works is described in a lead article in the Boston Globe business section headed ""Line grows longer for state aid,"" putting the ""business-friendly administration"" of Gov. William Weld ""in a bind."" Private enterprises ranging from big-timers like Raytheon, long dependent on the public dole, to sports teams, banks, financial services and insurers, and others, are threatening to move elsewhere unless they receive ""big wage and benefit concessions"" from unions and millions of dollars worth of gifts disguised as ""breaks on taxes and utility bills."" An accompanying story describes how the truly powerful operate. It reports Microsoft magnate Bill Gates's boast that he had delivered an ultimatum to Vice-President Gore warning that he would move the whole operation elsewhere unless Washington settled an anti-trust suit in his favor.10
The richest city in the world, with the help of the state government, hopes to lead the pack. New York Governor Pataki announced a budget plan that will ""reduce the top tax rate 25 percent and save taxpayers $6.8 billion a year,"" the New York Times reported. The first part is true, particularly for the rich; for families with incomes over $150,000, the tax reduction is seven times as high as for those with incomes under $25,000. But the ""savings for the taxpayer"" are a mirage. One such ""saving"" is a cut of $128 million next year in appropriations for the metropolitan area public transit system, tacked on to a $113 million cut in city financing. These ""savings"" will make a 25-cent to 50-cent increase in the already ridiculously high fares ""virtually inevitable,"" transit advocates estimate -- ""a tax hike for the more than four million moderate-income and working people"" of the city, they add correctly, and a huge and radically regressive one. Among other effects, the ""savings"" remove fare reductions for schoolchildren, yet another regressive tax.
Further ""savings to the taxpayer"" include reduction of support and health care for the blind and disabled, children, and defenseless people generally; firing workers who merely provide services to the general public; sharp increases in tuition at city and state universities; cancellation or delay of desperately needed infrastructure repair; doubling up of prisoners in maximum security prisons; and elimination or sharp reduction of the meager assistance to pregnant women on welfare, home care services for the elderly and disabled, pensions, cleanup of Love Canal, assistance for single adults with children ""considered employable"" -- perhaps in the satanic mills that are springing up throughout the city; and on, and on. It will be ""a giant leap toward economic growth,"" the president of the Business Council of New York State exulted, perhaps thinking of those great Caribbean vacations and evenings at luxury restaurants and the theater (deductible as business expenses) and other opportunities that will be afforded by the huge redistribution programs towards the needy rich in a city that has already surpassed Guatemala in the inequality derby.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani lost no time in showing that he too knows how to serve the powerful. ""Embracing the philosophy of Gov. George E. Pataki's austere budget for the state,"" the Times reported, the Mayor will ""reduce for the first time public assistance and health care for the city's poorest residents"" and ""restructure government in ways that would affect virtually every New Yorker, although not evenly"" -- a masterpiece of understatement. ""In addition to the  cuts in welfare and health care,"" the Mayor called on workers to agree to ""savings"" in ""health care, pensions and work rules."" Sanitation services are a prime target. They don't benefit the folks in the high rises, and the effects should not be too much of an annoyance as their limousines pass by decaying trash and rotting people. Also to be cut are assistance to foster parents and preventive services for families considered to pose risks of child abuse. That makes good sense as a component of the war against children and families that has been waged with unremitting intensity by the ""family value"" conservatives in the past 15 years.
In these lean and mean times, it would be unfair to target only the general population. Hence along with sharp reduction of programs that might benefit the general population, there will also be reduction in ""property taxes on coops and condos, as well as reductions in business taxes"" -- so everyone shares in the suffering. Municipal hospitals and health services will close, and public education will deteriorate still further, all ""to stimulate job growth,"" the report continues with a straight face.11
For unexplained reasons, the rising tax burden on poor and working people through fare increases and other regressive measures, though plainly reducing their purchases of goods, does not affect the jobs of those who might otherwise produce them. In contrast, job growth is stimulated by transfer of wealth to the rich for purchase of Mercedes limousines and elegant yachts, rich profits from speculation in the ""economic miracle"" of the Mexican economy (secured by the taxpayer, when it predictably goes sour), shifting of production to semi-slave economies maintained by U.S.-backed violence abroad, and other such free market miracles. The mysteries of economic science are profound indeed.
Not all programs are to be axed, however. One public agency is to receive more money under the Giuliani budget: the police department, which will gain $100 million. That too makes sense, as part of the general enhancement of state power and violence. The rich have to be protected from the effects of the programs to turn New York into a typical Third World city.
At the federal level, some programs are also safeguarded. Over three-fourths of federal food spending goes for food stamps, and that program is slated to keep federal guarantees, for reasons explained quietly by the Wall St. Journal: the food stamp program is backed by ""big agri-business associations,"" so there is no place for ""tough love"" here. ""We want one program at least to be a safety net for people who are truly needy,"" Rep. Pat Roberts of Kansas explained as the House Agriculture Committee that he chairs decided to impose federal requirements for the food stamp program. ""That's the best way to achieve our goals of providing nutrition for the hungry and eliminating fraud from the program,"" Roberts continued. ""It is a more pragmatic approach to achieve several of our goals."" Republicans were ""uneasy"" about block grants that would ""give governors cash rather than give poor people coupons for food,"" the Journal, noting that ""grocery chains and the agribusiness lobby"" were also ""uneasy."" Federal guarantees, in this case, will best preserve ""a safety net for needy people."" The reason for the decision, New York Times reporter Robert Pear added, is that House Republicans ""feared that it would increase fraud and abuse"" if governors were given grants, in this single case. Surely nothing else could have been on their minds -- for example, the fact that Roberts's congressional district received more farm subsidies over the last decade than any other, over $.5 billion a year, with Kansas farmers averaging $20,000 to $30,000 annually. Those are averages; the ""agri-business associations"" mentioned in the small print do not represent small farmers trying to scrape by. The likely outcome will put limits on the program so that it cannot meet the needs of the hungry during periods of economic decline but will offer steady guarantees to agri-business, and leave discretion in the hands of states, so that local powers can determine who are the ""worthy poor"" -- not including mothers who merely care for children, refusing to ""work.""
Much as in totalitarian states, satirists are given greater latitude to articulate what everyone knows. In the Boston Globe, the text of a Steve Wasserman cartoon reads: ""We planned to eliminate food stamps, but then we took pity. We couldn't bear the hungry cries, the outstretched hands of agribusiness lobbyists.""12
One must admire the delicate touch of the statist reactionaries fine-tuning the transfer programs. Unlike food stamps, the Women, Infants and Children (WIC) program is to be turned over to states as block grants. One reason is again explained by the Wall Street Journal. This transfer repeals a ""cost-containment competitive bidding measure"" that placed onerous market conditions on the four pharmaceutical companies that sell infant formula. They ""stand to gain as much as a billion dollars"" a year over and above the successes of their evasions of the federal law, now being investigated by the Federal Trade Commission. Note that taxpayers will save money with the FTC investigation terminated. The new protection for the rich from market discipline should overcome other defects of the WIC program. A USDA study found that every dollar spent brought up to $3.90 reduction of Medicaid costs for newborns and mothers. It also found a 22% drop in neonatal deaths among WIC participants. The effects of restriction of the program and transfer of its benefits to pharmaceutical companies are obvious without comment, among them, the mental and physical harm to surviving children of low-income pregnant women deprived of sustenance, which will improve the grim bell curve that condemns all but the ""cognitive elite"" to servitude, as yet another ""science"" shows.13
Malnourished neonates and children deprived even of school lunches have no lobby working for them. Nor do the great majority of the population. Over 80 percent of the population say that ""working people"" have too little influence, but the shadow cast by business ensures that they can do nothing about it except watch in dismay and unfocused anger as they sink into decline. Unlike the peasants and slum-dwellers of Haiti, who were able to create a civil society rich and vibrant enough to establish a functioning democracy, people here are lost and hopeless -- a fact that sheds light on the standard propaganda line that we have to teach democracy to Haitians. But although 80% feel that working people have too little influence, only 20% feel that way about labor unions while twice that number feel that unions have too much influence. These figures reflect yet another remarkable victory for corporate propaganda.14
The human consequences of the ""savings"" are immediate. Take elimination of home heating aid for the poor, which had reached over 5 million households. 72% have incomes below $8000 and spend over 18% of that on energy costs (4% for average middle-class families). Even with federal aid, half the families had used up the allocation before Christmas in 1993, and by mid-January, twice as many had died from the cold wave as in the Los Angeles earthquake. Boston City Hospital researchers found that among children treated in the emergency room (the ""national health service"" for the poor), the percentage suffering malnutrition almost doubled in the winter. The new measures will not only harm or kill more children, but are also a useful blow to communities. The oil vendors working with the program were mostly small businesses, often multilingual community people. So the threat of democracy is rolled back another notch.15
Another target is public broadcasting, financially trivial but an important part of the campaign to mobilize some public support by a show of ""populism"" on the part of those who are happily grinding the public under foot. The propaganda campaign to depict the public system as ""liberal"" and ""elitist"" is familiar. It is unclear whether it has had much effect. A recent poll finds that over 3/4 of the population want to keep the limited public funding. But the idea that any element of the information system might remain within a potentially democratic system has always been galling to the totalitarian mentality, so despite its marginality, it may disappear.16
Also slated for demolition is the regulatory apparatus, which only protects health, safety, welfare, and lives -- now and for future generations. The measures proposed carry more immediate costs: ""at least $250 million annually"" to enforce the complex provisions, the Congressional Budget Office estimates, largely to pay more bureaucrats. Clinton is joining the parade. His plans to rescind legislation that prevented banks from relying on federally-guaranteed funds for speculation were wonderfully timed. This proposal for ""eliminating the legal and regulatory barriers among financial industries"" was announced in a front-page New York Times story alongside the news that even the strict regulatory system of quasi-fascist Singapore had collapsed, destroying Britain's most venerable merchant bank -- a coincidence that is ""ironic,"" the lobbyist for smaller banks observed. These measures are also expected to concentrate extraordinary resources in a small number of super-powerful banks and investment firms, another contribution to ""free markets."" The Barings collapse is just another in a series of recent disasters, including Kidder Peabody, Orange County, Procter & Gamble, Metallgeschaft, and Mexican casino capitalism. The costs will be paid by the usual victims.17
It hasn't been easy for commentators to deal with recent developments. One problem has been to reconcile the concept of a ""popular mandate"" with the unmistakeable fact that the public strenuously opposes it almost every step of the way, and to preserve the doctrine that Congress, like the White House, is dedicated to serving the public good. Richard Berke's February 28 New York Times report, already cited, concedes that the public ""doubts key parts of the G.O.P.'s agenda,"" giving (very partial) evidence, but explains that Congress implements the programs that the public despises ""based on their reading of public sentiment."" Congress has failed to notice what the polls have consistently demonstrated. The doctrinal system permits accusations of imbecility, but not of rational service to dominant powers. Adam Smith's honesty would be damned as a ""conspiracy theory,"" were anyone so bold as to reiterate it.
Some keep trying to conceal the obvious. Thus we find articles with such headlines as ""Poll finds GOP agenda is popular,"" reporting that only 40% of Americans have even heard of the Contract with America and scarcely a third ""approve of Gingrich's performance."" But, the report in the Washington Post continues, some components of the program are ""overwhelmingly popular,"" specifically term limits for Congress, a balanced budget amendment, and welfare reform. Unmentioned is the fact that term limits were quickly shelved; advocacy of a balanced budget declines to small minorities if it entails cuts in social programs, as of course it does; and while the public does oppose ""welfare,"" having been fed wild tales about ""welfare queens,"" it strongly supports increased help for the poor.
Sometimes the facts even appear in stories framed to confirm the official line. A lead front-page story in the New York Times in mid-December informs us that ""Americans Like G.O.P. Agenda."" Reading on, we find data, which show quite the opposite: about 2/3 ""say the Government has a responsibility to take care of the poor"" while a mere 9% support a decrease in ""programs for poor children,"" one of the major planks of the ""G.O.P. Agenda."" On the balanced budget, which is alleged to have overwhelming popular backing, the polls showed that the percentages were 22%, 27%, 30% if cuts are required in spending on education, Medicare, and Social Security, respectively -- as they would of course be. In brief, Americans Dislike G.O.P. Agenda."" The real world, however, quickly disappeared. By the time the balanced budget amendment hit the front pages in late February, the issue had been reduced by government-media fiat to social security, with the crucial issue of general social spending and popular feelings about the matter completely suppressed in favor of meaningless claims that the public favors the amendment (if nothing is touched). The Times correspondent responsible for analysis of the issue, David Rosenbaum, rails about the ""nonsense"" produced by the politicians who are avoiding ""substance,"" and proceeds to avoid the substance entirely, allowing himself only a mention of military spending and social security. Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry explains how hard it was for him to vote against the amendment ""when 80% of the population are saying `Do something'"": namely, don't pass an amendment that will require cuts in soical spending. Without any counterforce to the manufacture of consent, however, image will become reality, and the Republicans should to be able to use the overwhelming public opposition to their actual stand on this issue as a powerful propaganda weapon.
Point-by-point, large majorities oppose specific programs that are being implemented, with rare (and interesting) exceptions. One can only speculate as to how people would react were they to read small items in the Wall St. Journal spelling out the consequences of the GOP ""vow to ease the burden of estate and gift taxes, which they say are especially onerous for small businesses and family farms"" -- and which the top tax official of the Treasury Department calculates will cut over $20 billion in tax receipts in ten years, benefitting about half of 1% of estates -- the richest.18
The problems of reconciling fact with doctrine arise in the international arena as well. It was well-nigh impossible to conceal the fact that the highly-touted Mexican ""economic miracle"" on which the NAFTA propaganda campaign was founded was utter fraud, as was well-known to anyone with even a casual interest in the topic. Recall that this was the ""prize example"" of the miracle of the market according to the World Bank and IMF, the economics profession, the elite media, and other experts. Also difficult to handle is the fact that the U.S. taxpayer is assigned the responsibility of paying off speculators making a mint on the highly risky fraud; they are not expected to pay the costs under ""free enterprise"" any more than their S&L colleagues. To steer through this maze takes some ingenuity. Thus under the headline ""Socializing Risk to Foster Free Markets,"" New York Times thinker Paul Lewis recognizes that the circumstances might lead some ""to be cynical about a mechanism that would effectively provide insurance"" for the rich in case things go wrong, but a more serious look shows that if Mexico had defaulted, the crisis ""might have undermined the free-market-based development model that has become this decade's economic signature tune"" -- for the commissar class, at least. In fact, both the Mexican ""miracle"" for speculators, investors, and a few billionaires milking public resources, and the way the risks were ""socialized,"" are typical examples of ""really existing free markets.""19
Rollback, Part IV
May, 1995
Towards a Utopia of the Masters
The economic crisis for the general population is a global one. In the past 20 years, economic growth has fallen well below the levels of the 1950s and 1960s (which were, to be sure, historically unique). World per capita income fell in 1993 for the fourth straight year, while the unemployment situation, already grim, worsened in most countries. The International Labor Organization (ILO), in its World Employment 1995 report, ""Predicts Rising Global Joblessness,"" the Wall Street Journal reports, noting however that ""many management theorists"" regard the analysis as outdated because ""the whole concept of a job -- steady work at steady pay from the same employer -- must be discarded."" The only major exception to the growing catastrophe of global capitalism is East and Southeast Asia, with the exception of the Philippines -- incidentally, the sole part of the fastest growing economic region of the world that has been under tight U.S. control for a century and (coincidentally) resembles the Latin American disaster area.
Japan's former colonies have resumed the rapid economic growth of the colonial period; though a brutal imperial power, Japan treated its colonies quite differently from the Western norm. Within the region dominated by Japan and the overseas Chinese financial network, states have been powerful enough to organize capital as well as to control labor. Unlike the rest of the South, they have not been encumbered by what economic historian Paul Bairoch calls the most extraordinary myth of ""economic science"": ""It is difficult to find another case where the facts so contradict a dominant theory than the one concerning the negative impact of protectionism,"" he writes, reviewing much of the record though considerably understating the significance of state intervention for the wealthy, because he limits himself to a narrow category of market interferences. The conclusions, of course, have been understood by the architects of policy, which is why they have progressed while those subjected to their whims have suffered.
The official tale is that the Japan-based region is passionately dedicated to markets. We even read that ""talk of labor standards enrages many export-oriented countries in Asia""; the term ""countries"" here refers, for example, to the brutal and corrupt rulers in Indonesia's developmental state, but not to the working people courageously struggling for the right to organize and demanding labor standards. In internal discussion, we find greater honesty. Thus a Federal Reserve report attributes Singapore's economic growth to a domestic ""forced savings"" policy and other state action.1
Unemployment remains higher in Europe than in the U.S., but as the ILO and others observe, that fact has to be placed in the context of the much harsher conditions of work in the United States and the reduced social contract generally. While the U.S. work week is reaching postwar peaks, the battle for a 40-hour week having been lost long ago, in Europe it has fallen to 38-39 hours, with much longer holidays and leaves and more benefits. To take just one case, until 1993 the U.S. was one of the very few countries in the world that did not provide for statutory maternity leave, and its provisions still fall far below the European standard -- in fact below the agreement negotiated by plantation workers in Uganda, which grants male workers seven days of paternal leave. The same picture is revealed by ratification of ILO conventions guaranteeing labor rights. The U.S. has by far the worst record in the Western hemisphere and Europe, with the exception of El Salvador and Lithuania. It does not recognize even standard conventions on child labor and the right to organize.2
The major factors that have led to the global economic crisis are well understood. One is the globalization of production, which has offered the masters tantalizing opportunities. The business press frankly warns the ""pampered Western workers"" that they must abandon their ""luxurious life styles"" and such ""market rigidities"" as contracts, pensions, health and safety in the workplace, and other outdated nonsense, even the very concept of a job. Economists talk of job flow, pointing out that it is hard to estimate -- and also largely beside the point. The threat suffices to force working people to accept employers' demands. The end of the Cold War, returning most of Eastern Europe to its traditional Third World service role, places new weapons in the hands of the rulers, as the business press has reported with unrestrained glee. GM and VW can shift production to the restored Third world in the East, where they can find workers at a fraction of the cost of the ""pampered Western workers,"" meanwhile enjoying high tariff protection and the other amenities that ""really existing free markets"" provide for the rich. The U.S. and U.K. are leading the way in grinding down working people and the poor, but others will follow along, thanks to the globalization of production. Inequality is back to the depression days in the U.S., back to Victorian times in England, though Latin America still wins the prize for worst record in the world, thanks to our kind tutelage over many years.3
As many studies have shown, relative equality is a significant factor in economic growth and improvement in health and living standards. The fact is recognized by the World Bank, but without influencing the policies that it and its IMF associate impose on the Third World, which dramatically increase inequality and undermine other factors that the Bank identifies as essential for growth, notably education and welfare. There is ample historical precedent. For over 200 years, ""experiments"" have been conducted by the powerful following the highest principles of economic science, with startlingly uniform results: benefits for the experimenters and their power base, tragedies for the experimental animals. Right-thinking people, again, are to draw no conclusions.
A second factor in the general crisis is the huge explosion of unregulated financial capital since the Bretton Woods system was dismantled by Richard Nixon and the radical change in its constitution. Daily turnover on foreign exchange markets may be approaching $1 trillion, some estimate. In the early 1970s, about 90% of capital in international exchanges was for investment and trade, 10% for speculation. By 1990, those figures had reversed, and a 1993 estimate is that only 5% is related to ""real economic transactions"" (Wilfried Guth of the Deutsche Bank, who argues further that these processes are undermining free trade, as do others). The consequences were understood early on. In his 1978 presidential address to the American Economics Association, Nobel laureate James Tobin suggested that taxes be imposed to slow down speculative flows, which, if unimpeded, would drive the world towards a low-growth, low-wage economy, with booming profits as well. By now, the point is widely recognized; a commission headed by Paul Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, attributes about half of the 50% decline in growth rates since the early 1970s to the huge growth of currency speculation.4
The world is being moved by state-corporate policy towards a kind of Third world model, with sectors of great wealth, a huge mass of misery, and a large superfluous population, lacking any rights because they contribute nothing to profit-making for the rich.
These developments are commonly attributed to inexorable market forces. Analysts then divide over the contribution of various factors, primarily trade and automation. But the discussion cannot sensibly proceed without recognition of major interferences with markets. Huge state subsidy and intervention have always been required to make trade appear efficient, not to speak of ecological costs imposed on future generations who do not ""vote"" in the market, and other ""externalities"" consigned to footnotes. To mention merely one slight market distortion, a good part of the Pentagon budget has been devoted to ""secure flow of oil at reasonable prices"" from the Middle East, ""overwhelmingly the preserve of the United States"" (Phebe Marr of the National Defense University) -- a contribution to the ""efficiency of trade"" that rarely receives attention, apart from other contributions to ""the health of the economy."" There are plenty of others.
As for automation, it surely contributes to profit at some point, but that point was reached by decades of protection within the state sector, as David Noble has shown. Furthermore, the specific form of automation designed within the state system was often driven by considerations of power more than profit or efficiency; it was designed to deskill workers and subordinate them to management, not because of market principles or the nature of the technology, but for reasons of domination and control.5
Such contributions to private power give further insight into the attractiveness of the military system for modern state capitalism, particularly its appeal to ""conservatives,"" who are commonly in the lead in demanding that markets be undermined for class interests. Reaganite America and Thatcher's England are the primary recent examples -- both paragons of ""conservatism,"" both leaders in expansion of state-subsidized industry. The U.S. case is well-known. As for Thatcher, her blind pursuit of Friedmanite dogmas that were refuted at every turn succeeded in creating the worst crisis for manufacturing industry since the industrial revolution, destroying almost 1/3 of the manufacturing plant within a few years, a fact extensively detailed (and deplored) by actual conservatives, notably Ian Gilmour. Nevertheless, the disaster was somewhat alleviated by the growth of state-subsidized industry. At least in military industry and sale of torture equipment to countries with awful human rights records, England remains a world leader. London is not far behind Washington in its aggressive pursuit of arms sales including such meritorious customers as Saddam Hussein and Suharto, pursuing the shared doctrine expressed by Thatcher's Defense Procurement Minister Alan Clark: ""I don't really fill my mind much with what one set of foreigners is doing to another.""6
Corporate decisions for power rather than simple profit are often reasonable enough as a tactic in relentless class war. Particular choices of technology provide one example. The recent health care debacle is another case in point. Much of U.S. industry would probably gain from a rational public insurance program, which is why it was advocated editorially by Business Week. But it is unwise to allow the general public to realize that government can carry out useful acts. Despite the heavy shadow cast by business, government remains the one system of power and authority that is to some degree under public influence, unlike private tyrannies, which are almost entirely unaccountable. Enhancing their power is worth some sacrifice in profit.
There are other reasons for sacrificing short-run gain. Executives point out to the business press that it is worthwhile to ship manufacturing jobs even to Germany, with its much higher labor costs, so as to facilitate class warfare. A Gillette Corporation executive explains that the company is ""concerned about having only one place where a product is made,"" primarily because of ""labor problems."" Thus if Boston workers strike, Gillette could supply both the European and U.S. markets from its Berlin plant, thereby breaking the strike; and vice versa. It is only reasonable, then, that Gillette should employ over three times as many workers abroad as in the U.S., irrespective of costs. Strikes of critical importance are now underway in Illinois, where Caterpillar and other corporations are attempting to destroy the last vestige of unions. ""Like many US companies, Caterpillar has pursued a business strategy that has nudged American workers away from defiance toward compliance,"" business correspondent James Tyson reports. The strategy includes ""manufacturing at cheaper facilities abroad"" and ""relying on imports from factories in Brazil, Japan, and Europe"" -- and, of course, hiring scabs and temps and relying on the criminal state to refuse to enforce labor laws, a stand raised to principle by the Reaganites,
Such considerations help explain why U.S. corporations are ""creating jobs overseas"" despite the fact that ""a dollar and falling labor costs have made American products increasingly competitive,"" as the Times reports. Overseas investment is rising at twice the rates of exports, and profits corporations earn from production abroad are almost double those from exports. These are natural ways to use the ""dazzling profits"" they reap from ""conservative"" social policies, and the further gains anticipated from the Gingrich Contract.7
Courts too have sometimes been frank about their contributions to the rollback campaign. Denying an appeal by workers who had lost jobs when Ohio plants were moved to states with cheaper labor, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stated accurately that ""States and counties in the United States compete with each other for companies contemplating relocation,"" and labor laws neither ""discourage such relocations"" nor bar closing of unionized plants in favor of ""a nonunion plant in another part of the country or in a foreign country,"" as ""contemplated"" by NAFTA. The Court then explained the background. Congress and the courts ""have made the social judgment, rightly or wrongly, that our capitalistic system, Darwinian though it may be, will not discourage companies from locating on the basis of their own calculations of factors relating to efficiency and competitiveness. The rules of the marketplace govern. By so reflecting commercial interests, the institutions of government serve -- according to current legal and economic theory -- the long-term best interests of society as a whole. That is the basic social policy the country has opted to follow.""
The candor is unusual, though the deception is typical. ""The country"" has ""opted"" for no such course, and it is radically false that ""the rules of the market place govern"" or that the system is ""Darwinian"" (in the intended sense of ""social Darwinism,"" which has little to do with biology) -- except, of course, for the poor and the weak, who are indeeed subjected to these rules by those who cast their usual shadow by means of Congress and the courts.
As for the dedication of ""legal and economic theory"" to ""the long-term best interests of society as a whole,"" perhaps that was best described by Swiss economist Simonde de Sismondi 175 years ago, commenting on the doctrines of the founder of modern economic theory, David Ricardo, who patiently explained that employment was of no consequence to an economy as long as rent and profits, which funded new investment, were in good shape. ""Wealth is everything, men are absolutely nothing?,"" Sismondi replied: ""In truth then, there is nothing more to wish for than that the king, remaining alone in the island, by constantly turning a crank, might produce, through automata, all the output of England."" Others have no further right to be in England, and should go elsewhere, the laws of the new science proclaimed.
The founders of the science were surpassed by none in their devotion to the ""happiness of the people,"" and even advocated some extension of the franchise to this end: ""not indeed, universally to all people, but to that part of them which cannot be supposed to have any interest in overturning the right of property,"" David Ricardo explained, adding that still heavier restrictions would be appropriate if it were shown that ""limiting the elective franchise to the very narrowest bounds"" would guarantee more ""security for a good choice of representatives."" There's an ample record of similar thoughts, and actions, to the present day.8
The internationalization of production puts quite a different cast on contemporary debate about ""American decline."" As a geographical entity, the country is declining in many respects. But the principal architects of policy have quite different interests, as the ""merchants and manufacturers"" did in 18th century England, and make sure that they are ""most peculiarly attended to,"" whatever the effect on others, including their own populations. Nothing fundamental has changed in that regard since Adam Smith's observations, apart from the dedicated zeal of the efforts to suppress the obvious. With these truisms in mind, we should not be surprised to find that while the U.S. role in manufacturing production is declining if we consider the geographical entity, it is holding its own quite nicely if we consider the share in global production of U.S.-based corporations. The same is true of the ""trade deficit."" If we consider international borders, the U.S. has a huge deficit. But when the Commerce Department recalculated, counting profits of U.S. companies abroad as U.S. exports, the deficit turned into a huge surplus: the recalculation was reasonable, the Wall Street Journal explained, because the profits gained abroad ""benefit companies domestically through greater investment and R&D."" The recalculation interprets the words ""United States"" in the terms that matter for the ""principal architects of policy: not the geographical area or its people, but the people who count.9
These remarks barely skim the surface. It's easy to understand the mood of desperation, anxiety, hopelessness and fear that is so prevalent in the world, outside of wealthy and privileged sectors who see the opportunity to achieve at last the kind of power that was out of reach when the democratic distemper infected nation-states and popular forces could mobilize to win human rights and defend them.
""Intractable Contradictions""
Recall the concerns of New York Times reporter David Rosenbaum that ""however worthy the goals and however sensible the principles"" of the Gingrich reformers, their dedication to the poor faces ""seemingly intractable contradictions."" The most important one, scrupulously ignored, is the need to protect the wealthy and powerful from market discipline in traditional ways, now being extended. But there are other problems.
Educated and privileged sectors, reasoning along Ricardo's lines, see little problem in the fact that policies are executed in ""technocratic insulation,"" unimpeded by public interests and concerns. But the population has to be controlled somehow. For obvious reasons, one cannot appeal to them on grounds of the intended effects of the policies that are being implemented. So other methods are required. There are standard devices. Many can simply be locked up or confined to urban slums. Others can be entrapped by artificial ""creation of wants"" or other forms of diversion. They can be left in confusion and despair by corporate and other propaganda, a huge industry in the United States for many years. Or they can be mobilized in fear and hatred -- of foreigners, of one another -- or by religious fundamentalist appeals.
The masters of mankind understand very well that people must not be given opportunities to organize in a functioning civil society, which might enable them to pool limited resources and to take their affairs into their own hands. But when the limited admissible means are used to mobilize people to do such needed work as rolling back the social contract, ""intractable contradictions"" arise. The problems are classic: they were recognized by German industrialists who had supported Hitler's forces as a way to destroy the labor movement, and found -- not to their pleasure -- that he and his followers had some ideas of their own. The Iranian merchants who relied on fundamentalist religious leaders to mobilize the public against the Shah faced the same dilemma shortly after. Some similar ""intractable contradictions"" are arising right now as the rollback campaign gains force.
The problems have troubled the business press. A Fortune cover story is headlined ""Today's GOP: The Party's Over for Big Business."" To mobilize popular forces, the corporate world has been compelled to resort to what are called ""cultural issues."" But its troops are now prepared to fight the ""culture war,"" as Pat Buchanan and others refer to the various forms of fanaticism they are seeking to engender. That process has opened a ""culture gap,"" Fortune observes. The CEOs are generally liberal in cultural attitudes. They don't want their children to be forced to pray in schools or taught ""creation science."" They want their daughters to have opportunities. They not only tend to be pro-choice, but about 60% of CEOs are ""adamantly pro-choice, agreeing with the statement that `a woman should be able to get an abortion if she wants one, no matter what the reason'."" They do not want to live in a society and culture dominated by Christian fundamentalists, people who worship the Enola Gay or run around with assault rifles, or who debate subtle points about Beast 666 from the Book of Revelations and listen to Pat Robertson explaining how Presidents from Wilson to Bush may have been pawns of ""a tightly knit cabal"" run by Freemasons and ""European bankers,"" who seek ""a new order for the human race under the domination of Lucifer."" But these are the sectors they are forced to turn to as a popular base for their assault on democracy and human rights.
Among CEOs, the overwhelming favorite for President is Dick Cheney; Bob Dole and Phil Gramm were backed by a mere 17%, and ""right down at the bottom of the pack with a 3% show of support...was Newt Gingrich."" Unfortunately for them, however, ""The religious right now controls the GOP,"" Fortune comments in bold face: ""Religious conservatives are the single most powerful force within the GOP,"" no small group in one of the world's most extreme religious fundamentalist cultures. They ""hold veto power over the Republican presidential nomination."" ""There's a real cultural disconnect between the FORTUNE 500 and social conservatives,"" a lobbyist ""with strong ties to Christian fundamentalist groups and the new Republicans"" observes.
The Wall Street Journal talks uneasily about ""class warfare"" -- a term usually avoided like the plague in respectable circles -- referring to a war over ""values"" that pits the ""upper-middle class elites of professionals and managers,"" their constituency, against the guy in the street who supports the Republican Party that is supposed to do the bidding of these upper-middle class elites. The religious conservatives who hold ""veto power"" have no great interest in big business, which they rightly see as hostile to the values that they uphold. They gain support from ""a few large companies on the fringe of corporate America -- the tobacco industry, Amway."" But within the functioning economy, they are viewed with no little dismay, apart from their role in implementing the rollback campaign. They oppose government support for big corporations, threatening a disaster for ""free enterprise"" if they cannot be kept down in the trenches. They agree that ""It's rollback time,"" as one of their activists says, but they have in mind something quite different from the CEOs. They don't like it when a corporation that has its home in Gingrich's Cobb County denounces an official resolution condemning ""the gay life style."" The CEOs rightly fear that their troops may move beyond the ""culture war,"" proceeding to undermine the basic framework of state-subsidized private power.
Funding for the Gingrich army reveals the contradictions clearly. Major funders are from marketing schemes like Amway, smaller insurance companies, hedge-funds, and the like. These sectors control plenty of money but are at the fringes of the economy. They are ""very much in sync with the `Contract With America',"" the Wall Street Journal reports, which is true only under a special but perhaps accurate interpretion of the support for the Pentagon on the part of their forces, who, unlike the CEOs, are not much interested in the government's role as the ""savior"" of advanced industry. Furthermore, they come from sectors of the population that really are cringing in fear and terror, seeing enemies coming to get them on all sides, a fact about the extraordinary cultural scene that one cannot simply ignore.10
The contradictions are showing up in Washington. The Commerce Department under Clinton has become ""a pro-business dynamo,"" the Wall Street Journal observes, serving private power to an unprecedented degree. But the Gingrich army doesn't understand, which leads to an ""uncanny circumstance: Big business allied with a Democratic administration against Republic proposals to trim Commerce's sails."" The same is true of the Export-Import Bank, the National Institutes of Health (which have ""given birth to the biotechnology industry,"" the New York Times observes), and the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the Technology Reinvestment Project, Clinton-inspired adjuncts to the Pentagon subsidy to advanced industry. These are wasteful because they are not devoted solely to ""military uses,"" GOP critics charge, failing to comprehend the way the real economy works and perhaps believing the lurid tales about Beast 666, Arab terrorists, and who knows what other agent of Lucifer or the United Nations. Even the hated regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have support from major corporations, which can see ahead far enough to judge the effects of another thalidomide scandal.11
In the early part of this century, there was much fascination with ""corporate entities,"" social ""organisms"" that have unique rights beyond those of mere individuals. These ideas, growing from more or less the same Hegelian intellectual soil, took several forms, notably Bolshevism, fascism, and the modern corporation. Corporations were granted extraordinary rights by Courts and lawyers, often with the support of ""progressives."" They are, furthermore, as totalitarian an institution as humans have managed so far to contrive. Terminology is crafted to avoid the substance behind the shadow, so such terms as ""fascist"" and ""totalitarian"" are restricted to political entities. But the similarity in character is unmistakeable. Two of these systems of centralized, autocratic, and unaccountable power have succumbed. The third not only remains but is increasing its sway and dominance. There are divisions and conflicts of course, but also much similarity of general conception worldwide, and overarching institutions are also taking shape. The internal contradictions may or may not prove ""intractable,"" but they have ominous import however they are resolved.
The transition from containment of democracy and human rights to actual rollback should be seen against this background. We should also recognize that the new phase of the struggle against the ""great beast"" is based upon social policies with particular goals that are not graven in stone or founded in laws of nature or society, any more than the human institutions from which they arise.

Nalimutan kong may naghihintay nga pala sa album ko
I'm sorry, yo, update ko kayo when it's time
At present, hindi pa buo 'yung regalo
Konting tiis pa, meanwhile
Para makabawi, ira-wrap ko muna
Mga nangyari nitong 2020, freestyle, yeah

Nag-quit na ako sa 'king bisyo
Naganap na ang katapusan
'Di na ako nagra-Ragnarok
Sa wakas, DOTA na lang at Valorant
'Twas the reason why I'm hella lowkey like a ghost
Ngayon, 'di ko na kayo gogoyoin, yo
Babalik na ako this year, tama na ang peace, 'tol
'Lalabas ko na rin 'tong Odin ko
(Ba't nilalabas mo 'yung titi mo?)

Nakakaurat
Bakit ba kayo ganyan magsulat?
May balls 'yung pen pero sorry, man
Puro bayag, kakaburat
Nais niyo lang din naman ay bumenta
Kaya puro paninindak
Kaya 'di nirerespeto roots
Kasi kakupalan sa inyo mismo nag-uugat
Mauugat, maaalog
Ang eksena 'pag ako nag-upload
Mati-tilt na naman sa 'kin balance of power
Hindi sapat ang pasaload (nope)
'Di na 'ko babalik sa FlipTop
(Snitched myself to save you time)
Babaliktad lang ang aking utak
'Pag 'yung six ay ginawa mong nine

At hamunin ko rin kaya si A.E?
Feels like I want everyone to hate me
Nawala kasi 'yung gutom ko lately
Mula nu'ng nag-champion nu'ng 2018
'Yung mga tao, biglang nag-180
Sumapi tuloy sa akin si Juan Lazy
Buti na-inspire sa side B ni Shady
He brought back to life
'Yung B side na Shehyee (whoo)

Daming tanga no'n
Mga linyang tumatak, akin mga 'yon
Kahit itanong niyo pa kay Smugg
Sasagutin kayo no'n galing sa ilong
Kung babalikan ang dating panahon
Nabuhat lang ang sabi-sabi noon
'Di kasi alam na ako ang creator
Kaya tawag ng laro sa 'kin (Patapon)
Yah, kahit na gano'n
Wait, ano? Teka muna
Patapon? Creator? Laro?
'Yung sa PSP? 'Di mo nakuha?
'Di kaya mali 'yung aking delivery kaya 'di nakuha?
O masyado nang sinauna?
Anyway, marami nga palang patapon
Sa larong kailangang ibasura

Kailangan ng kalinga ng rap
Kaya mambabatok ako gamit tinta
At kakantiin ko lahat
Wala 'kong paki kahit Titan ka pa
Alam naman ng fans na I'm Levi
Shehyee's a Leviathan, bitch!
Old school, new school, whenever I open my mouth
They'll get devoured like a school of fish
(Oh, 'kala ko sa album ka pa mag-i-English?)
(Ay, sorry, sorry, oo nga pala, game, take two)

Kailangan ng kalinga ng rap
Mambabatok ako gamit tinta
Kaso nga lang hindi ko ma-tag
Puro fake 'yung accounts, ang dami nila
Kaya nga ang hilig pumutak
Nakatago sa dummy, takot magisa sa sariling mantika
Mga ayaw magpakita ng mukha
Palibhasa, mga pangit sila
Mga pangit sila
'Tang ina niyo, mga pangit
Sa totoo lang, 'di ko kayo gustong awayin
Miss ko lang manlait
I'm sorry if I am a dick
Sayang gift at talent, 'di ko nagagamit
My penmanships parang titi
Tumitira tuwing nagagalit

Ang lambot niya ngayon
'Di kasi natsa-challenge
Plan ko pa namang magpaulan
Ng mga linyang may katuwiran, 'di na bali

Higit sa lahat
Sana effective 'yung vaccine
At sana rin matuloy incoming laban
Ni Pacman at McGregor sa boxing
Sana rin dumami pa gumawa
Ng mga track at mag-record sa rap scene
Pero my advice is this
Next year mo release kasi 2021'y akin

I-claim mo agad
Una, angkinin mo tapos pray mo kay God
Basta gawin mo lahat, kung may pumalag
Sampalin mo ng plain na burat (time, time, time, time)
I ain't havin' that
Even Anygma ain't stopping me rap
Even a blackhole, a problem you can't solve
Today, like your traveling pass

'Tang ina, sorry napa-Ingles na naman ako
Nako, nakakainis ka naman, wala sa plano 'to
Pa'no 'pag namintis ka sa ganyan, 'kala mo kaya mo
'Di ako nagmi-miss, pare, ala Mika Daime 'to
Hindi ko natiis, nabanggit ko tuloy pangalan mo
Ngayon alam mo, miss, ang dami naming nagkakagulo
Isa 'ko sa nabwisit sa 'yo sa kadayaan mo
Kung umamin ka, jeez, 'di ka sana nagkakaganto

Pero one of the reason bakit ko sinasabi 'to
Alam ko guys, easy ikondena ang taong 'to
Reminder lang please, 'wag limutin pagkatao niyo
Everyone say, ""Cheese"", tignan mo litrato mo
'Yung points kay Jesus, nababawasan, hay nako
Tama na 'yung diss lalo na sa times na gan'to
Hindi ako divided sa issue, ito'y lesson sa iyo
In addition, pakinggan mo bituin na kanta ko

Kung magaling ka sa mathematic
Gets mo agad mga sinabi ko
One plus one lang, pare ko
Too much na 'yung nangyayari, bro
Sa bibig na lumalabas 'yung tae niyo
Tingin ko din aimbot
Pero masyado nang foul
Andito 'ko kung gusto niyo pa ng trash-talk

Teka, laro muna"
36,183183921,Kung Pwede Lang,Disktrack feat. Cedrick,[15],['R&B/Soul'],"IT MAY NOT BE UNNECESSARY to inform the reader that the following Reflections had their origin in a correspondence between the Author and a very young gentleman at Paris, who did him the honor of desiring his opinion upon the important transactions which then, and ever since, have so much occupied the attention of all men. An answer was written sometime in the month of October 1789, but it was kept back upon prudential considerations. That letter is alluded to in the beginning of the following sheets. It has been since forwarded to the person to whom it was addressed. The reasons for the delay in sending it were assigned in a short letter to the same gentleman. This produced on his part a new and pressing application for the Author's sentiments.
The Author began a second and more full discussion on the subject. This he had some thoughts of publishing early in the last spring; but, the matter gaining upon him, he found that what he had undertaken not only far exceeded the measure of a letter, but that its importance required rather a more detailed consideration than at that time he had any leisure to bestow upon it. However, having thrown down his first thoughts in the form of a letter, and, indeed, when he sat down to write, having intended it for a private letter, he found it difficult to change the form of address when his sentiments had grown into a greater extent and had received another direction. A different plan, he is sensible, might be more favourable to a commodious division and distribution of his matter.
Dear Sir,
You are pleased to call again, and with some earnestness, for my thoughts on the late proceedings in France. I will not give you reason to imagine that I think my sentiments of such value as to wish myself to be solicited about them. They are of too little consequence to be very anxiously either communicated or withheld. It was from attention to you, and to you only, that I hesitated at the time when you first desired to receive them. In the first letter I had the honor to write to you, and which at length I send, I wrote neither for, nor from, any description of men, nor shall I in this. My errors, if any, are my own. My reputation alone is to answer for them.
You see, Sir, by the long letter I have transmitted to you, that though I do most heartily wish that France may be animated by a spirit of rational liberty, and that I think you bound, in all honest policy, to provide a permanent body in which that spirit may reside, and an effectual organ by which it may act, it is my misfortune to entertain great doubts concerning several material points in your late transactions.
YOU IMAGINED, WHEN YOU WROTE LAST, that I might possibly be reckoned among the approvers of certain proceedings in France, from the solemn public seal of sanction they have received from two clubs of gentlemen in London, called the Constitutional Society and the Revolution Society.
I certainly have the honor to belong to more clubs than one, in which the constitution of this kingdom and the principles of the glorious Revolution are held in high reverence, and I reckon myself among the most forward in my zeal for maintaining that constitution and those principles in their utmost purity and vigor. It is because I do so, that I think it necessary for me that there should be no mistake. Those who cultivate the memory of our Revolution and those who are attached to the constitution of this kingdom will take good care how they are involved with persons who, under the pretext of zeal toward the Revolution and constitution, too frequently wander from their true principles and are ready on every occasion to depart from the firm but cautious and deliberate spirit which produced the one, and which presides in the other. Before I proceed to answer the more material particulars in your letter, I shall beg leave to give you such information as I have been able to obtain of the two clubs which have thought proper, as bodies, to interfere in the concerns of France, first assuring you that I am not, and that I have never been, a member of either of those societies.
The first, calling itself the Constitutional Society, or Society for Constitutional Information, or by some such title, is, I believe, of seven or eight years standing. The institution of this society appears to be of a charitable and so far of a laudable nature; it was intended for the circulation, at the expense of the members, of many books which few others would be at the expense of buying, and which might lie on the hands of the booksellers, to the great loss of an useful body of men. Whether the books, so charitably circulated, were ever as charitably read is more than I know. Possibly several of them have been exported to France and, like goods not in request here, may with you have found a market. I have heard much talk of the lights to be drawn from books that are sent from hence. What improvements they have had in their passage (as it is said some liquors are meliorated by crossing the sea) I cannot tell; but I never heard a man of common judgment or the least degree of information speak a word in praise of the greater part of the publications circulated by that society, nor have their proceedings been accounted, except by some of themselves, as of any serious consequence.
Your National Assembly seems to entertain much the same opinion that I do of this poor charitable club. As a nation, you reserved the whole stock of your eloquent acknowledgments for the Revolution Society, when their fellows in the Constitutional were, in equity, entitled to some share. Since you have selected the Revolution Society as the great object of your national thanks and praises, you will think me excusable in making its late conduct the subject of my observations. The National Assembly of France has given importance to these gentlemen by adopting them; and they return the favor by acting as a committee in England for extending the principles of the National Assembly. Henceforward we must consider them as a kind of privileged persons, as no inconsiderable members in the diplomatic body. This is one among the revolutions which have given splendour to obscurity, and distinction to undiscerned merit. Until very lately I do not recollect to have heard of this club. I am quite sure that it never occupied a moment of my thoughts, nor, I believe, those of any person out of their own set. I find, upon inquiry, that on the anniversary of the Revolution in 1688, a club of dissenters, but of what denomination I know not, have long had the custom of hearing a sermon in one of their churches; and that afterwards they spent the day cheerfully, as other clubs do, at the tavern. But I never heard that any public measure or political system, much less that the merits of the constitution of any foreign nation, had been the subject of a formal proceeding at their festivals, until, to my inexpressible surprise, I found them in a sort of public capacity, by a congratulatory address, giving an authoritative sanction to the proceedings of the National Assembly in France.
In the ancient principles and conduct of the club, so far at least as they were declared, I see nothing to which I could take exception. I think it very probable that for some purpose new members may have entered among them, and that some truly Christian politicians, who love to dispense benefits but are careful to conceal the hand which distributes the dole, may have made them the instruments of their pious designs. Whatever I may have reason to suspect concerning private management, I shall speak of nothing as of a certainty but what is public.
For one, I should be sorry to be thought, directly or indirectly, concerned in their proceedings. I certainly take my full share, along with the rest of the world, in my individual and private capacity, in speculating on what has been done or is doing on the public stage in any place ancient or modern; in the republic of Rome or the republic of Paris; but having no general apostolically mission, being a citizen of a particular state and being bound up, in a considerable degree, by its public will, I should think it at least improper and irregular for me to open a formal public correspondence with the actual government of a foreign nation, without the express authority of the government under which I live.
I should be still more unwilling to enter into that correspondence under anything like an equivocal description, which to many, unacquainted with our usages, might make the address, in which I joined, appear as the act of persons in some sort of corporate capacity acknowledged by the laws of this kingdom and authorized to speak the sense of some part of it. On account of the ambiguity and uncertainty of unauthorized general descriptions, and of the deceit which may be practiced under them, and not from mere formality, the House of Commons would reject the most sneaking petition for the most trifling object, under that mode of signature to which you have thrown open the folding doors of your presence chamber, and have ushered into your National Assembly with as much ceremony and parade, and with as great a bustle of applause, as if you have been visited by the whole representative majesty of the whole English nation. If what this society has thought proper to send forth had been a piece of argument, it would have signified little whose argument it was. It would be neither the more nor the less convincing on account of the party it came from. But this is only a vote and resolution. It stands solely on authority; and in this case it is the mere authority of individuals, few of whom appear. Their signatures ought, in my opinion, to have been annexed to their instrument. The world would then have the means of knowing how many they are; who they are; and of what value their opinions may be, from their personal abilities, from their knowledge, their experience, or their lead and authority in this state. To me, who am but a plain man, the proceeding looks a little too refined and too ingenious; it has too much the air of a political stratagem adopted for the sake of giving, under a high-sounding name, an importance to the public declarations of this club which, when the matter came to be closely inspected, they did not altogether so well deserve. It is a policy that has very much the complexion of a fraud.
I flatter myself that I love a manly, moral, regulated liberty as well as any gentleman of that society, be he who he will; and perhaps I have given as good proofs of my attachment to that cause in the whole course of my public conduct. I think I envy liberty as little as they do to any other nation. But I cannot stand forward and give praise or blame to anything which relates to human actions, and human concerns, on a simple view of the object, as it stands stripped of every relation, in all the nakedness and solitude of metaphysical abstraction. Circumstances (which with some gentlemen pass for nothing) give in reality to every political principle its distinguishing color and discriminating effect. The circumstances are what render every civil and political scheme beneficial or noxious to mankind. Abstractedly speaking, government, as well as liberty, is good; yet could I, in common sense, ten years ago, have felicitated France on her enjoyment of a government (for she then had a government) without inquiry what the nature of that government was, or how it was administered? Can I now congratulate the same nation upon its freedom? Is it because liberty in the abstract may be classed amongst the blessings of mankind, that I am seriously to felicitate a madman, who has escaped from the protecting restraint and wholesome darkness of his cell, on his restoration to the enjoyment of light and liberty? Am I to congratulate a highwayman and murderer who has broke prison upon the recovery of his natural rights? This would be to act over again the scene of the criminals condemned to the galleys, and their heroic deliverer, the metaphysic Knight of the Sorrowful Countenance.
When I see the spirit of liberty in action, I see a strong principle at work; and this, for a while, is all I can possibly know of it. The wild gas, the fixed air, is plainly broke loose; but we ought to suspend our judgment until the first effervescence is a little subsided, till the liquor is cleared, and until we see something deeper than the agitation of a troubled and frothy surface. I must be tolerably sure, before I venture publicly to congratulate men upon a blessing, that they have really received one. Flattery corrupts both the receiver and the giver, and adulation is not of more service to the people than to kings. I should, therefore, suspend my congratulations on the new liberty of France until I was informed how it had been combined with government, with public force, with the discipline and obedience of armies, with the collection of an effective and well-distributed revenue, with morality and religion, with the solidity of property, with peace and order, with civil and social manners. All these (in their way) are good things, too, and without them liberty is not a benefit whilst it lasts, and is not likely to continue long. The effect of liberty to individuals is that they may do what they please; we ought to see what it will please them to do, before we risk congratulations which may be soon turned into complaints. Prudence would dictate this in the case of separate, insulated, private men, but liberty, when men act in bodies, is power. Considerate people, before they declare themselves, will observe the use which is made of power and particularly of so trying a thing as new power in new persons of whose principles, tempers, and dispositions they have little or no experience, and in situations where those who appear the most stirring in the scene may possibly not be the real movers.
ALL these considerations, however, were below the transcendental dignity of the Revolution Society. Whilst I continued in the country, from whence I had the honor of writing to you, I had but an imperfect idea of their transactions. On my coming to town, I sent for an account of their proceedings, which had been published by their authority, containing a sermon of Dr. Price, with the Duke de Rochefoucault's and the Archbishop of Aix's letter, and several other documents annexed. The whole of that publication, with the manifest design of connecting the affairs of France with those of England by drawing us into an imitation of the conduct of the National Assembly, gave me a considerable degree of uneasiness. The effect of that conduct upon the power, credit, prosperity, and tranquillity of France became every day more evident. The form of constitution to be settled for its future polity became more clear. We are now in a condition to discern, with tolerable exactness, the true nature of the object held up to our imitation. If the prudence of reserve and decorum dictates silence in some circumstances, in others prudence of a higher order may justify us in speaking our thoughts. The beginnings of confusion with us in England are at present feeble enough, but, with you, we have seen an infancy still more feeble growing by moments into a strength to heap mountains upon mountains and to wage war with heaven itself. Whenever our neighbour’s house is on fire, it cannot be amiss for the engines to play a little on our own. Better to be despised for too anxious apprehensions than ruined by too confident a security.
Solicitous chiefly for the peace of my own country, but by no means unconcerned for yours, I wish to communicate more largely what was at first intended only for your private satisfaction. I shall still keep your affairs in my eye and continue to address myself to you. Indulging myself in the freedom of epistolary intercourse, I beg leave to throw out my thoughts and express my feelings just as they arise in my mind, with very little attention to formal method. I set out with the proceedings of the Revolution Society, but I shall not confine myself to them. Is it possible I should? It appears to me as if I were in a great crisis, not of the affairs of France alone, but of all Europe, perhaps of more than Europe. All circumstances taken together, the French revolution is the most astonishing that has hitherto happened in the world. The most wonderful things are brought about, in many instances by means the most absurd and ridiculous, in the most ridiculous modes, and apparently by the most contemptible instruments. Everything seems out of nature in this strange chaos of levity and ferocity, and of all sorts of crimes jumbled together with all sorts of follies. In viewing this monstrous tragicomic scene, the most opposite passions necessarily succeed and sometimes mix with each other in the mind: alternate contempt and indignation, alternate laughter and tears, alternate scorn and horror.
It cannot, however, be denied that to some this strange scene appeared in quite another point of view. Into them it inspired no other sentiments than those of exultation and rapture. They saw nothing in what has been done in France but a firm and temperate exertion of freedom, so consistent, on the whole, with morals and with piety as to make it deserving not only of the secular applause of dashing Machiavellian politicians, but to render it a fit theme for all the devout effusions of sacred eloquence.
On the forenoon of the fourth of November last, Doctor Richard Price, a non conforming minister of eminence, preached, at the dissenting meeting house of the Old Jewry, to his club or society, a very extraordinary miscellaneous sermon, in which there are some good moral and religious sentiments, and not ill expressed, mixed up in a sort of porridge of various political opinions and reflections; but the Revolution in France is the grand ingredient in the cauldron. I consider the address transmitted by the Revolution Society to the National Assembly, through Earl Stanhope, as originating in the principles of the sermon and as a corollary from them. It was moved by the preacher of that discourse. It was passed by those who came reeking from the effect of the sermon without any censure or qualification, expressed or implied. If, however, any of the gentlemen concerned shall wish to separate the sermon from the resolution, they know how to acknowledge the one and to disavow the other. They may do it: I cannot.
For my part, I looked on that sermon as the public declaration of a man much connected with literary caballers and intriguing philosophers, with political theologians and theological politicians both at home and abroad. I know they set him up as a sort of oracle, because, with the best intentions in the world, he naturally philippizes and chants his prophetic song in exact unison with their designs.
That sermon is in a strain which I believe has not been heard in this kingdom, in any of the pulpits which are tolerated or encouraged in it, since the year 1648, when a predecessor of Dr. Price, the Rev. Hugh Peters, made the vault of the king's own chapel at St. James's ring with the honor and privilege of the saints, who, with the ""high praises of God in their mouths, and a two-edged sword in their hands, were to execute judgment on the heathen, and punishments upon the people; to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron"". Few harangues from the pulpit, except in the days of your league in France or in the days of our Solemn League and Covenant in England, have ever breathed less of the spirit of moderation than this lecture in the Old Jewry. Supposing, however, that something like moderation were visible in this political sermon, yet politics and the pulpit are terms that have little agreement. No sound ought to be heard in the church but the healing voice of Christian charity. The cause of civil liberty and civil government gains as little as that of religion by this confusion of duties. Those who quit their proper character to assume what does not belong to them are, for the greater part, ignorant both of the character they leave and of the character they assume. Wholly unacquainted with the world in which they are so fond of meddling, and inexperienced in all its affairs on which they pronounce with so much confidence, they have nothing of politics but the passions they excite. Surely the church is a place where one day's truce ought to be allowed to the dissensions and animosities of mankind.
This pulpit style, revived after so long a discontinuance, had to me the air of novelty, and of a novelty not wholly without danger. I do not charge this danger equally to every part of the discourse. The hint given to a noble and reverend lay divine, who is supposed high in office in one of our universities,  and other lay divines ""of rank and literature"" may be proper and seasonable, though somewhat new. If the noble Seekers should find nothing to satisfy their pious fancies in the old staple of the national church, or in all the rich variety to be found in the well-assorted warehouses of the dissenting congregations, Dr. Price advises them to improve upon non-conformity and to set up, each of them, a separate meeting house upon his own particular principles. It is somewhat remarkable that this reverend divine should be so earnest for setting up new churches and so perfectly indifferent concerning the doctrine which may be taught in them. His zeal is of a curious character. It is not for the propagation of his own opinions, but of any opinions. It is not for the diffusion of truth, but for the spreading of contradiction. Let the noble teachers but dissent, it is no matter from whom or from what. This great point once secured, it is taken for granted their religion will be rational and manly. I doubt whether religion would reap all the benefits which the calculating divine computes from this ""great company of great preachers"". It would certainly be a valuable addition of nondescripts to the ample collection of known classes, genera and species, which at present beautify the hortus siccus of dissent. A sermon from a noble duke, or a noble marquis, or a noble earl, or baron bold would certainly increase and diversify the amusements of this town, which begins to grow satiated with the uniform round of its vapid dissipations. I should only stipulate that these new Mess-Johns in robes and coronets should keep some sort of bounds in the democratic and levelling principles which are expected from their titled pulpits. The new evangelists will, I dare say, disappoint the hopes that are conceived of them. They will not become, literally as well as figuratively, polemic divines, nor be disposed so to drill their congregations that they may, as in former blessed times, preach their doctrines to regiments of dragoons and corps of infantry and artillery. Such arrangements, however favourable to the cause of compulsory freedom, civil and religious, may not be equally conducive to the national tranquillity. These few restrictions I hope are no great stretches of intolerance, no very violent exertions of despotism.
BUT I may say of our preacher ""utinam nugis tota illa dedisset tempora saevitiae"".  All things in this his fulminating bull are not of so in noxious a tendency. His doctrines affect our constitution in its vital parts. He tells the Revolution Society in this political sermon that his Majesty ""is almost the only lawful king in the world because the only one who owes his crown to the choice of his people."" As to the kings of the world, all of whom (except one) this arch pontiff of the rights of men, with all the plenitude and with more than the boldness of the papal deposing power in its meridian fervour of the twelfth century, puts into one sweeping clause of ban and anathema and proclaims usurpers by circles of longitude and latitude, over the whole globe, it behoves them to consider how they admit into their territories these apostolic missionaries who are to tell their subjects they are not lawful kings. That is their concern. It is ours, as a domestic interest of some moment, seriously to consider the solidity of the only principle upon which these gentlemen acknowledge a king of Great Britain to be entitled to their allegiance.
This doctrine, as applied to the prince now on the British throne, either is nonsense and therefore neither true nor false, or it affirms a most unfounded, dangerous, illegal, and unconstitutional position. According to this spiritual doctor of politics, if his Majesty does not owe his crown to the choice of his people, he is no lawful king. Now nothing can be more untrue than that the crown of this kingdom is so held by his Majesty. Therefore, if you follow their rule, the king of Great Britain, who most certainly does not owe his high office to any form of popular election, is in no respect better than the rest of the gang of usurpers who reign, or rather rob, all over the face of this our miserable world without any sort of right or title to the allegiance of their people. The policy of this general doctrine, so qualified, is evident enough. The propagators of this political gospel are in hopes that their abstract principle (their principle that a popular choice is necessary to the legal existence of the sovereign magistracy) would be overlooked, whilst the king of Great Britain was not affected by it. In the meantime the ears of their congregations would be gradually habituated to it, as if it were a first principle admitted without dispute. For the present it would only operate as a theory, pickled in the preserving juices of pulpit eloquence, and laid by for future use. Condo et compo no quae mox depromere possim. By this policy, whilst our government is soothed with a reservation in its favor, to which it has no claim, the security which it has in common with all governments, so far as opinion is security, is taken away.
Thus these politicians proceed whilst little notice is taken of their doctrines; but when they come to be examined upon the plain meaning of their words and the direct tendency of their doctrines, then equivocations and slippery constructions come into play. When they say the king owes his crown to the choice of his people and is therefore the only lawful sovereign in the world, they will perhaps tell us they mean to say no more than that some of the king's predecessors have been called to the throne by some sort of choice, and therefore he owes his crown to the choice of his people. Thus, by a miserable subterfuge, they hope to render their proposition safe by rendering it nugatory. They are welcome to the asylum they seek for their offense, since they take refuge in their folly. For if you admit this interpretation, how does their idea of election differ from our idea of inheritance?
And how does the settlement of the crown in the Brunswick line derived from James the First come to legalize our monarchy rather than that of any of the neighbouring countries? At some time or other, to be sure, all the beginners of dynasties were chosen by those who called them to govern. There is ground enough for the opinion that all the kingdoms of Europe were, at a remote period, elective, with more or fewer limitations in the objects of choice. But whatever kings might have been here or elsewhere a thousand years ago, or in whatever manner the ruling dynasties of England or France may have begun, the king of Great Britain is, at this day, king by a fixed rule of succession according to the laws of his country; and whilst the legal conditions of the compact of sovereignty are performed by him (as they are performed), he holds his crown in contempt of the choice of the Revolution Society, who have not a single vote for a king amongst them, either individually or collectively, though I make no doubt they would soon erect themselves into an electoral college if things were ripe to give effect to their claim. His Majesty's heirs and successors, each in his time and order, will come to the crown with the same contempt of their choice with which his Majesty has succeeded to that he wears.
Whatever may be the success of evasion in explaining away the gross error of fact, which supposes that his Majesty (though he holds it in concurrence with the wishes) owes his crown to the choice of his people, yet nothing can evade their full explicit declaration concerning the principle of a right in the people to choose; which right is directly maintained and tenaciously adhered to. All the oblique insinuations concerning election bottom in this proposition and are referable to it. Lest the foundation of the king's exclusive legal title should pass for a mere rant of adulatory freedom, the political divine proceeds dogmatically to assert that, by the principles of the Revolution, the people of England have acquired three fundamental rights, all which, with him, compose one system and lie together in one short sentence, namely, that we have acquired a right:
•	(1) to choose our own governors.
•	(2) to cashier them for misconduct.
•	(3) to frame a government for ourselves.
This new and hitherto unheard-of bill of rights, though made in the name of the whole people, belongs to those gentlemen and their faction only. The body of the people of England have no share in it. They utterly disclaim it. They will resist the practical assertion of it with their lives and fortunes. They are bound to do so by the laws of their country made at the time of that very Revolution which is appealed to in favor of the fictitious rights claimed by the Society which abuses its name.
THESE GENTLEMEN OF THE OLD JEWRY, in all their reasoning’s on the Revolution of 1688, have a revolution which happened in England about forty years before and the late French revolution, so much before their eyes and in their hearts that they are constantly confounding all the three together. It is necessary that we should separate what they confound. We must recall their erring fancies to the acts of the Revolution which we revere, for the discovery of its true principles. If the principles of the Revolution of 1688 are anywhere to be found, it is in the statute called the Declaration of Right. In that most wise, sober, and considerate declaration, drawn up by great lawyers and great statesmen, and not by warm and inexperienced enthusiasts, not one word is said, nor one suggestion made, of a general right ""to choose our own governors, to cashier them for misconduct, and to form a government for ourselves"".
This Declaration of Right (the act of the 1st of William and Mary, sess. 2, ch. 2) is the cornerstone of our constitution as reinforced, explained, improved, and in its fundamental principles for ever settled. It is called, ""An Act for declaring the rights and liberties of the subject, and for settling the succession of the crown"". You will observe that these rights and this succession are declared in one body and bound indissolubly together.
A few years after this period, a second opportunity offered for asserting a right of election to the crown. On the prospect of a total failure of issue from King William, and from the Princess, afterwards Queen Anne, the consideration of the settlement of the crown and of a further security for the liberties of the people again came before the legislature. Did they this second time make any provision for legalizing the crown on the spurious revolution principles of the Old Jewry? No. They followed the principles which prevailed in the Declaration of Right, indicating with more precision the persons who were to inherit in the Protestant line. This act also incorporated, by the same policy, our liberties and an hereditary succession in the same act. Instead of a right to choose our own governors, they declared that the succession in that line (the Protestant line drawn from James the First), was absolutely necessary ""for the peace, quiet, and security of the realm"", and that it was equally urgent on them ""to maintain a certainty in the succession thereof, to which the subjects may safely have recourse for their protection"". Both these acts, in which are heard the unerring, unambiguous oracles of revolution policy, instead of countenancing the delusive, gipsy predictions of a ""right to choose our governors"", prove to a demonstration how totally adverse the wisdom of the nation was from turning a case of necessity into a rule of law.
Unquestionably, there was at the Revolution, in the person of King William, a small and a temporary deviation from the strict order of a regular hereditary succession; but it is against all genuine principles of jurisprudence to draw a principle from a law made in a special case and regarding an individual person. Privilegium non transit in exemplum. If ever there was a time favourable for establishing the principle that a king of popular choice was the only legal king, without all doubt it was at the Revolution. Its not being done at that time is a proof that the nation was of opinion it ought not to be done at any time. There is no person so completely ignorant of our history as not to know that the majority in parliament of both parties were so little disposed to anything resembling that principle that at first they were determined to place the vacant crown, not on the head of the Prince of Orange, but on that of his wife Mary, daughter of King James, the eldest born of the issue of that king, which they acknowledged as undoubtedly his. It would be to repeat a very trite story, to recall to your memory all those circumstances which demonstrated that their accepting King William was not properly a choice; but to all those who did not wish, in effect, to recall King James or to deluge their country in blood and again to bring their religion, laws, and liberties into the peril they had just escaped, it was an act of necessity, in the strictest moral sense in which necessity can be taken.
In the very act in which for a time, and in a single case, parliament departed from the strict order of inheritance in favour of a prince who, though not next, was, however, very near in the line of succession, it is curious to observe how Lord Somers, who drew the bill called the Declaration of Right, has comported himself on that delicate occasion. It is curious to observe with what address this temporary solution of continuity is kept from the eye, whilst all that could be found in this act of necessity to countenance the idea of an hereditary succession is brought forward, and fostered, and made the most of, by this great man and by the legislature who followed him. Quitting the dry, imperative style of an act of parliament, he makes the Lords and Commons fall to a pious, legislative ejaculation and declare that they consider it ""as a marvellous providence and merciful goodness of God to this nation to preserve their said Majesties' royal persons most happily to reign over us on the throne of their ancestors, for which, from the bottom of their hearts, they return their humblest thanks and praises"". The legislature plainly had in view the act of recognition of the first of Queen Elizabeth, chap. 3rd, and of that of James the First, chap. 1st, both acts strongly declaratory of the inheritable nature of the crown; and in many parts they follow, with a nearly literal precision, the words and even the form of thanksgiving which is found in these old declaratory statutes.
The two Houses, in the act of King William, did not thank God that they had found a fair opportunity to assert a right to choose their own governors, much less to make an election the only lawful title to the crown. Their having been in a condition to avoid the very appearance of it, as much as possible, was by them considered as a providential escape. They threw a politic, well-wrought veil over every circumstance tending to weaken the rights which in the meliorated order of succession they meant to perpetuate, or which might furnish a precedent for any future departure from what they had then settled forever. Accordingly, that they might not relax the nerves of their monarchy, and that they might preserve a close conformity to the practice of their ancestors, as it appeared in the declaratory statutes of Queen Mary and Queen Elizabeth, in the next clause they vest, by recognition, in their Majesties all the legal prerogatives of the crown, declaring ""that in them they are most fully, rightfully, and entirely invested, incorporated, united, and annexed"". In the clause which follows, for preventing questions by reason of any pretended titles to the crown, they declare (observing also in this the traditionary language, along with the traditionary policy of the nation, and repeating as from a rubric the language of the preceding acts of Elizabeth and James,) that on the preserving ""a certainty in the SUCCESSION thereof, the unity, peace, and tranquillity of this nation doth, under God, wholly depend"".
They knew that a doubtful title of succession would but too much resemble an election, and that an election would be utterly destructive of the ""unity, peace, and tranquillity of this nation"", which they thought to be considerations of some moment. To provide for these objects and, therefore, to exclude forever the Old Jewry doctrine of ""a right to choose our own governors"", they follow with a clause containing a most solemn pledge, taken from the preceding act of Queen Elizabeth, as solemn a pledge as ever was or can be given in favour of an hereditary succession, and as solemn a renunciation as could be made of the principles by this Society imputed to them: The Lords spiritual and temporal, and Commons, do, in the name of all the people aforesaid, most humbly and faithfully submit themselves, their heirs and posterities for ever; and do faithfully promise that they will stand to maintain, and defend their said Majesties, and also the limitation of the crown, herein specified and contained, to the utmost of their powers, etc. etc.
So far is it from being true that we acquired a right by the Revolution to elect our kings that, if we had possessed it before, the English nation did at that time most solemnly renounce and abdicate it, for themselves and for all their posterity forever.
These gentlemen may value themselves as much as they please on their whig principles, but I never desire to be thought a better whig than Lord Somers, or to understand the principles of the Revolution better than those, by whom it was brought about, or to read in the Declaration of Right any mysteries unknown to those whose penetrating style has engraved in our ordinances, and in our hearts, the words and spirit of that immortal law.
It is true that, aided with the powers derived from force and opportunity, the nation was at that time, in some sense, free to take what course it pleased for filling the throne, but only free to do so upon the same grounds on which they might have wholly abolished their monarchy and every other part of their constitution. However, they did not think such bold changes within their commission. It is indeed difficult, perhaps impossible, to give limits to the mere abstract competence of the supreme power, such as was exercised by parliament at that time, but the limits of a moral competence subjecting, even in powers more indisputably sovereign, occasional will to permanent reason and to the steady maxims of faith, justice, and fixed fundamental policy, are perfectly intelligible and perfectly binding upon those who exercise any authority, under any name or under any title, in the state. The House of Lords, for instance, is not morally competent to dissolve the House of Commons, no, nor even to dissolve itself, nor to abdicate, if it would, its portion in the legislature of the kingdom. Though a king may abdicate for his own person, he cannot abdicate for the monarchy. By as strong, or by a stronger reason, the House of Commons cannot renounce its share of authority. The engagement and pact of society, which generally goes by the name of the constitution, forbids such invasion and such surrender. The constituent parts of a state are obliged to hold their public faith with each other and with all those who derive any serious interest under their engagements, as much as the whole state is bound to keep its faith with separate communities. Otherwise competence and power would soon be confounded and no law be left but the will of a prevailing force. On this principle the succession of the crown has always been what it now is, an hereditary succession by law; in the old line it was a succession by the common law; in the new, by the statute law operating on the principles of the common law, not changing the substance, but regulating the mode and describing the persons. Both these descriptions of law are of the same force and are derived from an equal authority emanating from the common agreement and original compact of the state, communi sponsione reipublicae, and as such are equally binding on king and people, too, as long as the terms are observed and they continue the same body politic.
It is far from impossible to reconcile, if we do not suffer ourselves to be entangled in the mazes of metaphysic sophistry, the use both of a fixed rule and an occasional deviation: the sacredness of an hereditary principle of succession in our government with a power of change in its application in cases of extreme emergency. Even in that extremity (if we take the measure of our rights by our exercise of them at the Revolution), the change is to be confined to the peccant part only, to the part which produced the necessary deviation; and even then it is to be effected without a decomposition of the whole civil and political mass for the purpose of originating a new civil order out of the first elements of society.
A state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation. Without such means it might even risk the loss of that part of the constitution which it wished the most religiously to preserve. The two principles of conservation and correction operated strongly at the two critical periods of the Restoration and Revolution, when England found itself without a king. At both those periods the nation had lost the bond of union in their ancient edifice; they did not, however, dissolve the whole fabric. On the contrary, in both cases they regenerated the deficient part of the old constitution through the parts which were not impaired. They kept these old parts exactly as they were, that the part recovered might be suited to them. They acted by the ancient organized states in the shape of their old organization, and not by the organic moleculae of a disbanded people. At no time, perhaps, did the sovereign legislature manifest a more tender regard to that fundamental principle of British constitutional policy than at the time of the Revolution, when it deviated from the direct line of hereditary succession. The crown was carried somewhat out of the line in which it had before moved, but the new line was derived from the same stock. It was still a line of hereditary descent, still an hereditary descent in the same blood, though an hereditary descent qualified with Protestantism. When the legislature altered the direction, but kept the principle, they showed that they held it inviolable.
On this principle, the law of inheritance had admitted some amendment in the old time, and long before the era of the Revolution. Sometime after the Conquest, great questions arose upon the legal principles of hereditary descent. It became a matter of doubt whether the heir per capita or the heir per stirpes was to succeed; but whether the heir per capita gave way when the heirdom per stirpes took place, or the Catholic heir when the Protestant was preferred, the inheritable principle survived with a sort of immortality through all transmigrations multosque per annos stat fortuna domus, et avi numerantur avorum. This is the spirit of our constitution, not only in its settled course, but in all its revolutions. Whoever came in, or however he came in, whether he obtained the crown by law or by force, the hereditary succession was either continued or adopted.
The gentlemen of the Society for Revolution see nothing in that of 1688 but the deviation from the constitution; and they take the deviation from the principle for the principle. They have little regard to the obvious consequences of their doctrine, though they must see that it leaves positive authority in very few of the positive institutions of this country. When such an unwarrantable maxim is once established, that no throne is lawful but the elective, no one act of the princes who preceded this era of fictitious election can be valid. Do these theorists mean to imitate some of their predecessors who dragged the bodies of our ancient sovereigns out of the quiet of their tombs? Do they mean to attain and disable backward all the kings that have reigned before the Revolution, and consequently to stain the throne of England with the blot of a continual usurpation? Do they mean to invalidate, annul, or to call into question, together with the titles of the whole line of our kings, that great body of our statute law which passed under those whom they treat as usurpers, to annul laws of inestimable value to our liberties? Of as great value at least as any which have passed at or since the period of the Revolution? If kings who did not owe their crown to the choice of their people had no title to make laws, what will become of the statute de tallagio non concedendo? Of the petition of right?  Of the act of habeas corpus? Do these new doctors of the rights of men presume to assert that King James the Second, who came to the crown as next of blood, according to the rules of a then unqualified succession, was not to all intents and purposes a lawful king of England before he had done any of those acts which were justly construed into an abdication of his crown? If he was not, much trouble in parliament might have been saved at the period these gentlemen commemorate. But King James was a bad king with a good title, and not an usurper. The princes who succeeded, according to the act of parliament which settled the crown on the Electress Sophia and on her descendants, being Protestants, came in as much by a title of inheritance as King James did. He came in according to the law as it stood at his accession to the crown; and the princes of the House of Brunswick came to the inheritance of the crown, not by election, but by the law as it stood at their several accessions of Protestant descent and inheritance, as I hope I have shown sufficiently.
The law by which this royal family is specifically destined to the succession is the act of the 12th and 13th of King William. The terms of this act bind ""us and our heirs, and our posterity, to them, their heirs, and their posterity"", being Protestants, to the end of time, in the same words as the Declaration of Right had bound us to the heirs of King William and Queen Mary. It therefore secures both an hereditary crown and an hereditary allegiance. On what ground, except the constitutional policy of forming an establishment to secure that kind of succession which is to preclude a choice of the people forever, could the legislature have fastidiously rejected the fair and abundant choice which our country presented to them and searched in strange lands for a foreign princess from whose womb the line of our future rulers were to derive their title to govern millions of men through a series of ages?
The Princess Sophia was named in the act of settlement of the 12th and 13th of King William for a stock and root of inheritance to our kings, and not for her merits as a temporary administratrix of a power which she might not, and in fact did not, herself ever exercise. She was adopted for one reason, and for one only, because, says the act, ""the most excellent Princess Sophia, Electress and Duchess Dowager of Hanover, is daughter of the most excellent Princess Elizabeth, late Queen of Bohemia, daughter of our late sovereign lord King James the First, of happy memory, and is hereby declared to be the next in succession in the Protestant line etc., etc., and the crown shall continue to the heirs of her body, being Protestants."" This limitation was made by parliament, that through the Princess Sophia an inheritable line not only was to be continued in future, but (what they thought very material) that through her it was to be connected with the old stock of inheritance in King James the First, in order that the monarchy might preserve an unbroken unity through all ages and might be preserved (with safety to our religion) in the old approved mode by descent, in which, if our liberties had been once endangered, they had often, through all storms and struggles of prerogative and privilege, been preserved. They did well. No experience has taught us that in any other course or method than that of an hereditary crown our liberties can be regularly perpetuated and preserved sacred as our hereditary right.
An irregular, convulsive movement may be necessary to throw off an irregular, convulsive disease. But the course of succession is the healthy habit of the British constitution. Was it that the legislature wanted, at the act for the limitation of the crown in the Hanoverian line, drawn through the female descendants of James the First, a due sense of the inconveniences of having two or three, or possibly more, foreigners in succession to the British throne? No! — they had a due sense of the evils which might happen from such foreign rule, and more than a due sense of them. But a more decisive proof cannot be given of the full conviction of the British nation that the principles of the Revolution did not authorize them to elect kings at their pleasure, and without any attention to the ancient fundamental principles of our government, than their continuing to adopt a plan of hereditary Protestant succession in the old line, with all the dangers and all the inconveniences of its being a foreign line full before their eyes and operating with the utmost force upon their minds.
A few years ago I should be ashamed to overload a matter so capable of supporting itself by the then unnecessary support of any argument; but this seditious, unconstitutional doctrine is now publicly taught, avowed, and printed. The dislike I feel to revolutions, the signals for which have so often been given from pulpits; the spirit of change that is gone abroad; the total contempt which prevails with you, and may come to prevail with us, of all ancient institutions when set in opposition to a present sense of convenience or to the bent of a present inclination: all these considerations make it not unadvisable, in my opinion, to call back our attention to the true principles of our own domestic laws; that you, my French friend, should begin to know, and that we should continue to cherish them. We ought not, on either side of the water, to suffer ourselves to be imposed upon by the counterfeit wares which some persons, by a double fraud, export to you in illicit bottoms as raw commodities of British growth, though wholly alien to our soil, in order afterwards to smuggle them back again into this country, manufactured after the newest Paris fashion of an improved liberty.
The people of England will not ape the fashions they have never tried, nor go back to those which they have found mischievous on trial. They look upon the legal hereditary succession of their crown as among their rights, not as among their wrongs; as a benefit, not as a grievance; as a security for their liberty, not as a badge of servitude. They look on the frame of their commonwealth, such as it stands, to be of inestimable value, and they conceive the undisturbed succession of the crown to be a pledge of the stability and perpetuity of all the other members of our constitution.
I shall beg leave, before I go any further, to take notice of some paltry artifices which the abettors of election, as the only lawful title to the crown, are ready to employ in order to render the support of the just principles of our constitution a task somewhat invidious. These sophisters substitute a fictitious cause and feigned personages, in whose favor they suppose you engaged whenever you defend the inheritable nature of the crown. It is common with them to dispute as if they were in a conflict with some of those exploded fanatics of slavery, who formerly maintained what I believe no creature now maintains, ""that the crown is held by divine hereditary and indefeasible right"". — These old fanatics of single arbitrary power dogmatized as if hereditary royalty was the only lawful government in the world, just as our new fanatics of popular arbitrary power maintain that a popular election is the sole lawful source of authority. The old prerogative enthusiasts, it is true, did speculate foolishly, and perhaps impiously too, as if monarchy had more of a divine sanction than any other mode of government; and as if a right to govern by inheritance were in strictness indefeasible in every person who should be found in the succession to a throne, and under every circumstance, which no civil or political right can be. But an absurd opinion concerning the king's hereditary right to the crown does not prejudice one that is rational and bottomed upon solid principles of law and policy. If all the absurd theories of lawyers and divines were to vitiate the objects in which they are conversant, we should have no law and no religion left in the world. But an absurd theory on one side of a question forms no justification for alleging a false fact or promulgating mischievous maxims on the other.
THE second claim of the Revolution Society is ""a right of cashiering their governors for misconduct"". Perhaps the apprehensions our ancestors entertained of forming such a precedent as that ""of cashiering for misconduct"" was the cause that the declaration of the act, which implied the abdication of King James, was, if it had any fault, rather too guarded and too circumstantial. But all this guard and all this accumulation of circumstances serves to show the spirit of caution which predominated in the national councils in a situation in which men irritated by oppression, and elevated by a triumph over it, are apt to abandon themselves to violent and extreme courses; it shows the anxiety of the great men who influenced the conduct of affairs at that great event to make the Revolution a parent of settlement, and not a nursery of future revolutions.
No government could stand a moment if it could be blown down with anything so loose and indefinite as an opinion of ""misconduct"". They who led at the Revolution grounded the virtual abdication of King James upon no such light and uncertain principle. They charged him with nothing less than a design, confirmed by a multitude of illegal overt acts, to subvert the Protestant church and state, and their fundamental, unquestionable laws and liberties; they charged him with having broken the original contract between king and people. This was more than misconduct. A grave and overruling necessity obliged them to take the step they took, and took with infinite reluctance, as under that most rigorous of all laws. Their trust for the future preservation of the constitution was not in future revolutions. The grand policy of all their regulations was to render it almost impracticable for any future sovereign to compel the states of the kingdom to have again recourse to those violent remedies. They left the crown what, in the eye and estimation of law, it had ever been-perfectly irresponsible. In order to lighten the crown still further, they aggravated responsibility on ministers of state. By the statute of the 1st of King William, sess. 2nd, called ""the act for declaring the rights and liberties of the subject, and for settling the succession of the crown"", they enacted that the ministers should serve the crown on the terms of that declaration. They secured soon after the frequent meetings of parliament, by which the whole government would be under the constant inspection and active control of the popular representative and of the magnates of the kingdom. In the next great constitutional act, that of the 12th and 13th of King William, for the further limitation of the crown and better securing the rights and liberties of the subject, they provided ""that no pardon under the great seal of England should be pleadable to an impeachment by the Commons in parliament"". The rule laid down for government in the Declaration of Right, the constant inspection of parliament, the practical claim of impeachment, they thought infinitely a better security, not only for their constitutional liberty, but against the vices of administration, than the reservation of a right so difficult in the practice, so uncertain in the issue, and often so mischievous in the consequences, as that of ""cashiering their governors"".
Dr. Price, in this sermon,condemns very properly the practice of gross, adulatory addresses to kings. Instead of this fulsome style, he proposes that his Majesty should be told, on occasions of congratulation that ""he is to consider himself as more properly the servant than the sovereign of his people"". For a compliment, this new form of address does not seem to be very soothing. Those who are servants in name, as well as in effect, do not like to be told of their situation, their duty, and their obligations. The slave, in the old play, tells his master, ""Haec commemoratio est quasi exprobatio"". It is not pleasant as compliment; it is not wholesome as instruction. After all, if the king were to bring himself to echo this new kind of address, to adopt it in terms, and even to take the appellation of Servant of the People as his royal style, how either he or we should be much mended by it I cannot imagine. I have seen very assuming letters, signed ""Your most obedient, humble servant"". The proudest denomination that ever was endured on earth took a title of still greater humility than that which is now proposed for sovereigns by the Apostle of Liberty. Kings and nations were trampled upon by the foot of one calling himself ""the Servant of Servants""; and mandates for deposing sovereigns were sealed with the signet of ""the Fisherman"".
I should have considered all this as no more than a sort of flippant, vain discourse, in which, as in an unsavory fume, several persons suffer the spirit of liberty to evaporate, if it were not plainly in support of the idea and a part of the scheme of ""cashiering kings for misconduct"". In that light it is worth some observation.
Kings, in one sense, are undoubtedly the servants of the people because their power has no other rational end than that of the general advantage; but it is not true that they are, in the ordinary sense (by our constitution, at least), anything like servants; the essence of whose situation is to obey the commands of some other and to be removable at pleasure. But the king of Great Britain obeys no other person; all other persons are individually, and collectively too, under him and owe to him a legal obedience. The law, which knows neither to flatter nor to insult, calls this high magistrate not our servant, as this humble divine calls him, but ""our sovereign Lord the king""; and we, on our parts, have learned to speak only the primitive language of the law, and not the confused jargon of their Babylonian pulpits.
As he is not to obey us, but as we are to obey the law in him, our constitution has made no sort of provision toward rendering him, as a servant, in any degree responsible. Our constitution knows nothing of a magistrate like the Justicia of Aragon, nor of any court legally appointed, nor of any process legally settled, for submitting the king to the responsibility belonging to all servants. In this he is not distinguished from the Commons and the Lords, who, in their several public capacities, can never be called to an account for their conduct, although the Revolution Society chooses to assert, in direct opposition to one of the wisest and most beautiful parts of our constitution, that ""a king is no more than the first servant of the public, created by it, and responsible to it""
Ill would our ancestors at the Revolution have deserved their fame for wisdom if they had found no security for their freedom but in rendering their government feeble in its operations, and precarious in its tenure; if they had been able to contrive no better remedy against arbitrary power than civil confusion. Let these gentlemen state who that representative public is to whom they will affirm the king, as a servant, to be responsible. It will then be time enough for me to produce to them the positive statute law which affirms that he is not.
The ceremony of cashiering kings, of which these gentlemen talk so much at their ease, can rarely, if ever, be performed without force. It then becomes a case of war, and not of constitution. Laws are commanded to hold their tongues amongst arms, and tribunals fall to the ground with the peace they are no longer able to uphold. The Revolution of 1688 was obtained by a just war, in the only case in which any war, and much more a civil war, can be just. Justa bella quibus necessaria. The question of dethroning or, if these gentlemen like the phrase better, ""cashiering kings"" will always be, as it has always been, an extraordinary question of state, and wholly out of the law — a question (like all other questions of state) of dispositions and of means and of probable consequences rather than of positive rights. As it was not made for common abuses, so it is not to be agitated by common minds. The speculative line of demarcation where obedience ought to end and resistance must begin is faint, obscure, and not easily definable. It is not a single act, or a single event, which determines it. Governments must be abused and deranged, indeed, before it can be thought of; and the prospect of the future must be as bad as the experience of the past. When things are in that lamentable condition, the nature of the disease is to indicate the remedy to those whom nature has qualified to administer in extremities this critical, ambiguous, bitter potion to a distempered state. Times and occasions and provocations will teach their own lessons. The wise will determine from the gravity of the case; the irritable, from sensibility to oppression; the high minded, from disdain and indignation at abusive power in unworthy hands; the brave and bold, from the love of honorable danger in a generous cause; but, with or without right, a revolution will be the very last resource of the thinking and the good.
THE third head of right, asserted by the pulpit of the Old Jewry, namely, the ""right to form a government for ourselves"", has, at least, as little countenance from anything done at the Revolution, either in precedent or principle, as the two first of their claims. The Revolution was made to preserve our ancient, indisputable laws and liberties and that ancient constitution of government which is our only security for law and liberty. If you are desirous of knowing the spirit of our constitution and the policy which predominated in that great period which has secured it to this hour, pray look for both in our histories, in our records, in our acts of parliament, and journals of parliament, and not in the sermons of the Old Jewry and the after-dinner toasts of the Revolution Society. In the former you will find other ideas and another language. Such a claim is as ill-suited to our temper and wishes as it is unsupported by any appearance of authority. The very idea of the fabrication of a new government is enough to fill us with disgust and horror. We wished at the period of the Revolution, and do now wish, to derive all we possess as an inheritance from our forefathers. Upon that body and stock of inheritance we have taken care not to inoculate any cyon alien to the nature of the original plant. All the reformations we have hitherto made have proceeded upon the principle of reverence to antiquity; and I hope, nay, I am persuaded, that all those which possibly may be made hereafter will be carefully formed upon analogical precedent, authority, and example.
Our oldest reformation is that of Magna Charta. You will see that Sir Edward Coke, that great oracle of our law, and indeed all the great men who follow him, to Blackstone are industrious to prove the pedigree of our liberties. They endeavor to prove that the ancient charter, the Magna Charta of King John, was connected with another positive charter from Henry I, and that both the one and the other were nothing more than a reaffirmance of the still more ancient standing law of the kingdom. In the matter of fact, for the greater part these authors appear to be in the right; perhaps not always; but if the lawyers mistake in some particulars, it proves my position still the more strongly, because it demonstrates the powerful prepossession toward antiquity, with which the minds of all our lawyers and legislators, and of all the people whom they wish to influence, have been always filled, and the stationary policy of this kingdom in considering their most sacred rights and franchises as an inheritance.
In the famous law of the 3rd of Charles I, called the Petition of Right, the parliament says to the king, ""Your subjects have inherited this freedom"", claiming their franchises not on abstract principles ""as the rights of men"", but as the rights of Englishmen, and as a patrimony derived from their forefathers. Selden and the other profoundly learned men who drew this Petition of Right were as well acquainted, at least, with all the general theories concerning the ""rights of men"" as any of the discoursers in our pulpits or on your tribune; full as well as Dr. Price or as the Abbe Sieyes. But, for reasons worthy of that practical wisdom which superseded their theoretic science, they preferred this positive, recorded, hereditary title to all which can be dear to the man and the citizen, to that vague speculative right which exposed their sure inheritance to be scrambled for and torn to pieces by every wild, litigious spirit.
The same policy pervades all the laws which have since been made for the preservation of our liberties. In the 1st of William and Mary, in the famous statute called the Declaration of Right, the two Houses utter not a syllable of ""a right to frame a government for themselves"". You will see that their whole care was to secure the religion, laws, and liberties that had been long possessed, and had been lately endangered. ""Taking into their most serious consideration the best means for making such an establishment, that their religion, laws, and liberties might not be in danger of being again subverted"", they auspicate all their proceedings by stating as some of those best means, ""in the first place"" to do ""as their ancestors in like cases have usually done for vindicating their ancient rights and liberties, to declare"" — and then they pray the king and queen ""that it may be declared and enacted that all and singular the rights and liberties asserted and declared are the true ancient and indubitable rights and liberties of the people of this kingdom"".
You will observe that from Magna Charta to the Declaration of Right it has been the uniform policy of our constitution to claim and assert our liberties as an entailed inheritance derived to us from our forefathers, and to be transmitted to our posterity — as an estate specially belonging to the people of this kingdom, without any reference whatever to any other more general or prior right. By this means our constitution preserves a unity in so great a diversity of its parts. We have an inheritable crown, an inheritable peerage, and a House of Commons and a people inheriting privileges, franchises, and liberties from a long line of ancestors.
This policy appears to me to be the result of profound reflection, or rather the happy effect of following nature, which is wisdom without reflection, and above it. A spirit of innovation is generally the result of a selfish temper and confined views. People will not look forward to posterity, who never look backward to their ancestors. Besides, the people of England well know that the idea of inheritance furnishes a sure principle of conservation and a sure principle of transmission, without at all excluding a principle of improvement. It leaves acquisition free, but it secures what it acquires. Whatever advantages are obtained by a state proceeding on these maxims are locked fast as in a sort of family settlement, grasped as in a kind of mortmain forever. By a constitutional policy, working after the pattern of nature, we receive, we hold, we transmit our government and our privileges in the same manner in which we enjoy and transmit our property and our lives. The institutions of policy, the goods of fortune, the gifts of providence are handed down to us, and from us, in the same course and order. Our political system is placed in a just correspondence and symmetry with the order of the world and with the mode of existence decreed to a permanent body composed of transitory parts, wherein, by the disposition of a stupendous wisdom, molding together the great mysterious incorporation of the human race, the whole, at one time, is never old or middle-aged or young, but, in a condition of unchangeable constancy, moves on through the varied tenor of perpetual decay, fall, renovation, and progression. Thus, by preserving the method of nature in the conduct of the state, in what we improve we are never wholly new; in what we retain we are never wholly obsolete. By adhering in this manner and on those principles to our forefathers, we are guided not by the superstition of antiquarians, but by the spirit of philosophic analogy. In this choice of inheritance we have given to our frame of polity the image of a relation in blood, binding up the constitution of our country with our dearest domestic ties, adopting our fundamental laws into the bosom of our family affections, keeping inseparable and cherishing with the warmth of all their combined and mutually reflected charities our state, our hearths, our sepulchres, and our altars.
Through the same plan of a conformity to nature in our artificial institutions, and by calling in the aid of her unerring and powerful instincts to fortify the fallible and feeble contrivances of our reason, we have derived several other, and those no small, benefits from considering our liberties in the light of an inheritance. Always acting as if in the presence of canonized forefathers, the spirit of freedom, leading in itself to misrule and excess, is tempered with an awful gravity. This idea of a liberal descent inspires us with a sense of habitual native dignity which prevents that upstart insolence almost inevitably adhering to and disgracing those who are the first acquirers of any distinction. By this means our liberty becomes a noble freedom.
It carries an imposing and majestic aspect. It has a pedigree and illustrating ancestors. It has its bearings and its ensigns armorial. It has its gallery of portraits, its monumental inscriptions, its records, evidences, and titles. We procure reverence to our civil institutions on the principle upon which nature teaches us to revere individual men: on account of their age and on account of those from whom they are descended. All your sophisters cannot produce anything better adapted to preserve a rational and manly freedom than the course that we have pursued, who have chosen our nature rather than our speculations, our breasts rather than our inventions, for the great conservatories and magazines of our rights and privileges.
YOU MIGHT, IF YOU PLEASED, have profited of our example and have given to your recovered freedom a correspondent dignity. Your privileges, though discontinued, were not lost to memory. Your constitution, it is true, whilst you were out of possession, suffered waste and dilapidation; but you possessed in some parts the walls and in all the foundations of a noble and venerable castle. You might have repaired those walls; you might have built on those old foundations. Your constitution was suspended before it was perfected, but you had the elements of a constitution very nearly as good as could be wished. In your old states you possessed that variety of parts corresponding with the various descriptions of which your community was happily composed; you had all that combination and all that opposition of interests; you had that action and counteraction which, in the natural and in the political world, from the reciprocal struggle of discordant powers, draws out the harmony of the universe. These opposed and conflicting interests which you considered as so great a blemish in your old and in our present constitution interpose a salutary check to all precipitate resolutions. They render deliberation a matter, not of choice, but of necessity; they make all change a subject of compromise, which naturally begets moderation; they produce temperaments preventing the sore evil of harsh, crude, unqualified reformations, and rendering all the headlong exertions of arbitrary power, in the few or in the many, for ever impracticable. Through that diversity of members and interests, general liberty had as many securities as there were separate views in the several orders, whilst, by pressing down the whole by the weight of a real monarchy, the separate parts would have been prevented from warping and starting from their allotted places.
You had all these advantages in your ancient states, but you chose to act as if you had never been molded into civil society and had everything to begin anew. You began ill, because you began by despising everything that belonged to you. You set up your trade without a capital. If the last generations of your country appeared without much luster in your eyes, you might have passed them by and derived your claims from a more early race of ancestors. Under a pious predilection for those ancestors, your imaginations would have realized in them a standard of virtue and wisdom beyond the vulgar practice of the hour; and you would have risen with the example to whose imitation you aspired. Respecting your forefathers, you would have been taught to respect yourselves. You would not have chosen to consider the French as a people of yesterday, as a nation of lowborn servile wretches until the emancipating year of 1789. In order to furnish, at the expense of your honor, an excuse to your apologists here for several enormities of yours, you would not have been content to be represented as a gang of Maroon slaves suddenly broke loose from the house of bondage, and therefore to be pardoned for your abuse of the liberty to which you were not accustomed and ill fitted. Would it not, my worthy friend, have been wiser to have you thought, what I, for one, always thought you, a generous and gallant nation, long misled to your disadvantage by your high and romantic sentiments of fidelity, honor, and loyalty; that events had been unfavorable to you, but that you were not enslaved through any illiberal or servile disposition; that in your most devoted submission you were actuated by a principle of public spirit, and that it was your country you worshiped in the person of your king? Had you made it to be understood that in the delusion of this amiable error you had gone further than your wise ancestors, that you were resolved to resume your ancient privileges, whilst you preserved the spirit of your ancient and your recent loyalty and honor; or if, diffident of yourselves and not clearly discerning the almost obliterated constitution of your ancestors, you had looked to your neighbors in this land who had kept alive the ancient principles and models of the old common law of Europe meliorated and adapted to its present state — by following wise examples you would have given new examples of wisdom to the world. You would have rendered the cause of liberty venerable in the eyes of every worthy mind in every nation. You would have shamed despotism from the earth by showing that freedom was not only reconcilable, but, as when well disciplined it is, auxiliary to law. You would have had an unoppressive but a productive revenue. You would have had a flourishing commerce to feed it. You would have had a free constitution, a potent monarchy, a disciplined army, a reformed and venerated clergy, a mitigated but spirited nobility to lead your virtue, not to overlay it; you would have had a liberal order of commons to emulate and to recruit that nobility; you would have had a protected, satisfied, laborious, and obedient people, taught to seek and to recognize the happiness that is to be found by virtue in all conditions; in which consists the true moral equality of mankind, and not in that monstrous fiction which, by inspiring false ideas and vain expectations into men destined to travel in the obscure walk of laborious life, serves only to aggravate and embitter that real inequality which it never can remove, and which the order of civil life establishes as much for the benefit of those whom it must leave in a humble state as those whom it is able to exalt to a condition more splendid, but not more happy. You had a smooth and easy career of felicity and glory laid open to you, beyond anything recorded in the history of the world, but you have shown that difficulty is good for man.
COMPUTE your gains: see what is got by those extravagant and presumptuous speculations which have taught your leaders to despise all their predecessors, and all their contemporaries, and even to despise themselves until the moment in which they become truly despicable. By following those false lights, France has bought undisguised calamities at a higher price than any nation has purchased the most unequivocal blessings! France has bought poverty by crime! France has not sacrificed her virtue to her interest, but she has abandoned her interest, that she might prostitute her virtue. All other nations have begun the fabric of a new government, or the reformation of an old, by establishing originally or by enforcing with greater exactness some rites or other of religion. All other people have laid the foundations of civil freedom in severer manners and a system of a more austere and masculine morality. France, when she let loose the reins of regal authority, doubled the license of a ferocious dissoluteness in manners and of an insolent irreligion in opinions and practice, and has extended through all ranks of life, as if she were communicating some privilege or laying open some secluded benefit, all the unhappy corruptions that usually were the disease of wealth and power. This is one of the new principles of equality in France.
France, by the perfidy of her leaders, has utterly disgraced the tone of lenient council in the cabinets of princes, and disarmed it of its most potent topics. She has sanctified the dark, suspicious maxims of tyrannous distrust, and taught kings to tremble at (what will hereafter be called) the delusive plausibilities of moral politicians. Sovereigns will consider those who advise them to place an unlimited confidence in their people as subverters of their thrones, as traitors who aim at their destruction by leading their easy good-nature, under specious pretenses, to admit combinations of bold and faithless men into a participation of their power. This alone (if there were nothing else) is an irreparable calamity to you and to mankind. Remember that your parliament of Paris told your king that, in calling the states together, he had nothing to fear but the prodigal excess of their zeal in providing for the support of the throne. It is right that these men should hide their heads. It is right that they should bear their part in the ruin which their counsel has brought on their sovereign and their country. Such sanguine declarations tend to lull authority asleep; to encourage it rashly to engage in perilous adventures of untried policy; to neglect those provisions, preparations, and precautions which distinguish benevolence from imbecility, and without which no man can answer for the salutary effect of any abstract plan of government or of freedom. For want of these, they have seen the medicine of the state corrupted into its poison. They have seen the French rebel against a mild and lawful monarch with more fury, outrage, and insult than ever any people has been known to rise against the most illegal usurper or the most sanguinary tyrant. Their resistance was made to concession, their revolt was from protection, their blow was aimed at a hand holding out graces, favors, and immunities.
This was unnatural. The rest is in order. They have found their punishment in their success: laws overturned; tribunals subverted; industry without vigor; commerce expiring; the revenue unpaid, yet the people impoverished; a church pillaged, and a state not relieved; civil and military anarchy made the constitution of the kingdom; everything human and divine sacrificed to the idol of public credit, and national bankruptcy the consequence; and, to crown all, the paper securities of new, precarious, tottering power, the discredited paper securities of impoverished fraud and beggared rapine, held out as a currency for the support of an empire in lieu of the two great recognized species that represent the lasting, conventional credit of mankind, which disappeared and hid themselves in the earth from whence they came, when the principle of property, whose creatures and representatives they are, was systematically subverted.
Were all these dreadful things necessary? Were they the inevitable results of the desperate struggle of determined patriots, compelled to wade through blood and tumult to the quiet shore of a tranquil and prosperous liberty? No! nothing like it. The fresh ruins of France, which shock our feelings wherever we can turn our eyes, are not the devastation of civil war; they are the sad but instructive monuments of rash and ignorant counsel in time of profound peace. They are the display of inconsiderate and presumptuous, because unresisted and irresistible, authority. The persons who have thus squandered away the precious treasure of their crimes, the persons who have made this prodigal and wild waste of public evils (the last stake reserved for the ultimate ransom of the state) have met in their progress with little or rather with no opposition at all. Their whole march was more like a triumphal procession than the progress of a war. Their pioneers have gone before them and demolished and laid everything level at their feet. Not one drop of their blood have they shed in the cause of the country they have ruined. They have made no sacrifices to their projects of greater consequence than their shoebuckles, whilst they were imprisoning their king, murdering their fellow citizens, and bathing in tears and plunging in poverty and distress thousands of worthy men and worthy families. Their cruelty has not even been the base result of fear. It has been the effect of their sense of perfect safety, in authorizing treasons, robberies, rapes, assassinations, slaughters, and burnings throughout their harassed land. But the cause of all was plain from the beginning.
THIS unforced choice, this fond election of evil, would appear perfectly unaccountable if we did not consider the composition of the National Assembly. I do not mean its formal constitution, which, as it now stands, is exceptionable enough, but the materials of which, in a great measure, it is composed, which is of ten thousand times greater consequence than all the formalities in the world. If we were to know nothing of this assembly but by its title and function, no colors could paint to the imagination anything more venerable. In that light the mind of an inquirer, subdued by such an awful image as that of the virtue and wisdom of a whole people collected into a focus, would pause and hesitate in condemning things even of the very worst aspect. Instead of blamable, they would appear only mysterious. But no name, no power, no function, no artificial institution whatsoever can make the men of whom any system of authority is composed any other than God, and nature, and education, and their habits of life have made them. Capacities beyond these the people have not to give. Virtue and wisdom may be the objects of their choice, but their choice confers neither the one nor the other on those upon whom they lay their ordaining hands. They have not the engagement of nature, they have not the promise of revelation, for any such powers.
After I had read over the list of the persons and descriptions elected into the Tiers Etat, nothing which they afterwards did could appear astonishing. Among them, indeed, I saw some of known rank, some of shining talents; but of any practical experience in the state, not one man was to be found. The best were only men of theory. But whatever the distinguished few may have been, it is the substance and mass of the body which constitutes its character and must finally determine its direction. In all bodies, those who will lead must also, in a considerable degree, follow. They must conform their propositions to the taste, talent, and disposition of those whom they wish to conduct; therefore, if an assembly is viciously or feebly composed in a very great part of it, nothing but such a supreme degree of virtue as very rarely appears in the world, and for that reason cannot enter into calculation, will prevent the men of talent disseminated through it from becoming only the expert instruments of absurd projects! If, what is the more likely event, instead of that unusual degree of virtue, they should be actuated by sinister ambition and a lust of meretricious glory, then the feeble part of the assembly, to whom at first they conform, becomes in its turn the dupe and instrument of their designs. In this political traffic, the leaders will be obliged to bow to the ignorance of their followers, and the followers to become subservient to the worst designs of their leaders.
To secure any degree of sobriety in the propositions made by the leaders in any public assembly, they ought to respect, in some degree perhaps to fear, those whom they conduct. To be led any otherwise than blindly, the followers must be qualified, if not for actors, at least for judges; they must also be judges of natural weight and authority. Nothing can secure a steady and moderate conduct in such assemblies but that the body of them should be respectably composed, in point of condition in life or permanent property, of education, and of such habits as enlarge and liberalize the understanding.
In the calling of the States-General of France, the first thing that struck me was a great departure from the ancient course. I found the representation for the Third Estate composed of six hundred persons. They were equal in number to the representatives of both the other orders. If the orders were to act separately, the number would not, beyond the consideration of the expense, be of much moment. But when it became apparent that the three orders were to be melted down into one, the policy and necessary effect of this numerous representation became obvious. A very small desertion from either of the other two orders must throw the power of both into the hands of the third. In fact, the whole power of the state was soon resolved into that body. Its due composition became therefore of infinitely the greater importance.
Judge, Sir, of my surprise when I found that a very great proportion of the assembly (a majority, I believe, of the members who attended) was composed of practitioners in the law. It was composed, not of distinguished magistrates, who had given pledges to their country of their science, prudence, and integrity; not of leading advocates, the glory of the bar; not of renowned professors in universities; — but for the far greater part, as it must in such a number, of the inferior, unlearned, mechanical, merely instrumental members of the profession. There were distinguished exceptions, but the general composition was of obscure provincial advocates, of stewards of petty local jurisdictions, country attornies, notaries, and the whole train of the ministers of municipal litigation, the fomenters and conductors of the petty war of village vexation. From the moment I read the list, I saw distinctly, and very nearly as it has happened, all that was to follow.
The degree of estimation in which any profession is held becomes the standard of the estimation in which the professors hold themselves. Whatever the personal merits of many individual lawyers might have been, and in many it was undoubtedly very considerable, in that military kingdom no part of the profession had been much regarded except the highest of all, who often united to their professional offices great family splendor, and were invested with great power and authority. These certainly were highly respected, and even with no small degree of awe. The next rank was not much esteemed; the mechanical part was in a very low degree of repute.
Whenever the supreme authority is vested in a body so composed, it must evidently produce the consequences of supreme authority placed in the hands of men not taught habitually to respect themselves, who had no previous fortune in character at stake, who could not be expected to bear with moderation, or to conduct with discretion, a power which they themselves, more than any others, must be surprised to find in their hands. Who could flatter himself that these men, suddenly and, as it were, by enchantment snatched from the humblest rank of subordination, would not be intoxicated with their unprepared greatness? Who could conceive that men who are habitually meddling, daring, subtle, active, of litigious dispositions and unquiet minds would easily fall back into their old condition of obscure contention and laborious, low, unprofitable chicane? Who could doubt but that, at any expense to the state, of which they understood nothing, they must pursue their private interests, which they understand but too well? It was not an event depending on chance or contingency. It was inevitable; it was necessary; it was planted in the nature of things. They must join (if their capacity did not permit them to lead) in any project which could procure to them a litigious constitution; which could lay open to them those innumerable lucrative jobs which follow in the train of all great convulsions and revolutions in the state, and particularly in all great and violent permutations of property. Was it to be expected that they would attend to the stability of property, whose existence had always depended upon whatever rendered property questionable, ambiguous, and insecure? Their objects would be enlarged with their elevation, but their disposition and habits, and mode of accomplishing their designs, must remain the same.
Well! but these men were to be tempered and restrained by other descriptions, of more sober and more enlarged understandings. Were they then to be awed by the supereminent authority and awful dignity of a handful of country clowns who have seats in that assembly, some of whom are said not to be able to read and write, and by not a greater number of traders who, though somewhat more instructed and more conspicuous in the order of society, had never known anything beyond their counting house? No! Both these descriptions were more formed to be overborne and swayed by the intrigues and artifices of lawyers than to become their counterpoise. With such a dangerous disproportion, the whole must needs be governed by them. To the faculty of law was joined a pretty considerable proportion of the faculty of medicine. This faculty had not, any more than that of the law, possessed in France its just estimation. Its professors, therefore, must have the qualities of men not habituated to sentiments of dignity. But supposing they had ranked as they ought to do, and as with us they do actually, the sides of sickbeds are not the academies for forming statesmen and legislators. Then came the dealers in stocks and funds, who must be eager, at any expense, to change their ideal paper wealth for the more solid substance of land. To these were joined men of other descriptions, from whom as little knowledge of, or attention to, the interests of a great state was to be expected, and as little regard to the stability of any institution; men formed to be instruments, not controls. Such in general was the composition of the Tiers Etat in the National Assembly, in which was scarcely to be perceived the slightest traces of what we call the natural landed interest of the country.
We know that the British House of Commons, without shutting its doors to any merit in any class, is, by the sure operation of adequate causes, filled with everything illustrious in rank, in descent, in hereditary and in acquired opulence, in cultivated talents, in military, civil, naval, and politic distinction that the country can afford. But supposing, what hardly can be supposed as a case, that the House of Commons should be composed in the same manner with the Tiers Etat in France, would this dominion of chicane be borne with patience or even conceived without horror? God forbid I should insinuate anything derogatory to that profession which is another priesthood, administering the rights of sacred justice. But whilst I revere men in the functions which belong to them, and would do as much as one man can do to prevent their exclusion from any, I cannot, to flatter them, give the lie to nature. They are good and useful in the composition; they must be mischievous if they preponderate so as virtually to become the whole. Their very excellence in their peculiar functions may be far from a qualification for others. It cannot escape observation that when men are too much confined to professional and faculty habits and, as it were, inveterate in the recurrent employment of that narrow circle, they are rather disabled than qualified for whatever depends on the knowledge of mankind, on experience in mixed affairs, on a comprehensive, connected view of the various, complicated, external and internal interests which go to the formation of that multifarious thing called a state.
After all, if the House of Commons were to have a wholly professional and faculty composition, what is the power of the House of Commons, circumscribed and shut in by the immovable barriers of laws, usages, positive rules of doctrine and practice, counterpoised by the House of Lords, and every moment of its existence at the discretion of the crown to continue, prorogue, or dissolve us? The power of the House of Commons, direct or indirect, is indeed great; and long may it be able to preserve its greatness and the spirit belonging to true greatness at the full; and it will do so as long as it can keep the breakers of law in India from becoming the makers of law for England. The power, however, of the House of Commons, when least diminished, is as a drop of water in the ocean, compared to that residing in a settled majority of your National Assembly. That assembly, since the destruction of the orders, has no fundamental law, no strict convention, no respected usage to restrain it. Instead of finding themselves obliged to conform to a fixed constitution, they have a power to make a constitution which shall conform to their designs. Nothing in heaven or upon earth can serve as a control on them. What ought to be the heads, the hearts, the dispositions that are qualified or that dare, not only to make laws under a fixed constitution, but at one heat to strike out a totally new constitution for a great kingdom, and in every part of it, from the monarch on the throne to the vestry of a parish? But — ""fools rush in where angels fear to tread"". In such a state of unbounded power for undefined and undefinable purposes, the evil of a moral and almost physical inaptitude of the man to the function must be the greatest we can conceive to happen in the management of human affairs.
Having considered the composition of the Third Estate as it stood in its original frame, I took a view of the representatives of the clergy. There, too, it appeared that full as little regard was had to the general security of property or to the aptitude of the deputies for the public purposes, in the principles of their election. That election was so contrived as to send a very large proportion of mere country curates to the great and arduous work of new-modeling a state: men who never had seen the state so much as in a picture — men who knew nothing of the world beyond the bounds of an obscure village; who, immersed in hopeless poverty, could regard all property, whether secular or ecclesiastical, with no other eye than that of envy; among whom must be many who, for the smallest hope of the meanest dividend in plunder, would readily join in any attempts upon a body of wealth in which they could hardly look to have any share except in a general scramble. Instead of balancing the power of the active chicaners in the other assembly, these curates must necessarily become the active coadjutors, or at best the passive instruments, of those by whom they had been habitually guided in their petty village concerns. They, too, could hardly be the most conscientious of their kind who, presuming upon their incompetent understanding, could intrigue for a trust which led them from their natural relation to their flocks and their natural spheres of action to undertake the regeneration of kingdoms. This preponderating weight, being added to the force of the body of chicane in the Tiers Etat, completed that momentum of ignorance, rashness, presumption, and lust of plunder, which nothing has been able to resist.
To observing men it must have appeared from the beginning that the majority of the Third Estate, in conjunction with such a deputation from the clergy as I have described, whilst it pursued the destruction of the nobility, would inevitably become subservient to the worst designs of individuals in that class. In the spoil and humiliation of their own order these individuals would possess a sure fund for the pay of their new followers. To squander away the objects which made the happiness of their fellows would be to them no sacrifice at all. Turbulent, discontented men of quality, in proportion as they are puffed up with personal pride and arrogance, generally despise their own order. One of the first symptoms they discover of a selfish and mischievous ambition is a profligate disregard of a dignity which they partake with others. To be attached to the subdivision, to love the little platoon we belong to in society, is the first principle (the germ as it were) of public affections. It is the first link in the series by which we proceed toward a love to our country and to mankind. The interest of that portion of social arrangement is a trust in the hands of all those who compose it; and as none but bad men would justify it in abuse, none but traitors would barter it away for their own personal advantage.
There were in the time of our civil troubles in England (I do not know whether you have any such in your assembly in France) several persons, like the then Earl of Holland, who by themselves or their families had brought an odium on the throne by the prodigal dispensation of its bounties toward them, who afterwards joined in the rebellions arising from the discontents of which they were themselves the cause; men who helped to subvert that throne to which they owed, some of them, their existence, others all that power which they employed to ruin their benefactor. If any bounds are set to the rapacious demands of that sort of people, or that others are permitted to partake in the objects they would engross, revenge and envy soon fill up the craving void that is left in their avarice. Confounded by the complication of distempered passions, their reason is disturbed; their views become vast and perplexed; to others inexplicable, to themselves uncertain. They find, on all sides, bounds to their unprincipled ambition in any fixed order of things. Both in the fog and haze of confusion all is enlarged and appears without any limit.
When men of rank sacrifice all ideas of dignity to an ambition without a distinct object and work with low instruments and for low ends, the whole composition becomes low and base. Does not something like this now appear in France? Does it not produce something ignoble and inglorious — a kind of meanness in all the prevalent policy, a tendency in all that is done to lower along with individuals all the dignity and importance of the state? Other revolutions have been conducted by persons who, whilst they attempted or affected changes in the commonwealth, sanctified their ambition by advancing the dignity of the people whose peace they troubled. They had long views. They aimed at the rule, not at the destruction, of their country. They were men of great civil and great military talents, and if the terror, the ornament of their age. They were not like Jew brokers, contending with each other who could best remedy with fraudulent circulation and depreciated paper the wretchedness and ruin brought on their country by their degenerate councils. The compliment made to one of the great bad men of the old stamp (Cromwell) by his kinsman, a favorite poet of that time, shows what it was he proposed, and what indeed to a great degree he accomplished, in the success of his ambition:
      Still as you rise, the state exalted too,
      Finds no distemper whilst 'tis changed by you;
      Changed like the world's great scene, when without noise
      The rising sun night's vulgar lights destroys.
These disturbers were not so much like men usurping power as asserting their natural place in society. Their rising was to illuminate and beautify the world. Their conquest over their competitors was by outshining them. The hand that, like a destroying angel, smote the country communicated to it the force and energy under which it suffered. I do not say (God forbid), I do not say that the virtues of such men were to be taken as a balance to their crimes; but they were some corrective to their effects. Such was, as I said, our Cromwell. Such were your whole race of Guises, Condes, and Colignis. Such the Richelieus, who in more quiet times acted in the spirit of a civil war. Such, as better men, and in a less dubious cause, were your Henry the Fourth and your Sully, though nursed in civil confusions and not wholly without some of their taint. It is a thing to be wondered at, to see how very soon France, when she had a moment to respire, recovered and emerged from the longest and most dreadful civil war that ever was known in any nation. Why? Because among all their massacres they had not slain the mind in their country. A conscious dignity, a noble pride, a generous sense of glory and emulation was not extinguished. On the contrary, it was kindled and inflamed. The organs also of the state, however shattered, existed. All the prizes of honor and virtue, all the rewards, all the distinctions remained. But your present confusion, like a palsy, has attacked the fountain of life itself. Every person in your country, in a situation to be actuated by a principle of honor, is disgraced and degraded, and can entertain no sensation of life except in a mortified and humiliated indignation. But this generation will quickly pass away. The next generation of the nobility will resemble the artificers and clowns, and money-jobbers usurers, and Jews, who will be always their fellows, sometimes their masters.
BELIEVE ME, SIR, those who attempt to level, never equalize. In all societies, consisting of various descriptions of citizens, some description must be uppermost. The levelers, therefore, only change and pervert the natural order of things; they load the edifice of society by setting up in the air what the solidity of the structure requires to be on the ground. The association of tailors and carpenters, of which the republic (of Paris, for instance) is composed, cannot be equal to the situation into which by the worst of usurpations — an usurpation on the prerogatives of nature  you attempt to force them.
The Chancellor of France, at the opening of the states, said, in a tone of oratorical flourish, that all occupations were honorable. If he meant only that no honest employment was disgraceful, he would not have gone beyond the truth. But in asserting that anything is honorable, we imply some distinction in its favor. The occupation of a hairdresser or of a working tallow-chandler cannot be a matter of honor to any person — to say nothing of a number of other more servile employments. Such descriptions of men ought not to suffer oppression from the state; but the state suffers oppression if such as they, either individually or collectively, are permitted to rule. In this you think you are combating prejudice, but you are at war with nature.
I do not determine whether this book be canonical, as the Gallican church (till lately) has considered it, or apocryphal, as here it is taken. I am sure it contains a great deal of sense and truth.
I do not, my dear Sir, conceive you to be of that sophistical, captious spirit, or of that uncandid dulness, as to require, for every general observation or sentiment, an explicit detail of the correctives and exceptions which reason will presume to be included in all the general propositions which come from reasonable men. You do not imagine that I wish to confine power, authority, and distinction to blood and names and titles. No, Sir. There is no qualification for government but virtue and wisdom, actual or presumptive. Wherever they are actually found, they have, in whatever state, condition, profession, or trade, the passport of Heaven to human place and honor. Woe to the country which would madly and impiously reject the service of the talents and virtues, civil, military, or religious, that are given to grace and to serve it, and would condemn to obscurity everything formed to diffuse luster and glory around a state. Woe to that country, too, that, passing into the opposite extreme, considers a low education, a mean contracted view of things, a sordid, mercenary occupation as a preferable title to command. Everything ought to be open, but not indifferently, to every man. No rotation; no appointment by lot; no mode of election operating in the spirit of sortition or rotation can be generally good in a government conversant in extensive objects. Because they have no tendency, direct or indirect, to select the man with a view to the duty or to accommodate the one to the other. I do not hesitate to say that the road to eminence and power, from obscure condition, ought not to be made too easy, nor a thing too much of course. If rare merit be the rarest of all rare things, it ought to pass through some sort of probation. The temple of honor ought to be seated on an eminence. If it be opened through virtue, let it be remembered, too, that virtue is never tried but by some difficulty and some struggle.
Nothing is a due and adequate representation of a state that does not represent its ability as well as its property. But as ability is a vigorous and active principle, and as property is sluggish, inert, and timid, it never can be safe from the invasion of ability unless it be, out of all proportion, predominant in the representation. It must be represented, too, in great masses of accumulation, or it is not rightly protected. The characteristic essence of property, formed out of the combined principles of its acquisition and conservation, is to be unequal. The great masses, therefore, which excite envy and tempt rapacity must be put out of the possibility of danger. Then they form a natural rampart about the lesser properties in all their gradations. The same quantity of property, which is by the natural course of things divided among many, has not the same operation. Its defensive power is weakened as it is diffused. In this diffusion each man's portion is less than what, in the eagerness of his desires, he may flatter himself to obtain by dissipating the accumulations of others. The plunder of the few would indeed give but a share inconceivably small in the distribution to the many. But the many are not capable of making this calculation; and those who lead them to rapine never intend this distribution.
The power of perpetuating our property in our families is one of the most valuable and interesting circumstances belonging to it, and that which tends the most to the perpetuation of society itself. It makes our weakness subservient to our virtue, it grafts benevolence even upon avarice. The possessors of family wealth, and of the distinction which attends hereditary possession (as most concerned in it), are the natural securities for this transmission. With us the House of Peers is formed upon this principle. It is wholly composed of hereditary property and hereditary distinction, and made, therefore, the third of the legislature and, in the last event, the sole judge of all property in all its subdivisions. The House of Commons, too, though not necessarily, yet in fact, is always so composed, in the far greater part. Let those large proprietors be what they will — and they have their chance of being amongst the best — they are, at the very worst, the ballast in the vessel of the commonwealth. For though hereditary wealth and the rank which goes with it are too much idolized by creeping sycophants and the blind, abject admirers of power, they are too rashly slighted in shallow speculations of the petulant, assuming, short-sighted coxcombs of philosophy. Some decent, regulated preeminence, some preference (not exclusive appropriation) given to birth is neither unnatural, nor unjust, nor impolitic.
IT is said that twenty-four millions ought to prevail over two hundred thousand. True; if the constitution of a kingdom be a problem of arithmetic. This sort of discourse does well enough with the lamp-post for its second; to men who may reason calmly, it is ridiculous. The will of the many and their interest must very often differ, and great will be the difference when they make an evil choice. A government of five hundred country attornies and obscure curates is not good for twenty-four millions of men, though it were chosen by eight and forty millions, nor is it the better for being guided by a dozen of persons of quality who have betrayed their trust in order to obtain that power. At present, you seem in everything to have strayed out of the high road of nature. The property of France does not govern it. Of course, property is destroyed and rational liberty has no existence. All you have got for the present is a paper circulation and a stock-jobbing constitution; and as to the future, do you seriously think that the territory of France, upon the republican system of eighty-three independent municipalities (to say nothing of the parts that compose them), can ever be governed as one body or can ever be set in motion by the impulse of one mind? When the National Assembly has completed its work, it will have accomplished its ruin. These commonwealths will not long bear a state of subjection to the republic of Paris. They will not bear that this body should monopolize the captivity of the king and the dominion over the assembly calling itself national. Each will keep its own portion of the spoil of the church to itself, and it will not suffer either that spoil, or the more just fruits of their industry, or the natural produce of their soil to be sent to swell the insolence or pamper the luxury of the mechanics of Paris. In this they will see none of the equality, under the pretense of which they have been tempted to throw off their allegiance to their sovereign as well as the ancient constitution of their country. There can be no capital city in such a constitution as they have lately made. They have forgot that, when they framed democratic governments, they had virtually dismembered their country. The person whom they persevere in calling king has not power left to him by the hundredth part sufficient to hold together this collection of republics. The republic of Paris will endeavor, indeed, to complete the debauchery of the army, and illegally to perpetuate the assembly, without resort to its constituents, as the means of continuing its despotism. It will make efforts, by becoming the heart of a boundless paper circulation, to draw everything to itself; but in vain. All this policy in the end will appear as feeble as it is now violent.
IF this be your actual situation, compared to the situation to which you were called, as it were, by the voice of God and man, I cannot find it in my heart to congratulate you on the choice you have made or the success which has attended your endeavors. I can as little recommend to any other nation a conduct grounded on such principles, and productive of such effects. That I must leave to those who can see farther into your affairs than I am able to do, and who best know how far your actions are favorable to their designs. The gentlemen of the Revolution Society, who were so early in their congratulations, appear to be strongly of opinion that there is some scheme of politics relative to this country in which your proceedings may, in some way, be useful. For your Dr. Price, who seems to have speculated himself into no small degree of fervor upon this subject, addresses his auditory in the following very remarkable words: ""I cannot conclude without recalling particularly to your recollection a consideration which I have more than once alluded to, and which probably your thoughts have been all along anticipating; a consideration with which my mind is impressed more than I can express. I mean the consideration of the favourableness of the present times to all exertions in the cause of liberty.""
It is plain that the mind of this political preacher was at the time big with some extraordinary design; and it is very probable that the thoughts of his audience, who understood him better than I do, did all along run before him in his reflection and in the whole train of consequences to which it led.
Before I read that sermon, I really thought I had lived in a free country; and it was an error I cherished, because it gave me a greater liking to the country I lived in. I was, indeed, aware that a jealous, ever-waking vigilance to guard the treasure of our liberty, not only from invasion, but from decay and corruption, was our best wisdom and our first duty. However, I considered that treasure rather as a possession to be secured than as a prize to be contended for. I did not discern how the present time came to be so very favorable to all exertions in the cause of freedom. The present time differs from any other only by the circumstance of what is doing in France. If the example of that nation is to have an influence on this, I can easily conceive why some of their proceedings which have an unpleasant aspect and are not quite reconcilable to humanity, generosity, good faith, and justice are palliated with so much milky good-nature toward the actors, and borne with so much heroic fortitude toward the sufferers. It is certainly not prudent to discredit the authority of an example we mean to follow. But allowing this, we are led to a very natural question: What is that cause of liberty, and what are those exertions in its favor to which the example of France is so singularly auspicious? Is our monarchy to be annihilated, with all the laws, all the tribunals, and all the ancient corporations of the kingdom? Is every landmark of the country to be done away in favor of a geometrical and arithmetical constitution? Is the House of Lords to be voted useless? Is episcopacy to be abolished? Are the church lands to be sold to Jews and jobbers or given to bribe new-invented municipal republics into a participation in sacrilege? Are all the taxes to be voted grievances, and the revenue reduced to a patriotic contribution or patriotic presents? Are silver shoebuckles to be substituted in the place of the land tax and the malt tax for the support of the naval strength of this kingdom? Are all orders, ranks, and distinctions to be confounded, that out of universal anarchy, joined to national bankruptcy, three or four thousand democracies should be formed into eighty-three, and that they may all, by some sort of unknown attractive power, be organized into one?
For this great end, is the army to be seduced from its discipline and its fidelity, first, by every kind of debauchery and, then, by the terrible precedent of a donative in the increase of pay? Are the curates to be seduced from their bishops by holding out to them the delusive hope of a dole out of the spoils of their own order? Are the citizens of London to be drawn from their allegiance by feeding them at the expense of their fellow subjects? Is a compulsory paper currency to be substituted in the place of the legal coin of this kingdom? Is what remains of the plundered stock of public revenue to be employed in the wild project of maintaining two armies to watch over and to fight with each other? If these are the ends and means of the Revolution Society, I admit that they are well assorted; and France may furnish them for both with precedents in point.
I see that your example is held out to shame us. I know that we are supposed a dull, sluggish race, rendered passive by finding our situation tolerable, and prevented by a mediocrity of freedom from ever attaining to its full perfection. Your leaders in France began by affecting to admire, almost to adore, the British constitution; but as they advanced, they came to look upon it with a sovereign contempt. The friends of your National Assembly among us have full as mean an opinion of what was formerly thought the glory of their country. The Revolution Society has discovered that the English nation is not free. They are convinced that the inequality in our representation is a ""defect in our constitution so gross and palpable as to make it excellent chiefly in form and theory"". That a representation in the legislature of a kingdom is not only the basis of all constitutional liberty in it, but of ""all legitimate government; that without it a government is nothing but an usurpation""; — that ""when the representation is partial, the kingdom possesses liberty only partially; and if extremely partial, it gives only a semblance; and if not only extremely partial, but corruptly chosen, it becomes a nuisance"". Dr. Price considers this inadequacy of representation as our fundamental grievance; and though, as to the corruption of this semblance of representation, he hopes it is not yet arrived to its full perfection of depravity, he fears that ""nothing will be done towards gaining for us this essential blessing, until some great abuse of power again provokes our resentment, or some great calamity again alarms our fears, or perhaps till the acquisition of a pure and equal representation by other countries, whilst we are mocked with the shadow, kindles our shame."" To this he subjoins a note in these words. ""A representation chosen chiefly by the treasury, and a few thousands of the dregs of the people, who are generally paid for their votes"".
You will smile here at the consistency of those democratists who, when they are not on their guard, treat the humbler part of the community with the greatest contempt, whilst, at the same time, they pretend to make them the depositories of all power. It would require a long discourse to point out to you the many fallacies that lurk in the generality and equivocal nature of the terms ""inadequate representation"". I shall only say here, in justice to that old-fashioned constitution under which we have long prospered, that our representation has been found perfectly adequate to all the purposes for which a representation of the people can be desired or devised. I defy the enemies of our constitution to show the contrary. To detail the particulars in which it is found so well to promote its ends would demand a treatise on our practical constitution. I state here the doctrine of the Revolutionists only that you and others may see what an opinion these gentlemen entertain of the constitution of their country, and why they seem to think that some great abuse of power or some great calamity, as giving a chance for the blessing of a constitution according to their ideas, would be much palliated to their feelings; you see why they are so much enamored of your fair and equal representation, which being once obtained, the same effects might follow. You see they consider our House of Commons as only ""a semblance"", ""a form"", ""a theory"", ""a shadow"", ""a mockery"", perhaps ""a nuisance"".
These gentlemen value themselves on being systematic, and not without reason. They must therefore look on this gross and palpable defect of representation, this fundamental grievance (so they call it) as a thing not only vicious in itself, but as rendering our whole government absolutely illegitimate, and not at all better than a downright usurpation. Another revolution, to get rid of this illegitimate and usurped government, would of course be perfectly justifiable, if not absolutely necessary. Indeed, their principle, if you observe it with any attention, goes much further than to an alteration in the election of the House of Commons; for, if popular representation, or choice, is necessary to the legitimacy of all government, the House of Lords is, at one stroke, bastardized and corrupted in blood. That House is no representative of the people at all, even in ""semblance or in form"". The case of the crown is altogether as bad. In vain the crown may endeavor to screen itself against these gentlemen by the authority of the establishment made on the Revolution. The Revolution which is resorted to for a title, on their system, wants a title itself. The Revolution is built, according to their theory, upon a basis not more solid than our present formalities, as it was made by a House of Lords, not representing anyone but themselves, and by a House of Commons exactly such as the present, that is, as they term it, by a mere ""shadow and mockery"" of representation.
Something they must destroy, or they seem to themselves to exist for no purpose. One set is for destroying the civil power through the ecclesiastical; another, for demolishing the ecclesiastic through the civil. They are aware that the worst consequences might happen to the public in accomplishing this double ruin of church and state, but they are so heated with their theories that they give more than hints that this ruin, with all the mischiefs that must lead to it and attend it, and which to themselves appear quite certain, would not be unacceptable to them or very remote from their wishes. A man amongst them of great authority and certainly of great talents, speaking of a supposed alliance between church and state, says, ""perhaps we must wait for the fall of the civil powers before this most unnatural alliance be broken. Calamitous no doubt will that time be. But what convulsion in the political world ought to be a subject of lamentation if it be attended with so desirable an effect?"" You see with what a steady eye these gentlemen are prepared to view the greatest calamities which can befall their country.
IT is no wonder, therefore, that with these ideas of everything in their constitution and government at home, either in church or state, as illegitimate and usurped, or at best as a vain mockery, they look abroad with an eager and passionate enthusiasm. Whilst they are possessed by these notions, it is vain to talk to them of the practice of their ancestors, the fundamental laws of their country, the fixed form of a constitution whose merits are confirmed by the solid test of long experience and an increasing public strength and national prosperity. They despise experience as the wisdom of unlettered men; and as for the rest, they have wrought underground a mine that will blow up, at one grand explosion, all examples of antiquity, all precedents, charters, and acts of parliament. They have ""the rights of men"". Against these there can be no prescription, against these no agreement is binding; these admit no temperament and no compromise; anything withheld from their full demand is so much of fraud and injustice. Against these their rights of men let no government look for security in the length of its continuance, or in the justice and lenity of its administration. The objections of these speculatists, if its forms do not quadrate with their theories, are as valid against such an old and beneficent government as against the most violent tyranny or the greenest usurpation. They are always at issue with governments, not on a question of abuse, but a question of competency and a question of title. I have nothing to say to the clumsy subtilty of their political metaphysics. Let them be their amusement in the schools. — ""Illa se jactet in aula Aeolus, et clauso ventorum carcere regnet"". — But let them not break prison to burst like a Levanter to sweep the earth with their hurricane and to break up the fountains of the great deep to overwhelm us.
Far am I from denying in theory, full as far is my heart from withholding in practice (if I were of power to give or to withhold) the real rights of men. In denying their false claims of right, I do not mean to injure those which are real, and are such as their pretended rights would totally destroy. If civil society be made for the advantage of man, all the advantages for which it is made become his right. It is an institution of beneficence; and law itself is only beneficence acting by a rule. Men have a right to live by that rule; they have a right to do justice, as between their fellows, whether their fellows are in public function or in ordinary occupation. They have a right to the fruits of their industry and to the means of making their industry fruitful. They have a right to the acquisitions of their parents, to the nourishment and improvement of their offspring, to instruction in life, and to consolation in death. Whatever each man can separately do, without trespassing upon others, he has a right to do for himself; and he has a right to a fair portion of all which society, with all its combinations of skill and force, can do in his favor. In this partnership all men have equal rights, but not to equal things. He that has but five shillings in the partnership has as good a right to it as he that has five hundred pounds has to his larger proportion. But he has not a right to an equal dividend in the product of the joint stock; and as to the share of power, authority, and direction which each individual ought to have in the management of the state, that I must deny to be amongst the direct original rights of man in civil society; for I have in my contemplation the civil social man, and no other. It is a thing to be settled by convention.
If civil society be the offspring of convention, that convention must be its law. That convention must limit and modify all the descriptions of constitution which are formed under it. Every sort of legislative, judicial, or executory power are its creatures. They can have no being in any other state of things; and how can any man claim under the conventions of civil society rights which do not so much as suppose its existence — rights which are absolutely repugnant to it? One of the first motives to civil society, and which becomes one of its fundamental rules, is that no man should be judge in his own cause. By this each person has at once divested himself of the first fundamental right of uncovenanted man, that is, to judge for himself and to assert his own cause. He abdicates all right to be his own governor. He inclusively, in a great measure, abandons the right of self-defense, the first law of nature. Men cannot enjoy the rights of an uncivil and of a civil state together. That he may obtain justice, he gives up his right of determining what it is in points the most essential to him. That he may secure some liberty, he makes a surrender in trust of the whole of it.
Government is not made in virtue of natural rights, which may and do exist in total independence of it, and exist in much greater clearness and in a much greater degree of abstract perfection; but their abstract perfection is their practical defect. By having a right to everything they want everything. Government is a contrivance of human wisdom to provide for human wants. Men have a right that these wants should be provided for by this wisdom. Among these wants is to be reckoned the want, out of civil society, of a sufficient restraint upon their passions. Society requires not only that the passions of individuals should be subjected, but that even in the mass and body, as well as in the individuals, the inclinations of men should frequently be thwarted, their will controlled, and their passions brought into subjection. This can only be done by a power out of themselves, and not, in the exercise of its function, subject to that will and to those passions which it is its office to bridle and subdue. In this sense the restraints on men, as well as their liberties, are to be reckoned among their rights. But as the liberties and the restrictions vary with times and circumstances and admit to infinite modifications, they cannot be settled upon any abstract rule; and nothing is so foolish as to discuss them upon that principle.
The moment you abate anything from the full rights of men, each to govern himself, and suffer any artificial, positive limitation upon those rights, from that moment the whole organization of government becomes a consideration of convenience. This it is which makes the constitution of a state and the due distribution of its powers a matter of the most delicate and complicated skill. It requires a deep knowledge of human nature and human necessities, and of the things which facilitate or obstruct the various ends which are to be pursued by the mechanism of civil institutions. The state is to have recruits to its strength, and remedies to its distempers. What is the use of discussing a man's abstract right to food or medicine? The question is upon the method of procuring and administering them. In that deliberation I shall always advise to call in the aid of the farmer and the physician rather than the professor of metaphysics.
The science of constructing a commonwealth, or renovating it, or reforming it, is, like every other experimental science, not to be taught a priori. Nor is it a short experience that can instruct us in that practical science, because the real effects of moral causes are not always immediate; but that which in the first instance is prejudicial may be excellent in its remoter operation, and its excellence may arise even from the ill effects it produces in the beginning. The reverse also happens: and very plausible schemes, with very pleasing commencements, have often shameful and lamentable conclusions. In states there are often some obscure and almost latent causes, things which appear at first view of little moment, on which a very great part of its prosperity or adversity may most essentially depend. The science of government being therefore so practical in itself and intended for such practical purposes — a matter which requires experience, and even more experience than any person can gain in his whole life, however sagacious and observing he may be — it is with infinite caution that any man ought to venture upon pulling down an edifice which has answered in any tolerable degree for ages the common purposes of society, or on building it up again without having models and patterns of approved utility before his eyes.
These metaphysic rights entering into common life, like rays of light which pierce into a dense medium, are by the laws of nature refracted from their straight line. Indeed, in the gross and complicated mass of human passions and concerns the primitive rights of men undergo such a variety of refractions and reflections that it becomes absurd to talk of them as if they continued in the simplicity of their original direction. The nature of man is intricate; the objects of society are of the greatest possible complexity; and, therefore, no simple disposition or direction of power can be suitable either to man's nature or to the quality of his affairs. When I hear the simplicity of contrivance aimed at and boasted of in any new political constitutions, I am at no loss to decide that the artificers are grossly ignorant of their trade or totally negligent of their duty. The simple governments are fundamentally defective, to say no worse of them. If you were to contemplate society in but one point of view, all these simple modes of polity are infinitely captivating. In effect each would answer its single end much more perfectly than the more complex is able to attain all its complex purposes. But it is better that the whole should be imperfectly and anomalously answered than that, while some parts are provided for with great exactness, others might be totally neglected or perhaps materially injured by the over-care of a favorite member.
The pretended rights of these theorists are all extremes; and in proportion as they are metaphysically true, they are morally and politically false. The rights of men are in a sort of middle, incapable of definition, but not impossible to be discerned. The rights of men in governments are their advantages; and these are often in balances between differences of good, in compromises sometimes between good and evil, and sometimes between evil and evil. Political reason is a computing principle: adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing, morally and not metaphysically or mathematically, true moral denominations.
By these theorists the right of the people is almost always sophistically confounded with their power. The body of the community, whenever it can come to act, can meet with no effectual resistance; but till power and right are the same, the whole body of them has no right inconsistent with virtue, and the first of all virtues, prudence. Men have no right to what is not reasonable and to what is not for their benefit; for though a pleasant writer said, liceat perire poetis, when one of them, in cold blood, is said to have leaped into the flames of a volcanic revolution, ardentem frigidus Aetnam insiluit, I consider such a frolic rather as an unjustifiable poetic license than as one of the franchises of Parnassus; and whether he was a poet, or divine, or politician that chose to exercise this kind of right, I think that more wise, because more charitable, thoughts would urge me rather to save the man than to preserve his brazen slippers as the monuments of his folly.
The kind of anniversary sermons to which a great part of what I write refers, if men are not shamed out of their present course in commemorating the fact, will cheat many out of the principles, and deprive them of the benefits, of the revolution they commemorate. I confess to you, Sir, I never liked this continual talk of resistance and revolution, or the practice of making the extreme medicine of the constitution its daily bread. It renders the habit of society dangerously valetudinary; it is taking periodical doses of mercury sublimate and swallowing down repeated provocatives of cantharides to our love of liberty.
This distemper of remedy, grown habitual, relaxes and wears out, by a vulgar and prostituted use, the spring of that spirit which is to be exerted on great occasions. It was in the most patient period of Roman servitude that themes of tyrannicide made the ordinary exercise of boys at school cum perimit saevos classis numerosa tyrannos. In the ordinary state of things, it produces in a country like ours the worst effects, even on the cause of that liberty which it abuses with the dissoluteness of an extravagant speculation. Almost all the high-bred republicans of my time have, after a short space, become the most decided, thorough-paced courtiers; they soon left the business of a tedious, moderate, but practical resistance to those of us whom, in the pride and intoxication of their theories, they have slighted as not much better than Tories. Hypocrisy, of course, delights in the most sublime speculations, for, never intending to go beyond speculation, it costs nothing to have it magnificent. But even in cases where rather levity than fraud was to be suspected in these ranting speculations, the issue has been much the same. These professors, finding their extreme principles not applicable to cases which call only for a qualified or, as I may say, civil and legal resistance, in such cases employ no resistance at all. It is with them a war or a revolution, or it is nothing. Finding their schemes of politics not adapted to the state of the world in which they live, they often come to think lightly of all public principle, and are ready, on their part, to abandon for a very trivial interest what they find of very trivial value. Some, indeed, are of more steady and persevering natures, but these are eager politicians out of parliament who have little to tempt them to abandon their favorite projects. They have some change in the church or state, or both, constantly in their view. When that is the case, they are always bad citizens and perfectly unsure connections. For, considering their speculative designs as of infinite value, and the actual arrangement of the state as of no estimation, they are at best indifferent about it. They see no merit in the good, and no fault in the vicious, management of public affairs; they rather rejoice in the latter, as more propitious to revolution. They see no merit or demerit in any man, or any action, or any political principle any further than as they may forward or retard their design of change; they therefore take up, one day, the most violent and stretched prerogative, and another time the wildest democratic ideas of freedom, and pass from one to the other without any sort of regard to cause, to person, or to party.
IN FRANCE, you are now in the crisis of a revolution and in the transit from one form of government to another — you cannot see that character of men exactly in the same situation in which we see it in this country. With us it is militant; with you it is triumphant; and you know how it can act when its power is commensurate to its will. I would not be supposed to confine those observations to any description of men or to comprehend all men of any description within them — No! far from it. I am as incapable of that injustice as I am of keeping terms with those who profess principles of extremities and who, under the name of religion, teach little else than wild and dangerous politics. The worst of these politics of revolution is this: they temper and harden the breast in order to prepare it for the desperate strokes which are sometimes used in extreme occasions. But as these occasions may never arrive, the mind receives a gratuitous taint; and the moral sentiments suffer not a little when no political purpose is served by the depravation. This sort of people are so taken up with their theories about the rights of man that they have totally forgotten his nature. Without opening one new avenue to the understanding, they have succeeded in stopping up those that lead to the heart. They have perverted in themselves, and in those that attend to them, all the well-placed sympathies of the human breast.
This famous sermon of the Old Jewry breathes nothing but this spirit through all the political part. Plots, massacres, assassinations seem to some people a trivial price for obtaining a revolution. Cheap, bloodless reformation, a guiltless liberty appear flat and vapid to their taste. There must be a great change of scene; there must be a magnificent stage effect; there must be a grand spectacle to rouse the imagination grown torpid with the lazy enjoyment of sixty years' security and the still unanimating repose of public prosperity. The preacher found them all in the French Revolution. This inspires a juvenile warmth through his whole frame. His enthusiasm kindles as he advances; and when he arrives at his peroration it is in a full blaze. Then viewing, from the Pisgah of his pulpit, the free, moral, happy, flourishing and glorious state of France as in a bird's-eye landscape of a promised land, he breaks out into the following rapture: What an eventful period is this! I am thankful that I have lived to it; I could almost say, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation. — I have lived to see a diffusion of knowledge, which has undermined superstition and error. — I have lived to see the rights of men better understood than ever; and nations panting for liberty which seemed to have lost the idea of it. — I have lived to see thirty millions of people, indignant and resolute, spurning at slavery, and demanding liberty with an irresistible voice. Their king led in triumph and an arbitrary monarch surrendering himself to his subjects.
Before I proceed further, I have to remark that Dr. Price seems rather to overvalue the great acquisitions of light which he has obtained and diffused in this age. The last century appears to me to have been quite as much enlightened. It had, though in a different place, a triumph as memorable as that of Dr. Price; and some of the great preachers of that period partook of it as eagerly as he has done in the triumph of France. On the trial of the Rev. Hugh Peters for high treason, it was deposed that, when King Charles was brought to London for his trial, the Apostle of Liberty in that day conducted the triumph. ""I saw"", says the witness, ""his Majesty in the coach with six horses, and Peters riding before the king, triumphing"". Dr. Price, when he talks as if he had made a discovery, only follows a precedent, for after the commencement of the king's trial this precursor, the same Dr. Peters, concluding a long prayer at the Royal Chapel at Whitehall (he had very triumphantly chosen his place), said, ""I have prayed and preached these twenty years; and now I may say with old Simeon, Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, for mine eyes have seen thy salvation"".  Peters had not the fruits of his prayer, for he neither departed so soon as he wished, nor in peace. He became (what I heartily hope none of his followers may be in this country) himself a sacrifice to the triumph which he led as pontiff.
They dealt at the Restoration, perhaps, too hardly with this poor good man. But we owe it to his memory and his sufferings that he had as much illumination and as much zeal, and had as effectually undermined all the superstition and error which might impede the great business he was engaged in, as any who follow and repeat after him in this age, which would assume to itself an exclusive title to the knowledge of the rights of men and all the glorious consequences of that knowledge.
After this sally of the preacher of the Old Jewry, which differs only in place and time, but agrees perfectly with the spirit and letter of the rapture of 1648, the Revolution Society, the fabricators of governments, the heroic band of cashierers of monarchs, electors of sovereigns, and leaders of kings in triumph, strutting with a proud consciousness of the diffusion of knowledge of which every member had obtained so large a share in the donative, were in haste to make a generous diffusion of the knowledge they had thus gratuitously received. To make this bountiful communication, they adjourned from the church in the Old Jewry to the London Tavern, where the same Dr. Price, in whom the fumes of his oracular tripod were not entirely evaporated, moved and carried the resolution or address of congratulation transmitted by Lord Stanhope to the National Assembly of France.
I find a preacher of the gospel profaning the beautiful and prophetic ejaculation, commonly called ""nunc dimittis"", made on the first presentation of our Saviour in the Temple, and applying it with an inhuman and unnatural rapture to the most horrid, atrocious, and afflicting spectacle that perhaps ever was exhibited to the pity and indignation of mankind. This ""leading in triumph"", a thing in its best form unmanly and irreligious, which fills our preacher with such unhallowed transports, must shock, I believe, the moral taste of every well-born mind. Several English were the stupefied and indignant spectators of that triumph. It was (unless we have been strangely deceived) a spectacle more resembling a procession of American savages, entering into Onondaga after some of their murders called victories and leading into hovels hung round with scalps their captives, overpowered with the scoffs and buffets of women as ferocious as themselves, much more than it resembled the triumphal pomp of a civilized martial nation — if a civilized nation, or any men who had a sense of generosity, were capable of a personal triumph over the fallen and afflicted.
THIS, MY DEAR SIR, was not the triumph of France. I must believe that, as a nation, it overwhelmed you with shame and horror. I must believe that the National Assembly find themselves in a state of the greatest humiliation in not being able to punish the authors of this triumph or the actors in it, and that they are in a situation in which any inquiry they may make upon the subject must be destitute even of the appearance of liberty or impartiality. The apology of that assembly is found in their situation; but when we approve what they must bear, it is in us the degenerate choice of a vitiated mind.
With a compelled appearance of deliberation, they vote under the dominion of a stern necessity. They sit in the heart, as it were, of a foreign republic: they have their residence in a city whose constitution has emanated neither from the charter of their king nor from their legislative power. There they are surrounded by an army not raised either by the authority of their crown or by their command, and which, if they should order to dissolve itself, would instantly dissolve them. There they sit, after a gang of assassins had driven away some hundreds of the members, whilst those who held the same moderate principles, with more patience or better hope, continued every day exposed to outrageous insults and murderous threats. There a majority, sometimes real, sometimes pretended, captive itself, compels a captive king to issue as royal edicts, at third hand, the polluted nonsense of their most licentious and giddy coffeehouses. It is notorious that all their measures are decided before they are debated. It is beyond doubt that, under the terror of the bayonet and the lamp-post and the torch to their houses, they are obliged to adopt all the crude and desperate measures suggested by clubs composed of a monstrous medley of all conditions, tongues, and nations. Among these are found persons, in comparison of whom Catiline would be thought scrupulous and Cethegus a man of sobriety and moderation. Nor is it in these clubs alone that the public measures are deformed into monsters. They undergo a previous distortion in academies, intended as so many seminaries for these clubs, which are set up in all the places of public resort. In these meetings of all sorts every counsel, in proportion as it is daring and violent and perfidious, is taken for the mark of superior genius. Humanity and compassion are ridiculed as the fruits of superstition and ignorance. Tenderness to individuals is considered as treason to the public. Liberty is always to be estimated perfect, as property is rendered insecure. Amidst assassination, massacre, and confiscation, perpetrated or meditated, they are forming plans for the good order of future society. Embracing in their arms the carcasses of base criminals and promoting their relations on the title of their offences, they drive hundreds of virtuous persons to the same end, by forcing them to subsist by beggary or by crime.
The Assembly, their organ, acts before them the farce of deliberation with as little decency as liberty. They act like the comedians of a fair before a riotous audience; they act amidst the tumultuous cries of a mixed mob of ferocious men, and of women lost to shame, who, according to their insolent fancies, direct, control, applaud, explode them, and sometimes mix and take their seats amongst them, domineering over them with a strange mixture of servile petulance and proud, presumptuous authority. As they have inverted order in all things, the gallery is in the place of the house. This assembly, which overthrows kings and kingdoms, has not even the physiognomy and aspect of a grave legislative body — nec color imperii, nec frons ulla senatus. They have a power given to them, like that of the evil principle, to subvert and destroy, but none to construct, except such machines as may be fitted for further subversion and further destruction.
WHO is it that admires, and from the heart is attached to, national representative assemblies, but must turn with horror and disgust from such a profane burlesque, and abominable perversion of that sacred institute? Lovers of monarchy, lovers of republics must alike abhor it. The members of your assembly must themselves groan under the tyranny of which they have all the shame, none of the direction, and little of the profit. I am sure many of the members who compose even the majority of that body must feel as I do, notwithstanding the applauses of the Revolution Society. Miserable king! miserable assembly! How must that assembly be silently scandalized with those of their members who could call a day which seemed to blot the sun out of heaven ""un beau jour!"" How must they be inwardly indignant at hearing others who thought fit to declare to them ""that the vessel of the state would fly forward in her course toward regeneration with more speed than ever"", from the stiff gale of treason and murder which preceded our preacher's triumph! What must they have felt whilst, with outward patience and inward indignation, they heard, of the slaughter of innocent gentlemen in their houses, that ""the blood spilled was not the most pure!"" What must they have felt, when they were besieged by complaints of disorders which shook their country to its foundations, at being compelled coolly to tell the complainants that they were under the protection of the law, and that they would address the king (the captive king) to cause the laws to be enforced for their protection; when the enslaved ministers of that captive king had formally notified to them that there were neither law nor authority nor power left to protect? What must they have felt at being obliged, as a felicitation on the present new year, to request their captive king to forget the stormy period of the last, on account of the great good which he was likely to produce to his people; to the complete attainment of which good they adjourned the practical demonstrations of their loyalty, assuring him of their obedience when he should no longer possess any authority to command?
This address was made with much good nature and affection, to be sure. But among the revolutions in France must be reckoned a considerable revolution in their ideas of politeness. In England we are said to learn manners at second-hand from your side of the water, and that we dress our behavior in the frippery of France. If so, we are still in the old cut and have not so far conformed to the new Parisian mode of good breeding as to think it quite in the most refined strain of delicate compliment (whether in condolence or congratulation) to say, to the most humiliated creature that crawls upon the earth, that great public benefits are derived from the murder of his servants, the attempted assassination of himself and of his wife, and the mortification, disgrace, and degradation that he has personally suffered. It is a topic of consolation which our ordinary of Newgate would be too humane to use to a criminal at the foot of the gallows. I should have thought that the hangman of Paris, now that he is liberalized by the vote of the National Assembly and is allowed his rank and arms in the herald's college of the rights of men, would be too generous, too gallant a man, too full of the sense of his new dignity to employ that cutting consolation to any of the persons whom the lese nation might bring under the administration of his executive power.
A man is fallen indeed when he is thus flattered. The anodyne draught of oblivion, thus drugged, is well calculated to preserve a galling wakefulness and to feed the living ulcer of a corroding memory. Thus to administer the opiate potion of amnesty, powdered with all the ingredients of scorn and contempt, is to hold to his lips, instead of ""the balm of hurt minds"", the cup of human misery full to the brim and to force him to drink it to the dregs.
Yielding to reasons at least as forcible as those which were so delicately urged in the compliment on the new year, the king of France will probably endeavor to forget these events and that compliment. But history, who keeps a durable record of all our acts and exercises her awful censure over the proceedings of all sorts of sovereigns, will not forget either those events or the era of this liberal refinement in the intercourse of mankind. History will record that on the morning of the 6th of October, 1789, the king and queen of France, after a day of confusion, alarm, dismay, and slaughter, lay down, under the pledged security of public faith, to indulge nature in a few hours of respite and troubled, melancholy repose. From this sleep the queen was first startled by the sentinel at her door, who cried out to her to save herself by flight — that this was the last proof of fidelity he could give — that they were upon him, and he was dead. Instantly he was cut down. A band of cruel ruffians and assassins, reeking with his blood, rushed into the chamber of the queen and pierced with a hundred strokes of bayonets and poniards the bed, from whence this persecuted woman had but just time to fly almost naked, and, through ways unknown to the murderers, had escaped to seek refuge at the feet of a king and husband not secure of his own life for a moment.
This king, to say no more of him, and this queen, and their infant children (who once would have been the pride and hope of a great and generous people) were then forced to abandon the sanctuary of the most splendid palace in the world, which they left swimming in blood, polluted by massacre and strewed with scattered limbs and mutilated carcasses. Thence they were conducted into the capital of their kingdom.
Two had been selected from the unprovoked, unresisted, promiscuous slaughter, which was made of the gentlemen of birth and family who composed the king's body guard. These two gentlemen, with all the parade of an execution of justice, were cruelly and publicly dragged to the block and beheaded in the great court of the palace. Their heads were stuck upon spears and led the procession, whilst the royal captives who followed in the train were slowly moved along, amidst the horrid yells, and shrilling screams, and frantic dances, and infamous contumelies, and all the unutterable abominations of the furies of hell in the abused shape of the vilest of women. After they had been made to taste, drop by drop, more than the bitterness of death in the slow torture of a journey of twelve miles, protracted to six hours, they were, under a guard composed of those very soldiers who had thus conducted them through this famous triumph, lodged in one of the old palaces of Paris, now converted into a bastille for kings.
Is this a triumph to be consecrated at altars? to be commemorated with grateful thanksgiving? to be offered to the divine humanity with fervent prayer and enthusiastic ejaculation? ? These Theban and Thracian orgies, acted in France and applauded only in the Old Jewry, I assure you, kindle prophetic enthusiasm in the minds but of very few people in this kingdom, although a saint and apostle, who may have revelations of his own and who has so completely vanquished all the mean superstitions of the heart, may incline to think it pious and decorous to compare it with the entrance into the world of the Prince of Peace, proclaimed in a holy temple by a venerable sage, and not long before not worse announced by the voice of angels to the quiet innocence of shepherds.
At first I was at a loss to account for this fit of unguarded transport. I knew, indeed, that the sufferings of monarchs make a delicious repast to some sort of palates. There were reflections which might serve to keep this appetite within some bounds of temperance. But when I took one circumstance into my consideration, I was obliged to confess that much allowance ought to be made for the Society, and that the temptation was too strong for common discretion I mean, the circumstance of the Io Paean of the triumph, the animating cry which called ""for all the BISHOPS to be hanged on the lampposts"", might well have brought forth a burst of enthusiasm on the foreseen consequences of this happy day. I allow to so much enthusiasm some little deviation from prudence. I allow this prophet to break forth into hymns of joy and thanksgiving on an event which appears like the precursor of the Millennium and the projected fifth monarchy in the destruction of all church establishments.
There was, however, (as in all human affairs there is) in the midst of this joy something to exercise the patience of these worthy gentlemen and to try the long-suffering of their faith. The actual murder of the king and queen, and their child, was wanting to the other auspicious circumstances of this ""beautiful day"". The actual murder of the bishops, though called for by so many holy ejaculations, was also wanting. A group of regicide and sacrilegious slaughter was indeed boldly sketched, but it was only sketched. It unhappily was left unfinished in this great history-piece of the massacre of innocents. What hardy pencil of a great master from the school of the rights of man will finish it is to be seen hereafter. The age has not yet the complete benefit of that diffusion of knowledge that has undermined superstition and error; and the king of France wants another object or two to consign to oblivion, in consideration of all the good which is to arise from his own sufferings and the patriotic crimes of an enlightened age.

This military man had not so good nerves as the peaceable gentleman of the Old Jewry. — See Mons. Mounier's narrative of these transactions; a man also of honour and virtue, and talents, and therefore a fugitive.
Although this work of our new light and knowledge did not go to the length that in all probability it was intended it should be carried, yet I must think that such treatment of any human creatures must be shocking to any but those who are made for accomplishing revolutions. But I cannot stop here. Influenced by the inborn feelings of my nature, and not being illuminated by a single ray of this new-sprung modern light, I confess to you, Sir, that the exalted rank of the persons suffering, and particularly the sex, the beauty, and the amiable qualities of the descendant of so many kings and emperors, with the tender age of royal infants, insensible only through infancy and innocence of the cruel outrages to which their parents were exposed, instead of being a subject of exultation, adds not a little to any sensibility on that most melancholy occasion.
I hear that the august person who was the principal object of our preacher's triumph, though he supported himself, felt much on that shameful occasion. As a man, it became him to feel for his wife and his children, and the faithful guards of his person that were massacred in cold blood about him; as a prince, it became him to feel for the strange and frightful transformation of his civilized subjects, and to be more grieved for them than solicitous for himself. It derogates little from his fortitude, while it adds infinitely to the honor of his humanity. I am very sorry to say it, very sorry indeed, that such personages are in a situation in which it is not unbecoming in us to praise the virtues of the great.
I hear, and I rejoice to hear, that the great lady, the other object of the triumph, has borne that day (one is interested that beings made for suffering should suffer well), and that she bears all the succeeding days, that she bears the imprisonment of her husband, and her own captivity, and the exile of her friends, and the insulting adulation of addresses, and the whole weight of her accumulated wrongs, with a serene patience, in a manner suited to her rank and race, and becoming the offspring of a sovereign distinguished for her piety and her courage; that, like her, she has lofty sentiments; that she feels with the dignity of a Roman matron; that in the last extremity she will save herself from the last disgrace; and that, if she must fall, she will fall by no ignoble hand.
It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the queen of France, then the dauphiness, at Versailles, and surely never lighted on this orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. I saw her just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move in — glittering like the morning star, full of life and splendor and joy. Oh! what a revolution! and what a heart must I have to contemplate without emotion that elevation and that fall! Little did I dream when she added titles of veneration to those of enthusiastic, distant, respectful love, that she should ever be obliged to carry the sharp antidote against disgrace concealed in that bosom; little did I dream that I should have lived to see such disasters fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men, in a nation of men of honor and of cavaliers. I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened her with insult. But the age of chivalry is gone.
That of sophisters, economists; and calculators has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever. Never, never more shall we behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex, that proud submission, that dignified obedience, that subordination of the heart which kept alive, even in servitude itself, the spirit of an exalted freedom. The unbought grace of life, the cheap defense of nations, the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise, is gone! It is gone, that sensibility of principle, that chastity of honor which felt a stain like a wound, which inspired courage whilst it mitigated ferocity, which ennobled whatever it touched, and under which vice itself lost half its evil by losing all its grossness.
THIS mixed system of opinion and sentiment had its origin in the ancient chivalry; and the principle, though varied in its appearance by the varying state of human affairs, subsisted and influenced through a long succession of generations even to the time we live in. If it should ever be totally extinguished, the loss I fear will be great. It is this which has given its character to modern Europe. It is this which has distinguished it under all its forms of government, and distinguished it to its advantage, from the states of Asia and possibly from those states which flourished in the most brilliant periods of the antique world. It was this which, without confounding ranks, had produced a noble equality and handed it down through all the gradations of social life. It was this opinion which mitigated kings into companions and raised private men to be fellows with kings. Without force or opposition, it subdued the fierceness of pride and power, it obliged sovereigns to submit to the soft collar of social esteem, compelled stern authority to submit to elegance, and gave a domination, vanquisher of laws, to be subdued by manners.
But now all is to be changed. All the pleasing illusions which made power gentle and obedience liberal, which harmonized the different shades of life, and which, by a bland assimilation, incorporated into politics the sentiments which beautify and soften private society, are to be dissolved by this new conquering empire of light and reason. All the decent drapery of life is to be rudely torn off. All the super-added ideas, furnished from the wardrobe of a moral imagination, which the heart owns and the understanding ratifies as necessary to cover the defects of our naked, shivering nature, and to raise it to dignity in our own estimation, are to be exploded as a ridiculous, absurd, and antiquated fashion.
On this scheme of things, a king is but a man, a queen is but a woman; a woman is but an animal, and an animal not of the highest order. All homage paid to the sex in general as such, and without distinct views, is to be regarded as romance and folly. Regicide, and parricide, and sacrilege are but fictions of superstition, corrupting jurisprudence by destroying its simplicity. The murder of a king, or a queen, or a bishop, or a father are only common homicide; and if the people are by any chance or in any way gainers by it, a sort of homicide much the most pardonable, and into which we ought not to make too severe a scrutiny.
On the scheme of this barbarous philosophy, which is the offspring of cold hearts and muddy understandings, and which is as void of solid wisdom as it is destitute of all taste and elegance, laws are to be supported only by their own terrors and by the concern which each individual may find in them from his own private speculations or can spare to them from his own private interests. In the groves of their academy, at the end of every vista, you see nothing but the gallows. Nothing is left which engages the affections on the part of the commonwealth. On the principles of this mechanic philosophy, our institutions can never be embodied, if I may use the expression, in persons, so as to create in us love, veneration, admiration, or attachment. But that sort of reason which banishes the affections is incapable of filling their place. These public affections, combined with manners, are required sometimes as supplements, sometimes as correctives, always as aids to law. The precept given by a wise man, as well as a great critic, for the construction of poems is equally true as to states: — Non satis est pulchra esse poemata, dulcia sunto. There ought to be a system of manners in every nation which a well-informed mind would be disposed to relish. To make us love our country, our country ought to be lovely.
But power, of some kind or other, will survive the shock in which manners and opinions perish; and it will find other and worse means for its support. The usurpation which, in order to subvert ancient institutions, has destroyed ancient principles will hold power by arts similar to those by which it has acquired it. When the old feudal and chivalrous spirit of fealty, which, by freeing kings from fear, freed both kings and subjects from the precautions of tyranny, shall be extinct in the minds of men, plots and assassinations will be anticipated by preventive murder and preventive confiscation, and that long roll of grim and bloody maxims which form the political code of all power not standing on its own honor and the honor of those who are to obey it.
Kings will be tyrants from policy when subjects are rebels from principle.
When ancient opinions and rules of life are taken away, the loss cannot possibly be estimated. From that moment we have no compass to govern us; nor can we know distinctly to what port we steer. Europe, undoubtedly, taken in a mass, was in a flourishing condition the day on which your revolution was completed. How much of that prosperous state was owing to the spirit of our old manners and opinions is not easy to say; but as such causes cannot be indifferent in their operation, we must presume that on the whole their operation was beneficial.
We are but too apt to consider things in the state in which we find them, without sufficiently adverting to the causes by which they have been produced and possibly may be upheld. Nothing is more certain than that our manners, our civilization, and all the good things which are connected with manners and with civilization have, in this European world of ours, depended for ages upon two principles and were, indeed, the result of both combined: I mean the spirit of a gentleman and the spirit of religion. The nobility and the clergy, the one by profession, the other by patronage, kept learning in existence, even in the midst of arms and confusions, and whilst governments were rather in their causes than formed. Learning paid back what it received to nobility and to priesthood, and paid it with usury, by enlarging their ideas and by furnishing their minds. Happy if they had all continued to know their indissoluble union and their proper place! Happy if learning, not debauched by ambition, had been satisfied to continue the instructor, and not aspired to be the master! Along with its natural protectors and guardians, learning will be cast into the mire and trodden down under the hoofs of a swinish multitude.
If, as I suspect, modern letters owe more than they are always willing to own to ancient manners, so do other interests which we value full as much as they are worth. Even commerce and trade and manufacture, the gods of our economical politicians, are themselves perhaps but creatures, are themselves but effects which, as first causes, we choose to worship. They certainly grew under the same shade in which learning flourished. They, too, may decay with their natural protecting principles. With you, for the present at least, they all threaten to disappear together. Where trade and manufactures are wanting to a people, and the spirit of nobility and religion remains, sentiment supplies, and not always ill supplies, their place; but if commerce and the arts should be lost in an experiment to try how well a state may stand without these old fundamental principles, what sort of a thing must be a nation of gross, stupid, ferocious, and, at the same time, poor and sordid barbarians, destitute of religion, honor, or manly pride, possessing nothing at present, and hoping for nothing hereafter?
I wish you may not be going fast, and by the shortest cut, to that horrible and disgustful situation. Already there appears a poverty of conception, a coarseness, and a vulgarity in all the proceedings of the Assembly and of all their instructors. Their liberty is not liberal. Their science is presumptuous ignorance. Their humanity is savage and brutal.
It is not clear whether in England we learned those grand and decorous principles and manners, of which considerable traces yet remain, from you or whether you took them from us. But to you, I think, we trace them best. You seem to me to be gentis incunabula nostrae. France has always more or less influenced manners in England; and when your fountain is choked up and polluted, the stream will not run long, or not run clear, with us or perhaps with any nation. This gives all Europe, in my opinion, but too close and connected a concern in what is done in France. Excuse me, therefore, if I have dwelt too long on the atrocious spectacle of the 6th of October, 1789, or have given too much scope to the reflections which have arisen in my mind on occasion of the most important of all revolutions, which may be dated from that day — I mean a revolution in sentiments, manners, and moral opinions. As things now stand, with everything respectable destroyed without us, and an attempt to destroy within us every principle of respect, one is almost forced to apologize for harboring the common feelings of men.
WHY do I feel so differently from the Reverend Dr. Price and those of his lay flock who will choose to adopt the sentiments of his discourse? — For this plain reason: because it is natural I should; because we are so made as to be affected at such spectacles with melancholy sentiments upon the unstable condition of mortal prosperity and the tremendous uncertainty of human greatness; because in those natural feelings we learn great lessons; because in events like these our passions instruct our reason; because when kings are hurled from their thrones by the Supreme Director of this great drama and become the objects of insult to the base and of pity to the good, we behold such disasters in the moral as we should behold a miracle in the physical order of things. We are alarmed into reflection; our minds (as it has long since been observed) are purified by terror and pity, our weak, unthinking pride is humbled under the dispensations of a mysterious wisdom. Some tears might be drawn from me if such a spectacle were exhibited on the stage. I should be truly ashamed of finding in myself that superficial, theatric sense of painted distress whilst I could exult over it in real life. With such a perverted mind I could never venture to show my face at a tragedy. People would think the tears that Garrick formerly, or that Siddons not long since, have extorted from me were the tears of hypocrisy; I should know them to be the tears of folly.
Indeed, the theatre is a better school of moral sentiments than churches, where the feelings of humanity are thus outraged. Poets who have to deal with an audience not yet graduated in the school of the rights of men and who must apply themselves to the moral constitution of the heart would not dare to produce such a triumph as a matter of exultation. There, where men follow their natural impulses, they would not bear the odious maxims of a Machiavellian policy, whether applied to the attainments of monarchical or democratic tyranny. They would reject them on the modern as they once did on the ancient stage, where they could not bear even the hypothetical proposition of such wickedness in the mouth of a personated tyrant, though suitable to the character he sustained. No theatric audience in Athens would bear what has been borne in the midst of the real tragedy of this triumphal day: a principal actor weighing, as it were, in scales hung in a shop of horrors, so much actual crime against so much contingent advantage; and after putting in and out weights, declaring that the balance was on the side of the advantages. They would not bear to see the crimes of new democracy posted as in a ledger against the crimes of old despotism, and the book-keepers of politics finding democracy still in debt, but by no means unable or unwilling to pay the balance. In the theater, the first intuitive glance, without any elaborate process of reasoning, will show that this method of political computation would justify every extent of crime. They would see that on these principles, even where the very worst acts were not perpetrated, it was owing rather to the fortune of the conspirators than to their parsimony in the expenditure of treachery and blood. They would soon see that criminal means once tolerated are soon preferred. They present a shorter cut to the object than through the highway of the moral virtues. Justifying perfidy and murder for public benefit, public benefit would soon become the pretext, and perfidy and murder the end, until rapacity, malice, revenge, and fear more dreadful than revenge could satiate their insatiable appetites. Such must be the consequences of losing, in the splendor of these triumphs of the rights of men, all natural sense of wrong and right.
But the reverend pastor exults in this ""leading in triumph"", because truly Louis the Sixteenth was ""an arbitrary monarch""; that is, in other words, neither more nor less than because he was Louis the Sixteenth, and because he had the misfortune to be born king of France, with the prerogatives of which a long line of ancestors and a long acquiescence of the people, without any act of his, had put him in possession. A misfortune it has indeed turned out to him that he was born king of France. But misfortune is not crime, nor is indiscretion always the greatest guilt. I shall never think that a prince the acts of whose whole reign was a series of concessions to his subjects, who was willing to relax his authority, to remit his prerogatives, to call his people to a share of freedom not known, perhaps not desired, by their ancestors — such a prince, though he should be subjected to the common frailties attached to men and to princes, though he should have once thought it necessary to provide force against the desperate designs manifestly carrying on against his person and the remnants of his authority — though all this should be taken into consideration, I shall be led with great difficulty to think he deserves the cruel and insulting triumph of Paris and of Dr. Price. I tremble for the cause of liberty from such an example to kings. I tremble for the cause of humanity in the unpunished outrages of the most wicked of mankind. But there are some people of that low and degenerate fashion of mind, that they look up with a sort of complacent awe and admiration to kings who know to keep firm in their seat, to hold a strict hand over their subjects, to assert their prerogative, and, by the awakened vigilance of a severe despotism, to guard against the very first approaches to freedom. Against such as these they never elevate their voice. Deserters from principle, listed with fortune, they never see any good in suffering virtue, nor any crime in prosperous usurpation.
If it could have been made clear to me that the king and queen of France (those I mean who were such before the triumph) were inexorable and cruel tyrants, that they had formed a deliberate scheme for massacring the National Assembly (I think I have seen something like the latter insinuated in certain publications), I should think their captivity just. If this be true, much more ought to have been done, but done, in my opinion, in another manner. The punishment of real tyrants is a noble and awful act of justice; and it has with truth been said to be consolatory to the human mind. But if I were to punish a wicked king, I should regard the dignity in avenging the crime. Justice is grave and decorous, and in its punishments rather seems to submit to a necessity than to make a choice. Had Nero, or Agrippina, or Louis the Eleventh, or Charles the Ninth been the subject; if Charles the Twelfth of Sweden, after the murder of Patkul, or his predecessor Christina, after the murder of Monaldeschi, had fallen into your hands, Sir, or into mine, I am sure our conduct would have been different.
If the French king, or king of the French (or by whatever name he is known in the new vocabulary of your constitution), has in his own person and that of his queen really deserved these unavowed, but unavenged, murderous attempts and those frequent indignities more cruel than murder, such a person would ill deserve even that subordinate executory trust which I understand is to be placed in him, nor is he fit to be called chief in a nation which he has outraged and oppressed. A worse choice for such an office in a new commonwealth than that of a deposed tyrant could not possibly be made. But to degrade and insult a man as the worst of criminals and afterwards to trust him in your highest concerns as a faithful, honest, and zealous servant is not consistent to reasoning, nor prudent in policy, nor safe in practice. Those who could make such an appointment must be guilty of a more flagrant breach of trust than any they have yet committed against the people. As this is the only crime in which your leading politicians could have acted inconsistently, I conclude that there is no sort of ground for these horrid insinuations. I think no better of all the other calumnies.
IN ENGLAND, we give no credit to them. We are generous enemies; we are faithful allies. We spurn from us with disgust and indignation the slanders of those who bring us their anecdotes with the attestation of the flower-de-luce on their shoulder. We have Lord George Gordon fast in Newgate; and neither his being a public proselyte to Judaism, nor his having, in his zeal against Catholic priests and all sorts of ecclesiastics, raised a mob (excuse the term, it is still in use here) which pulled down all our prisons, have preserved to him a liberty of which he did not render himself worthy by a virtuous use of it. We have rebuilt Newgate and tenanted the mansion. We have prisons almost as strong as the Bastille for those who dare to libel the queens of France. In this spiritual retreat, let the noble libeller remain. Let him there meditate on his Talmud until he learns a conduct more becoming his birth and parts, and not so disgraceful to the ancient religion to which he has become a proselyte; or until some persons from your side of the water, to please your new Hebrew brethren, shall ransom him. He may then be enabled to purchase with the old boards of the synagogue and a very small poundage on the long compound interest of the thirty pieces of silver (Dr. Price has shown us what miracles compound interest will perform in 1790 years,), the lands which are lately discovered to have been usurped by the Gallican church. Send us your Popish archbishop of Paris, and we will send you our Protestant Rabbin. We shall treat the person you send us in exchange like a gentleman and an honest man, as he is; but pray let him bring with him the fund of his hospitality, bounty, and charity, and, depend upon it, we shall never confiscate a shilling of that honorable and pious fund, nor think of enriching the treasury with the spoils of the poor-box.
To tell you the truth, my dear Sir, I think the honor of our nation to be somewhat concerned in the disclaimer of the proceedings of this society of the Old Jewry and the London Tavern. I have no man's proxy. I speak only for myself when I disclaim, as I do with all possible earnestness, all communion with the actors in that triumph or with the admirers of it. When I assert anything else as concerning the people of England, I speak from observation, not from authority, but I speak from the experience I have had in a pretty extensive and mixed communication with the inhabitants of this kingdom, of all descriptions and ranks, and after a course of attentive observations begun early in life and continued for nearly forty years. I have often been astonished, considering that we are divided from you but by a slender dyke of about twenty-four miles, and that the mutual intercourse between the two countries has lately been very great, to find how little you seem to know of us. I suspect that this is owing to your forming a judgment of this nation from certain publications which do very erroneously, if they do at all, represent the opinions and dispositions generally prevalent in England. The vanity, restlessness, petulance, and spirit of intrigue, of several petty cabals, who attempt to hide their total want of consequence in bustle and noise, and puffing, and mutual quotation of each other, makes you imagine that our contemptuous neglect of their abilities is a mark of general acquiescence in their opinions. No such thing, I assure you. Because half a dozen grasshoppers under a fern make the field ring with their importunate chink, whilst thousands of great cattle, reposed beneath the shadow of the British oak, chew the cud and are silent, pray do not imagine that those who make the noise are the only inhabitants of the field; that, of course, they are many in number, or that, after all, they are other than the little, shrivelled, meager, hopping, though loud and troublesome, insects of the hour.
I almost venture to affirm that not one in a hundred amongst us participates in the ""triumph"" of the Revolution Society. If the king and queen of France, and their children, were to fall into our hands by the chance of war, in the most acrimonious of all hostilities (I deprecate such an event, I deprecate such hostility), they would be treated with another sort of triumphal entry into London. We formerly have had a king of France in that situation; you have read how he was treated by the victor in the field, and in what manner he was afterwards received in England. Four hundred years have gone over us, but I believe we are not materially changed since that period. Thanks to our sullen resistance to innovation, thanks to the cold sluggishness of our national character, we still bear the stamp of our forefathers. We have not (as I conceive) lost the generosity and dignity of thinking of the fourteenth century, nor as yet have we subtilized ourselves into savages. We are not the converts of Rousseau; we are not the disciples of Voltaire; Helvetius has made no progress amongst us. Atheists are not our preachers; madmen are not our lawgivers. We know that we have made no discoveries, and we think that no discoveries are to be made in morality, nor many in the great principles of government, nor in the ideas of liberty, which were understood long before we were born, altogether as well as they will be after the grace has heaped its mold upon our presumption and the silent tomb shall have imposed its law on our pert loquacity. In England we have not yet been completely embowelled of our natural entrails; we still feel within us, and we cherish and cultivate, those inbred sentiments which are the faithful guardians, the active monitors of our duty, the true supporters of all liberal and manly morals. We have not been drawn and trussed, in order that we may be filled, like stuffed birds in a museum, with chaff and rags and paltry blurred shreds of paper about the rights of men. We preserve the whole of our feelings still native and entire, unsophisticated by pedantry and infidelity. We have real hearts of flesh and blood beating in our bosoms. We fear God; we look up with awe to kings, with affection to parliaments, with duty to magistrates, with reverence to priests, and with respect to nobility. Why? Because when such ideas are brought before our minds, it is natural to be so affected; because all other feelings are false and spurious and tend to corrupt our minds, to vitiate our primary morals, to render us unfit for rational liberty, and, by teaching us a servile, licentious, and abandoned insolence, to be our low sport for a few holidays, to make us perfectly fit for, and justly deserving of, slavery through the whole course of our lives.
YOU see, Sir, that in this enlightened age I am bold enough to confess that we are generally men of untaught feelings, that, instead of casting away all our old prejudices, we cherish them to a very considerable degree, and, to take more shame to ourselves, we cherish them because they are prejudices; and the longer they have lasted and the more generally they have prevailed, the more we cherish them. We are afraid to put men to live and trade each on his own private stock of reason, because we suspect that this stock in each man is small, and that the individuals would do better to avail themselves of the general bank and capital of nations and of ages. Many of our men of speculation, instead of exploding general prejudices, employ their sagacity to discover the latent wisdom which prevails in them. If they find what they seek, and they seldom fail, they think it more wise to continue the prejudice, with the reason involved, than to cast away the coat of prejudice and to leave nothing but the naked reason; because prejudice, with its reason, has a motive to give action to that reason, and an affection which will give it permanence. Prejudice is of ready application in the emergency; it previously engages the mind in a steady course of wisdom and virtue and does not leave the man hesitating in the moment of decision skeptical, puzzled, and unresolved. Prejudice renders a man's virtue his habit, and not a series of unconnected acts. Through just prejudice, his duty becomes a part of his nature.
Your literary men and your politicians, and so do the whole clan of the enlightened among us, essentially differ in these points. They have no respect for the wisdom of others, but they pay it off by a very full measure of confidence in their own. With them it is a sufficient motive to destroy an old scheme of things because it is an old one. As to the new, they are in no sort of fear with regard to the duration of a building run up in haste, because duration is no object to those who think little or nothing has been done before their time, and who place all their hopes in discovery. They conceive, very systematically, that all things which give perpetuity are mischievous, and therefore they are at inexpiable war with all establishments. They think that government may vary like modes of dress, and with as little ill effect; that there needs no principle of attachment, except a sense of present convenience, to any constitution of the state. They always speak as if they were of opinion that there is a singular species of compact between them and their magistrates which binds the magistrate, but which has nothing reciprocal in it, but that the majesty of the people has a right to dissolve it without any reason but its will. Their attachment to their country itself is only so far as it agrees with some of their fleeting projects; it begins and ends with that scheme of polity which falls in with their momentary opinion.
These doctrines, or rather sentiments, seem prevalent with your new statesmen. But they are wholly different from those on which we have always acted in this country.
I hear it is sometimes given out in France that what is doing among you is after the example of England. I beg leave to affirm that scarcely anything done with you has originated from the practice or the prevalent opinions of this people, either in the act or in the spirit of the proceeding. Let me add that we are as unwilling to learn these lessons from France as we are sure that we never taught them to that nation. The cabals here who take a sort of share of your transactions as yet consist of but a handful of people. If, unfortunately, by their intrigues, their sermons, their publications, and by a confidence derived from an expected union with the counsels and forces of the French nation, they should draw considerable numbers into their faction, and in consequence should seriously attempt anything here in imitation of what has been done with you, the event, I dare venture to prophesy, will be that, with some trouble to their country, they will soon accomplish their own destruction. This people refused to change their law in remote ages from respect to the infallibility of popes, and they will not now alter it from a pious implicit faith in the dogmatism of philosophers, though the former was armed with the anathema and crusade, and though the latter should act with the libel and the lamp-iron.
Formerly, your affairs were your own concern only. We felt for them as men, but we kept aloof from them because we were not citizens of France. But when we see the model held up to ourselves, we must feel as Englishmen, and feeling, we must provide as Englishmen. Your affairs, in spite of us, are made a part of our interest, so far at least as to keep at a distance your panacea, or your plague. If it be a panacea, we do not want it. We know the consequences of unnecessary physic. If it be a plague, it is such a plague that the precautions of the most severe quarantine ought to be established against it.
I hear on all hands that a cabal calling itself philosophic receives the glory of many of the late proceedings, and that their opinions and systems are the true actuating spirit of the whole of them. I have heard of no party in England, literary or political, at any time, known by such a description. It is not with you composed of those men, is it, whom the vulgar in their blunt, homely style commonly call atheists and infidels? If it be, I admit that we, too, have had writers of that description who made some noise in their day. At present they repose in lasting oblivion. Who, born within the last forty years, has read one word of Collins, and Toland, and Tindal, and Chubb, and Morgan, and that whole race who called themselves Freethinkers? Who now reads Bolingbroke? Who ever read him through? Ask the booksellers of London what is become of all these lights of the world. In as few years their few successors will go to the family vault of ""all the Capulets"". But whatever they were, or are, with us, they were and are wholly unconnected individuals. With us they kept the common nature of their kind and were not gregarious. They never acted in corps or were known as a faction in the state, nor presumed to influence in that name or character, or for the purposes of such a faction, on any of our public concerns. Whether they ought so to exist and so be permitted to act is another question. As such cabals have not existed in England, so neither has the spirit of them had any influence in establishing the original frame of our constitution or in any one of the several reparations and improvements it has undergone. The whole has been done under the auspices, and is confirmed by the sanctions, of religion and piety. The whole has emanated from the simplicity of our national character and from a sort of native plainness and directness of understanding, which for a long time characterized those men who have successively obtained authority amongst us. This disposition still remains, at least in the great body of the people.
WE KNOW, AND WHAT IS BETTER, we feel inwardly, that religion is the basis of civil society and the source of all good and of all comfort. In England we are so convinced of this, that there is no rust of superstition with which the accumulated absurdity of the human mind might have crusted it over in the course of ages, that ninety-nine in a hundred of the people of England would not prefer to impiety. We shall never be such fools as to call in an enemy to the substance of any system to remove its corruptions, to supply its defects, or to perfect its construction. If our religious tenets should ever want a further elucidation, we shall not call on atheism to explain them. We shall not light up our temple from that unhallowed fire. It will be illuminated with other lights. It will be perfumed with other incense than the infectious stuff which is imported by the smugglers of adulterated metaphysics. If our ecclesiastical establishment should want a revision, it is not avarice or rapacity, public or private, that we shall employ for the audit, or receipt, or application of its consecrated revenue. Violently condemning neither the Greek nor the Armenian, nor, since heats are subsided, the Roman system of religion, we prefer the Protestant, not because we think it has less of the Christian religion in it, but because, in our judgment, it has more. We are Protestants, not from indifference, but from zeal.
We know, and it is our pride to know, that man is by his constitution a religious animal; that atheism is against, not only our reason, but our instincts; and that it cannot prevail long. But if, in the moment of riot and in a drunken delirium from the hot spirit drawn out of the alembic of hell, which in France is now so furiously boiling, we should uncover our nakedness by throwing off that Christian religion which has hitherto been our boast and comfort, and one great source of civilization amongst us and amongst many other nations, we are apprehensive (being well aware that the mind will not endure a void) that some uncouth, pernicious, and degrading superstition might take place of it.
For that reason, before we take from our establishment the natural, human means of estimation and give it up to contempt, as you have done, and in doing it have incurred the penalties you well deserve to suffer, we desire that some other may be presented to us in the place of it. We shall then form our judgment.
On these ideas, instead of quarrelling with establishments, as some do who have made a philosophy and a religion of their hostility to such institutions, we cleave closely to them. We are resolved to keep an established church, an established monarchy, an established aristocracy, and an established democracy, each in the degree it exists, and in no greater. I shall show you presently how much of each of these we possess.
It has been the misfortune (not, as these gentlemen think it, the glory) of this age that everything is to be discussed as if the constitution of our country were to be always a subject rather of altercation than enjoyment. For this reason, as well as for the satisfaction of those among you (if any such you have among you) who may wish to profit of examples, I venture to trouble you with a few thoughts upon each of these establishments. I do not think they were unwise in ancient Rome who, when they wished to new-model their laws, set commissioners to examine the best constituted republics within their reach.
First, I beg leave to speak of our church establishment, which is the first of our prejudices, not a prejudice destitute of reason, but involving in it profound and extensive wisdom. I speak of it first. It is first and last and midst in our minds. For, taking ground on that religious system of which we are now in possession, we continue to act on the early received and uniformly continued sense of mankind. That sense not only, like a wise architect, hath built up the august fabric of states, but, like a provident proprietor, to preserve the structure from profanation and ruin, as a sacred temple purged from all the impurities of fraud and violence and injustice and tyranny, hath solemnly and forever consecrated the commonwealth and all that officiate in it. This consecration is made that all who administer the government of men, in which they stand in the person of God himself, should have high and worthy notions of their function and destination, that their hope should be full of immortality, that they should not look to the paltry pelf of the moment nor to the temporary and transient praise of the vulgar, but to a solid, permanent existence in the permanent part of their nature, and to a permanent fame and glory in the example they leave as a rich inheritance to the world.
Such sublime principles ought to be infused into persons of exalted situations, and religious establishments provided that may continually revive and enforce them. Every sort of moral, every sort of civil, every sort of politic institution, aiding the rational and natural ties that connect the human understanding and affections to the divine, are not more than necessary in order to build up that wonderful structure Man, whose prerogative it is to be in a great degree a creature of his own making, and who, when made as he ought to be made, is destined to hold no trivial place in the creation. But whenever man is put over men, as the better nature ought ever to preside, in that case more particularly, he should as nearly as possible be approximated to his perfection.
The consecration of the state by a state religious establishment is necessary, also, to operate with a wholesome awe upon free citizens, because, in order to secure their freedom, they must enjoy some determinate portion of power. To them, therefore, a religion connected with the state, and with their duty toward it, becomes even more necessary than in such societies where the people, by the terms of their subjection, are confined to private sentiments and the management of their own family concerns. All persons possessing any portion of power ought to be strongly and awfully impressed with an idea that they act in trust, and that they are to account for their conduct in that trust to the one great Master, Author, and Founder of society.
This principle ought even to be more strongly impressed upon the minds of those who compose the collective sovereignty than upon those of single princes. Without instruments, these princes can do nothing. Whoever uses instruments, in finding helps, finds also impediments. Their power is, therefore, by no means complete, nor are they safe in extreme abuse. Such persons, however elevated by flattery, arrogance, and self-opinion, must be sensible that, whether covered or not by positive law, in some way or other they are accountable even here for the abuse of their trust. If they are not cut off by a rebellion of their people, they may be strangled by the very janissaries kept for their security against all other rebellion. Thus we have seen the king of France sold by his soldiers for an increase of pay. But where popular authority is absolute and unrestrained, the people have an infinitely greater, because a far better founded, confidence in their own power. They are themselves, in a great measure, their own instruments. They are nearer to their objects. Besides, they are less under responsibility to one of the greatest controlling powers on the earth, the sense of fame and estimation. The share of infamy that is likely to fall to the lot of each individual in public acts is small indeed, the operation of opinion being in the inverse ratio to the number of those who abuse power. Their own approbation of their own acts has to them the appearance of a public judgment in their favor. A perfect democracy is, therefore, the most shameless thing in the world. As it is the most shameless, it is also the most fearless. No man apprehends in his person that he can be made subject to punishment. Certainly the people at large never ought, for as all punishments are for example toward the conservation of the people at large, the people at large can never become the subject of punishment by any human hand. It is therefore of infinite importance that they should not be suffered to imagine that their will, any more than that of kings, is the standard of right and wrong. They ought to be persuaded that they are full as little entitled, and far less qualified with safety to themselves, to use any arbitrary power whatsoever; that therefore they are not, under a false show of liberty, but in truth to exercise an unnatural, inverted domination, tyrannically to exact from those who officiate in the state not an entire devotion to their interest, which is their right, but an abject submission to their occasional will, extinguishing thereby in all those who serve them all moral principle, all sense of dignity, all use of judgment, and all consistency of character; whilst by the very same process they give themselves up a proper, a suitable, but a most contemptible prey to the servile ambition of popular sycophants or courtly flatterers.
When the people have emptied themselves of all the lust of selfish will, which without religion it is utterly impossible they ever should, when they are conscious that they exercise, and exercise perhaps in a higher link of the order of delegation, the power, which to be legitimate must be according to that eternal, immutable law in which will and reason are the same, they will be more careful how they place power in base and incapable hands. In their nomination to office, they will not appoint to the exercise of authority as to a pitiful job, but as to a holy function, not according to their sordid, selfish interest, nor to their wanton caprice, nor to their arbitrary will, but they will confer that power (which any man may well tremble to give or to receive) on those only in whom they may discern that predominant proportion of active virtue and wisdom, taken together and fitted to the charge, such as in the great and inevitable mixed mass of human imperfections and infirmities is to be found.
When they are habitually convinced that no evil can be acceptable, either in the act or the permission, to him whose essence is good, they will be better able to extirpate out of the minds of all magistrates, civil, ecclesiastical, or military, anything that bears the least resemblance to a proud and lawless domination.
But one of the first and most leading principles on which the commonwealth and the laws are consecrated is, lest the temporary possessors and life-renters in it, unmindful of what they have received from their ancestors or of what is due to their posterity, should act as if they were the entire masters, that they should not think it among their rights to cut off the entail or commit waste on the inheritance by destroying at their pleasure the whole original fabric of their society, hazarding to leave to those who come after them a ruin instead of an habitation — and teaching these successors as little to respect their contrivances as they had themselves respected the institutions of their forefathers. By this unprincipled facility of changing the state as often, and as much, and in as many ways as there are floating fancies or fashions, the whole chain and continuity of the commonwealth would be broken. No one generation could link with the other. Men would become little better than the flies of a summer.
And first of all, the science of jurisprudence, the pride of the human intellect, which with all its defects, redundancies, and errors is the collected reason of ages, combining the principles of original justice with the infinite variety of human concerns, as a heap of old exploded errors, would be no longer studied. Personal self-sufficiency and arrogance (the certain attendants upon all those who have never experienced a wisdom greater than their own) would usurp the tribunal. Of course, no certain laws, establishing invariable grounds of hope and fear, would keep the actions of men in a certain course or direct them to a certain end. Nothing stable in the modes of holding property or exercising function could form a solid ground on which any parent could speculate in the education of his offspring or in a choice for their future establishment in the world. No principles would be early worked into the habits. As soon as the most able instructor had completed his laborious course of institution, instead of sending forth his pupil, accomplished in a virtuous discipline, fitted to procure him attention and respect in his place in society, he would find everything altered, and that he had turned out a poor creature to the contempt and derision of the world, ignorant of the true grounds of estimation. Who would insure a tender and delicate sense of honor to beat almost with the first pulses of the heart when no man could know what would be the test of honor in a nation continually varying the standard of its coin? No part of life would retain its acquisitions. Barbarism with regard to science and literature, unskilfulness with regard to arts and manufactures, would infallibly succeed to the want of a steady education and settled principle; and thus the commonwealth itself would, in a few generations, crumble away, be disconnected into the dust and powder of individuality, and at length dispersed to all the winds of heaven.
To avoid, therefore, the evils of inconstancy and versatility, ten thousand times worse than those of obstinacy and the blindest prejudice, we have consecrated the state, that no man should approach to look into its defects or corruptions but with due caution, that he should never dream of beginning its reformation by its subversion, that he should approach to the faults of the state as to the wounds of a father, with pious awe and trembling solicitude. By this wise prejudice we are taught to look with horror on those children of their country who are prompt rashly to hack that aged parent in pieces and put him into the kettle of magicians, in hopes that by their poisonous weeds and wild incantations they may regenerate the paternal constitution and renovate their father's life.
SOCIETY is indeed a contract. Subordinate contracts for objects of mere occasional interest may be dissolved at pleasure — but the state ought not to be considered as nothing better than a partnership agreement in a trade of pepper and coffee, calico, or tobacco, or some other such low concern, to be taken up for a little temporary interest, and to be dissolved by the fancy of the parties. It is to be looked on with other reverence, because it is not a partnership in things subservient only to the gross animal existence of a temporary and perishable nature. It is a partnership in all science; a partnership in all art; a partnership in every virtue and in all perfection. As the ends of such a partnership cannot be obtained in many generations, it becomes a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born. Each contract of each particular state is but a clause in the great primeval contract of eternal society, linking the lower with the higher natures, connecting the visible and invisible world, according to a fixed compact sanctioned by the inviolable oath which holds all physical and all moral natures, each in their appointed place. This law is not subject to the will of those who by an obligation above them, and infinitely superior, are bound to submit their will to that law. The municipal corporations of that universal kingdom are not morally at liberty at their pleasure, and on their speculations of a contingent improvement, wholly to separate and tear asunder the bands of their subordinate community and to dissolve it into an unsocial, uncivil, unconnected chaos of elementary principles. It is the first and supreme necessity only, a necessity that is not chosen but chooses, a necessity paramount to deliberation, that admits no discussion and demands no evidence, which alone can justify a resort to anarchy. This necessity is no exception to the rule, because this necessity itself is a part, too, of that moral and physical disposition of things to which man must be obedient by consent or force; but if that which is only submission to necessity should be made the object of choice, the law is broken, nature is disobeyed, and the rebellious are outlawed, cast forth, and exiled from this world of reason, and order, and peace, and virtue, and fruitful penitence, into the antagonist world of madness, discord, vice, confusion, and unavailing sorrow.
These, my dear Sir, are, were, and, I think, long will be the sentiments of not the least learned and reflecting part of this kingdom. They who are included in this description form their opinions on such grounds as such persons ought to form them. The less inquiring receive them from an authority which those whom Providence dooms to live on trust need not be ashamed to rely on. These two sorts of men move in the same direction, though in a different place. They both move with the order of the universe.
They all know or feel this great ancient truth: Quod illi principi et praepotenti Deo qui omnem hunc mundum regit, nihil eorum quae quidem fiant in terris acceptius quam concilia et coetus hominum jure sociati quae civitates appellantur. They take this tenet of the head and heart, not from the great name which it immediately bears, nor from the greater from whence it is derived, but from that which alone can give true weight and sanction to any learned opinion, the common nature and common relation of men. Persuaded that all things ought to be done with reference, and referring all to the point of reference to which all should be directed, they think themselves bound, not only as individuals in the sanctuary of the heart or as congregated in that personal capacity, to renew the memory of their high origin and cast, but also in their corporate character to perform their national homage to the institutor and author and protector of civil society; without which civil society man could not by any possibility arrive at the perfection of which his nature is capable, nor even make a remote and faint approach to it. They conceive that He who gave our nature to be perfected by our virtue willed also the necessary means of its perfection. He willed therefore the state — He willed its connection with the source and original archetype of all perfection. They who are convinced of this His will, which is the law of laws and the sovereign of sovereigns, cannot think it reprehensible that this our corporate fealty and homage, that this our recognition of a seigniory paramount, I had almost said this oblation of the state itself as a worthy offering on the high altar of universal praise, should be performed as all public, solemn acts are performed, in buildings, in music, in decoration, in speech, in the dignity of persons, according to the customs of mankind taught by their nature; that is, with modest splendor and unassuming state, with mild majesty and sober pomp. For those purposes they think some part of the wealth of the country is as usefully employed as it can be in fomenting the luxury of individuals. It is the public ornament. It is the public consolation. It nourishes the public hope. The poorest man finds his own importance and dignity in it, whilst the wealth and pride of individuals at every moment makes the man of humble rank and fortune sensible of his inferiority and degrades and vilifies his condition. It is for the man in humble life, and to raise his nature and to put him in mind of a state in which the privileges of opulence will cease, when he will be equal by nature, and may be more than equal by virtue, that this portion of the general wealth of his country is employed and sanctified.
I assure you I do not aim at singularity. I give you opinions which have been accepted amongst us, from very early times to this moment, with a continued and general approbation, and which indeed are worked into my mind that I am unable to distinguish what I have learned from others from the results of my own meditation.
It is on some such principles that the majority of the people of England, far from thinking a religious national establishment unlawful, hardly think it lawful to be without one. In France you are wholly mistaken if you do not believe us above all other things attached to it, and beyond all other nations; and when this people has acted unwisely and unjustifiably in its favor (as in some instances they have done most certainly), in their very errors you will at least discover their zeal.
This principle runs through the whole system of their polity. They do not consider their church establishment as convenient, but as essential to their state, not as a thing heterogeneous and separable, something added for accommodation, what they may either keep or lay aside according to their temporary ideas of convenience. They consider it as the foundation of their whole constitution, with which, and with every part of which, it holds an indissoluble union. Church and state are ideas inseparable in their minds, and scarcely is the one ever mentioned without mentioning the other.
Our education is so formed as to confirm and fix this impression. Our education is in a manner wholly in the hands of ecclesiastics, and in all stages from infancy to manhood. Even when our youth, leaving schools and universities, enter that most important period of life which begins to link experience and study together, and when with that view they visit other countries, instead of old domestics whom we have seen as governors to principal men from other parts, three-fourths of those who go abroad with our young nobility and gentlemen are ecclesiastics, not as austere masters, nor as mere followers, but as friends and companions of a graver character, and not seldom persons as well-born as themselves. With them, as relations, they most constantly keep a close connection through life. By this connection we conceive that we attach our gentlemen to the church, and we liberalize the church by an intercourse with the leading characters of the country.
So tenacious are we of the old ecclesiastical modes and fashions of institution that very little alteration has been made in them since the fourteenth or fifteenth century; adhering in this particular, as in all things else, to our old settled maxim, never entirely nor at once to depart from antiquity. We found these old institutions, on the whole, favorable to morality and discipline, and we thought they were susceptible of amendment without altering the ground. We thought that they were capable of receiving and meliorating, and above all of preserving, the accessions of science and literature, as the order of Providence should successively produce them. And after all, with this Gothic and monkish education (for such it is in the groundwork) we may put in our claim to as ample and as early a share in all the improvements in science, in arts, and in literature which have illuminated and adorned the modern world, as any other nation in Europe. We think one main cause of this improvement was our not despising the patrimony of knowledge which was left us by our forefathers.
It is from our attachment to a church establishment that the English nation did not think it wise to entrust that great, fundamental interest of the whole to what they trust no part of their civil or military public service, that is, to the unsteady and precarious contribution of individuals. They go further. They certainly never have suffered, and never will suffer, the fixed estate of the church to be converted into a pension, to depend on the treasury and to be delayed, withheld, or perhaps to be extinguished by fiscal difficulties, which difficulties may sometimes be pretended for political purposes, and are in fact often brought on by the extravagance, negligence, and rapacity of politicians. The people of England think that they have constitutional motives, as well as religious, against any project of turning their independent clergy into ecclesiastical pensioners of state. They tremble for their liberty, from the influence of a clergy dependent on the crown; they tremble for the public tranquillity from the disorders of a factious clergy, if it were made to depend upon any other than the crown. They therefore made their church, like their king and their nobility, independent.
From the united considerations of religion and constitutional policy, from their opinion of a duty to make sure provision for the consolation of the feeble and the instruction of the ignorant, they have incorporated and identified the estate of the church with the mass of private property, of which the state is not the proprietor, either for use or dominion, but the guardian only and the regulator. They have ordained that the provision of this establishment might be as stable as the earth on which it stands, and should not fluctuate with the Euripus of funds and actions.
The men of England, the men, I mean, of light and leading in England, whose wisdom (if they have any) is open and direct, would be ashamed, as of a silly deceitful trick, to profess any religion in name which, by their proceedings, they appear to contemn.
If by their conduct (the only language that rarely lies) they seemed to regard the great ruling principle of the moral and the natural world as a mere invention to keep the vulgar in obedience, they apprehend that by such a conduct they would defeat the politic purpose they have in view. They would find it difficult to make others believe in a system to which they manifestly give no credit themselves. The Christian statesmen of this land would indeed first provide for the multitude, because it is the multitude, and is therefore, as such, the first object in the ecclesiastical institution, and in all institutions. They have been taught that the circumstance of the gospel's being preached to the poor was one of the great tests of its true mission. They think, therefore, that those do not believe it who do not take care it should be preached to the poor. But as they know that charity is not confined to any one description, but ought to apply itself to all men who have wants, they are not deprived of a due and anxious sensation of pity to the distresses of the miserable great. They are not repelled through a fastidious delicacy, at the stench of their arrogance and presumption, from a medicinal attention to their mental blotches and running sores. They are sensible that religious instruction is of more consequence to them than to any others — from the greatness of the temptation to which they are exposed; from the important consequences that attend their faults; from the contagion of their ill example; from the necessity of bowing down the stubborn neck of their pride and ambition to the yoke of moderation and virtue; from a consideration of the fat stupidity and gross ignorance concerning what imports men most to know, which prevails at courts, and at the head of armies, and in senates as much as at the loom and in the field.
The English people are satisfied that to the great the consolations of religion are as necessary as its instructions. They, too, are among the unhappy. They feel personal pain and domestic sorrow. In these they have no privilege, but are subject to pay their full contingent to the contributions levied on mortality. They want this sovereign balm under their gnawing cares and anxieties, which, being less conversant about the limited wants of animal life, range without limit, and are diversified by infinite combinations, in the wild and unbounded regions of imagination. Some charitable dole is wanting to these our often very unhappy brethren to fill the gloomy void that reigns in minds which have nothing on earth to hope or fear; something to relieve in the killing languor and overlabored lassitude of those who have nothing to do; something to excite an appetite to existence in the palled satiety which attends on all pleasures which may be bought where nature is not left to her own process, where even desire is anticipated, and therefore fruition defeated by meditated schemes and contrivances of delight; and no interval, no obstacle, is interposed between the wish and the accomplishment.
The people of England know how little influence the teachers of religion are likely to have with the wealthy and powerful of long standing, and how much less with the newly fortunate, if they appear in a manner no way assorted to those with whom they must associate, and over whom they must even exercise, in some cases, something like an authority. What must they think of that body of teachers if they see it in no part above the establishment of their domestic servants? If the poverty were voluntary, there might be some difference. Strong instances of self-denial operate powerfully on our minds, and a man who has no wants has obtained great freedom and firmness and even dignity. But as the mass of any description of men are but men, and their poverty cannot be voluntary, that disrespect which attends upon all lay poverty will not depart from the ecclesiastical. Our provident constitution has therefore taken care that those who are to instruct presumptuous ignorance, those who are to be censors over insolent vice, should neither incur their contempt nor live upon their alms, nor will it tempt the rich to a neglect of the true medicine of their minds. For these reasons, whilst we provide first for the poor, and with a parental solicitude, we have not relegated religion (like something we were ashamed to show) to obscure municipalities or rustic villages. No! we will have her to exalt her mitred front in courts and parliaments. We will have her mixed throughout the whole mass of life and blended with all the classes of society. The people of England will show to the haughty potentates of the world, and to their talking sophisters, that a free, a generous, an informed nation honors the high magistrates of its church; that it will not suffer the insolence of wealth and titles, or any other species of proud pretension, to look down with scorn upon what they looked up to with reverence; nor presume to trample on that acquired personal nobility which they intend always to be, and which often is, the fruit, not the reward (for what can be the reward?) of learning, piety, and virtue. They can see, without pain or grudging, an archbishop precede a duke. They can see a bishop of Durham, or a bishop of Winchester, in possession of ten thousand pounds a year, and cannot conceive why it is in worse hands than estates to the like amount in the hands of this earl or that squire, although it may be true that so many dogs and horses are not kept by the former and fed with the victuals which ought to nourish the children of the people. It is true, the whole church revenue is not always employed, and to every shilling, in charity, nor perhaps ought it, but something is generally employed. It is better to cherish virtue and humanity by leaving much to free will, even with some loss to the object, than to attempt to make men mere machines and instruments of a political benevolence. The world on the whole will gain by a liberty without which virtue cannot exist.
When once the commonwealth has established the estates of the church as property, it can, consistently, hear nothing of the more or the less. ""Too much"" and ""too little"" are treason against property. What evil can arise from the quantity in any hand whilst the supreme authority has the full, sovereign superintendence over this, as over all property, to prevent every species of abuse, and, whenever it notably deviates, to give to it a direction agreeable to the purposes of its institution?
In England most of us conceive that it is envy and malignity toward those who are often the beginners of their own fortune, and not a love of the self-denial and mortification of the ancient church, that makes some look askance at the distinctions, and honors, and revenues which, taken from no person, are set apart for virtue. The ears of the people of England are distinguishing. They hear these men speak broad. Their tongue betrays them. Their language is in the patois of fraud, in the cant and gibberish of hypocrisy. The people of England must think so when these praters affect to carry back the clergy to that primitive, evangelic poverty which, in the spirit, ought always to exist in them (and in us, too, however we may like it), but in the thing must be varied when the relation of that body to the state is altered — when manners, when modes of life, when indeed the whole order of human affairs has undergone a total revolution. We shall believe those reformers, then, to be honest enthusiasts, not, as now we think them, cheats and deceivers, when we see them throwing their own goods into common and submitting their own persons to the austere discipline of the early church.
With these ideas rooted in their minds, the commons of Great Britain, in the national emergencies, will never seek their resource from the confiscation of the estates of the church and poor. Sacrilege and proscription are not among the ways and means of our committee of supply. The Jews in Change Alley have not yet dared to hint their hopes of a mortgage on the revenues belonging to the see of Canterbury. I am not afraid that I shall be disavowed when I assure you that there is not one public man in this kingdom whom you would wish to quote, no, not one, of any party or description, who does not reprobate the dishonest, perfidious, and cruel confiscation which the National Assembly has been compelled to make of that property which it was their first duty to protect.
It is with the exultation of a little national pride I tell you that those amongst us who have wished to pledge the societies of Paris in the cup of their abominations have been disappointed. The robbery of your church has proved a security to the possession of ours. It has roused the people. They see with horror and alarm that enormous and shameless act of proscription. It has opened, and will more and more open, their eyes upon the selfish enlargement of mind and the narrow liberality of sentiment of insidious men, which, commencing in close hypocrisy and fraud, have ended in open violence and rapine. At home we behold similar beginnings. We are on our guard against similar conclusions.
I HOPE WE SHALL NEVER be so totally lost to all sense of the duties imposed upon us by the law of social union as, upon any pretext of public service, to confiscate the goods of a single unoffending citizen. Who but a tyrant (a name expressive of everything which can vitiate and degrade human nature) could think of seizing on the property of men unaccused, unheard, untried, by whole descriptions, by hundreds and thousands together? Who that had not lost every trace of humanity could think of casting down men of exalted rank and sacred function, some of them of an age to call at once for reverence and compassion, of casting them down from the highest situation in the commonwealth, wherein they were maintained by their own landed property, to a state of indigence, depression, and contempt?
The confiscators truly have made some allowance to their victims from the scraps and fragments of their own tables from which they have been so harshly driven, and which have been so bountifully spread for a feast to the harpies of usury. But to drive men from independence to live on alms is itself great cruelty. That which might be a tolerable condition to men in one state of life, and not habituated to other things, may, when all these circumstances are altered, be a dreadful revolution, and one to which a virtuous mind would feel pain in condemning any guilt except that which would demand the life of the offender. But to many minds this punishment of degradation and infamy is worse than death. Undoubtedly it is an infinite aggravation of this cruel suffering that the persons who were taught a double prejudice in favor of religion, by education and by the place they held in the administration of its functions, are to receive the remnants of their property as alms from the profane and impious hands of those who had plundered them of all the rest; to receive (if they are at all to receive), not from the charitable contributions of the faithful but from the insolent tenderness of known and avowed atheism, the maintenance of religion measured out to them on the standard of the contempt in which it is held, and for the purpose of rendering those who receive the allowance vile and of no estimation in the eyes of mankind.
But this act of seizure of property, it seems, is a judgment in law, and not a confiscation. They have, it seems, found out in the academies of the Palais Royal and the Jacobins that certain men had no right to the possessions which they held under law, usage, the decisions of courts, and the accumulated prescription of a thousand years. They say that ecclesiastics are fictitious persons, creatures of the state, whom at pleasure they may destroy, and of course limit and modify in every particular; that the goods they possess are not properly theirs but belong to the state which created the fiction; and we are therefore not to trouble ourselves with what they may suffer in their natural feelings and natural persons on account of what is done toward them in this their constructive character. Of what import is it under what names you injure men and deprive them of the just emoluments of a profession, in which they were not only permitted but encouraged by the state to engage, and upon the supposed certainty of which emoluments they had formed the plan of their lives, contracted debts, and led multitudes to an entire dependence upon them?
You do not imagine, Sir, that I am going to compliment this miserable distinction of persons with any long discussion. The arguments of tyranny are as contemptible as its force is dreadful. Had not your confiscators, by their early crimes, obtained a power which secures indemnity to all the crimes of which they have since been guilty or that they can commit, it is not the syllogism of the logician, but the lash of the executioner, that would have refuted a sophistry which becomes an accomplice of theft and murder. The sophistic tyrants of Paris are loud in their declamations against the departed regal tyrants, who in former ages have vexed the world. They are thus bold, because they are safe from the dungeons and iron cages of their old masters. Shall we be more tender of the tyrants of our own time, when we see them acting worse tragedies under our eyes? Shall we not use the same liberty that they do, when we can use it with the same safety — when to speak honest truth only requires a contempt of the opinions of those whose actions we abhor?
This outrage on all the rights of property was at first covered with what, on the system of their conduct, was the most astonishing of all pretexts — a regard to national faith. The enemies to property at first pretended a most tender, delicate, and scrupulous anxiety for keeping the king's engagements with the public creditor. These professors of the rights of men are so busy in teaching others that they have not leisure to learn anything themselves; otherwise they would have known that it is to the property of the citizen, and not to the demands of the creditor of the state, that the first and original faith of civil society is pledged. The claim of the citizen is prior in time, paramount in title, superior in equity. The fortunes of individuals, whether possessed by acquisition or by descent or in virtue of a participation in the goods of some community, were no part of the creditor's security, expressed or implied. They never so much as entered into his head when he made his bargain. He well knew that the public, whether represented by a monarch or by a senate, can pledge nothing but the public estate; and it can have no public estate except in what it derives from a just and proportioned imposition upon the citizens at large. This was engaged, and nothing else could be engaged, to the public creditor. No man can mortgage his injustice as a pawn for his fidelity.
It is impossible to avoid some observation on the contradictions caused by the extreme rigor and the extreme laxity of this new public faith which influenced in this transaction, and which influenced not according to the nature of the obligation, but to the description of the persons to whom it was engaged. No acts of the old government of the kings of France are held valid in the National Assembly except its pecuniary engagements: acts of all others of the most ambiguous legality. The rest of the acts of that royal government are considered in so odious a light that to have a claim under its authority is looked on as a sort of crime. A pension, given as a reward for service to the state, is surely as good a ground of property as any security for money advanced to the state. It is better; for money is paid, and well paid, to obtain that service. We have, however, seen multitudes of people under this description in France who never had been deprived of their allowances by the most arbitrary ministers in the most arbitrary times, by this assembly of the rights of men robbed without mercy. They were told, in answer to their claim to the bread earned with their blood, that their services had not been rendered to the country that now exists.
This laxity of public faith is not confined to those unfortunate persons. The Assembly, with perfect consistency it must be owned, is engaged in a respectable deliberation how far it is bound by the treaties made with other nations under the former government, and their committee is to report which of them they ought to ratify, and which not. By this means they have put the external fidelity of this virgin state on a par with its internal.
It is not easy to conceive upon what rational principle the royal government should not, of the two, rather have possessed the power of rewarding service and making treaties, in virtue of its prerogative, than that of pledging to creditors the revenue of the state, actual and possible. The treasure of the nation, of all things, has been the least allowed to the prerogative of the king of France or to the prerogative of any king in Europe. To mortgage the public revenue implies the sovereign dominion, in the fullest sense, over the public purse. It goes far beyond the trust even of a temporary and occasional taxation. The acts, however, of that dangerous power (the distinctive mark of a boundless despotism) have been alone held sacred. Whence arose this preference given by a democratic assembly to a body of property deriving its title from the most critical and obnoxious of all the exertions of monarchical authority? Reason can furnish nothing to reconcile inconsistency, nor can partial favor be accounted for upon equitable principles. But the contradiction and partiality which admit no justification are not the less without an adequate cause; and that cause I do not think it difficult to discover.
By the vast debt of France a great monied interest had insensibly grown up, and with it a great power. By the ancient usages which prevailed in that kingdom, the general circulation of property, and in particular the mutual convertibility of land into money, and of money into land, had always been a matter of difficulty. Family settlements, rather more general and more strict than they are in England, the jus retractus, the great mass of landed property held by the crown, and, by a maxim of the French law, held unalienably, the vast estates of the ecclesiastical corporations — all these had kept the landed and monied interests more separated in France, less miscible, and the owners of the two distinct species of property not so well disposed to each other as they are in this country.
The monied property was long looked on with rather an evil eye by the people. They saw it connected with their distresses, and aggravating them. It was no less envied by the old landed interests, partly for the same reasons that rendered it obnoxious to the people, but much more so as it eclipsed, by the splendor of an ostentatious luxury, the unendowed pedigrees and naked titles of several among the nobility. Even when the nobility which represented the more permanent landed interest united themselves by marriage (which sometimes was the case) with the other description, the wealth which saved the family from ruin was supposed to contaminate and degrade it. Thus the enmities and heartburnings of these parties were increased even by the usual means by which discord is made to cease and quarrels are turned into friendship. In the meantime, the pride of the wealthy men, not noble or newly noble, increased with its cause. They felt with resentment an inferiority, the grounds of which they did not acknowledge. There was no measure to which they were not willing to lend themselves in order to be revenged of the outrages of this rival pride and to exalt their wealth to what they considered as its natural rank and estimation. They struck at the nobility through the crown and the church. They attacked them particularly on the side on which they thought them the most vulnerable, that is, the possessions of the church, which, through the patronage of the crown, generally devolved upon the nobility.
The bishoprics and the great commendatory abbeys were, with few exceptions, held by that order.
In this state of real, though not always perceived, warfare between the noble ancient landed interest and the new monied interest, the greatest, because the most applicable, strength was in the hands of the latter. The monied interest is in its nature more ready for any adventure, and its possessors more disposed to new enterprises of any kind. Being of a recent acquisition, it falls in more naturally with any novelties. It is therefore the kind of wealth which will be resorted to by all who wish for change.
Along with the monied interest, a new description of men had grown up with whom that interest soon formed a close and marked union — I mean the political men of letters. Men of letters, fond of distinguishing themselves, are rarely averse to innovation. Since the decline of the life and greatness of Louis the Fourteenth, they were not so much cultivated, either by him or by the regent or the successors to the crown, nor were they engaged to the court by favors and emoluments so systematically as during the splendid period of that ostentatious and not impolitic reign. What they lost in the old court protection, they endeavored to make up by joining in a sort of incorporation of their own; to which the two academies of France, and afterwards the vast undertaking of the Encyclopedia, carried on by a society of these gentlemen, did not a little contribute.
The literary cabal had some years ago formed something like a regular plan for the destruction of the Christian religion. This object they pursued with a degree of zeal which hitherto had been discovered only in the propagators of some system of piety. They were possessed with a spirit of proselytism in the most fanatical degree; and from thence, by an easy progress, with the spirit of persecution according to their means. What was not to be done toward their great end by any direct or immediate act might be wrought by a longer process through the medium of opinion. To command that opinion, the first step is to establish a dominion over those who direct it. They contrived to possess themselves, with great method and perseverance, of all the avenues to literary fame. Many of them indeed stood high in the ranks of literature and science. The world had done them justice and in favor of general talents forgave the evil tendency of their peculiar principles. This was true liberality, which they returned by endeavoring to confine the reputation of sense, learning, and taste to themselves or their followers. I will venture to say that this narrow, exclusive spirit has not been less prejudicial to literature and to taste than to morals and true philosophy. These atheistical fathers have a bigotry of their own, and they have learned to talk against monks with the spirit of a monk. But in some things they are men of the world. The resources of intrigue are called in to supply the defects of argument and wit. To this system of literary monopoly was joined an unremitting industry to blacken and discredit in every way, and by every means, all those who did not hold to their faction. To those who have observed the spirit of their conduct it has long been clear that nothing was wanted but the power of carrying the intolerance of the tongue and of the pen into a persecution which would strike at property, liberty, and life.
The desultory and faint persecution carried on against them, more from compliance with form and decency than with serious resentment, neither weakened their strength nor relaxed their efforts. The issue of the whole was that, what with opposition, and what with success, a violent and malignant zeal, of a kind hitherto unknown in the world, had taken an entire possession of their minds and rendered their whole conversation, which otherwise would have been pleasing and instructive, perfectly disgusting. A spirit of cabal, intrigue, and proselytism pervaded all their thoughts, words, and actions. And as controversial zeal soon turns its thoughts on force, they began to insinuate themselves into a correspondence with foreign princes, in hopes through their authority, which at first they flattered, they might bring about the changes they had in view. To them it was indifferent whether these changes were to be accomplished by the thunderbolt of despotism or by the earthquake of popular commotion. The correspondence between this cabal and the late king of Prussia will throw no small light upon the spirit of all their proceedings. For the same purpose for which they intrigued with princes, they cultivated, in a distinguished manner, the monied interest of France; and partly through the means furnished by those whose peculiar offices gave them the most extensive and certain means of communication, they carefully occupied all the avenues to opinion.
Writers, especially when they act in a body and with one direction, have great influence on the public mind; the alliance, therefore, of these writers with the monied interest had no small effect in removing the popular odium and envy which attended that species of wealth. These writers, like the propagators of all novelties, pretended to a great zeal for the poor and the lower orders, whilst in their satires they rendered hateful, by every exaggeration, the faults of courts, of nobility, and of priesthood. They became a sort of demagogues. They served as a link to unite, in favor of one object, obnoxious wealth to restless and desperate poverty.
As these two kinds of men appear principal leaders in all the late transactions, their junction and politics will serve to account, not upon any principles of law or of policy, but as a cause, for the general fury with which all the landed property of ecclesiastical corporations has been attacked; and the great care which, contrary to their pretended principles, has been taken of a monied interest originating from the authority of the crown. All the envy against wealth and power was artificially directed against other descriptions of riches. On what other principle than that which I have stated can we account for an appearance so extraordinary and unnatural as that of the ecclesiastical possessions, which had stood so many successions of ages and shocks of civil violences, and were girded at once by justice and by prejudice, being applied to the payment of debts comparatively recent, invidious, and contracted by a decried and subverted government?
WAS the public estate a sufficient stake for the public debts? Assume that it was not, and that a loss must be incurred somewhere. — When the only estate lawfully possessed, and which the contracting parties had in contemplation at the time in which their bargain was made, happens to fail, who according to the principles of natural and legal equity ought to be the sufferer? Certainly it ought to be either the party who trusted or the party who persuaded him to trust, or both, and not third parties who had no concern with the transaction. Upon any insolvency they ought to suffer who are weak enough to lend upon bad security, or they who fraudulently held out a security that was not valid. Laws are acquainted with no other rules of decision. But by the new institute of the rights of men, the only persons who in equity ought to suffer are the only persons who are to be saved harmless: those are to answer the debt who neither were lenders nor borrowers, mortgagers nor mortgagees.
What had the clergy to do with these transactions? What had they to do with any public engagement further than the extent of their own debt? To that, to be sure, their estates were bound to the last acre. Nothing can lead more to the true spirit of the Assembly, which sits for public confiscation, with its new equity and its new morality, than an attention to their proceeding with regard to this debt of the clergy. The body of confiscators, true to that monied interest for which they were false to every other, have found the clergy competent to incur a legal debt. Of course, they declared them legally entitled to the property which their power of incurring the debt and mortgaging the estate implied, recognizing the rights of those persecuted citizens in the very act in which they were thus grossly violated.
If, as I said, any persons are to make good deficiencies to the public creditor, besides the public at large, they must be those who managed the agreement. Why, therefore, are not the estates of all the comptrollers-general confiscated? Why not those of the long succession of ministers, financiers, and bankers who have been enriched whilst the nation was impoverished by their dealings and their counsels? Why is not the estate of M. Laborde declared forfeited rather than of the archbishop of Paris, who has had nothing to do in the creation or in the jobbing of the public funds? Or, if you must confiscate old landed estates in favor of the money-jobbers, why is the penalty confined to one description? I do not know whether the expenses of the Duke de Choiseul have left anything of the infinite sums which he had derived from the bounty of his master during the transactions of a reign which contributed largely by every species of prodigality in war and peace to the present debt of France. If any such remains, why is not this confiscated? I remember to have been in Paris during the time of the old government. I was there just after the Duke d'Aiguillon had been snatched (as it was generally thought) from the block by the hand of a protecting despotism.
He was a minister and had some concern in the affairs of that prodigal period. Why do I not see his estate delivered up to the municipalities in which it is situated? The noble family of Noailles have long been servants (meritorious servants I admit) to the crown of France, and have had, of course, some share in its bounties. Why do I hear nothing of the application of their estates to the public debt? Why is the estate of the Duke de Rochefoucault more sacred than that of the Cardinal de Rochefoucault? The former is, I doubt not, a worthy person, and (if it were not a sort of profaneness to talk of the use, as affecting the title to the property) he makes a good use of his revenues; but it is no disrespect to him to say, what authentic information well warrants me in saying, that the use made of a property equally valid by his brother,  the cardinal archbishop of Rouen, was far more laudable and far more public-spirited. Can one hear of the proscription of such persons and the confiscation of their effects without indignation and horror? He is not a man who does not feel such emotions on such occasions. He does not deserve the name of a freeman who will not express them.
Few barbarous conquerors have ever made so terrible a revolution in property. None of the heads of the Roman factions, when they established crudelem illam hastam in all their auctions of rapine, have ever set up to sale the goods of the conquered citizen to such an enormous amount. It must be allowed in favor of those tyrants of antiquity that what was done by them could hardly be said to be done in cold blood. Their passions were inflamed, their tempers soured, their understandings confused with the spirit of revenge, with the innumerable reciprocated and recent inflictions and retaliations of blood and rapine. They were driven beyond all bounds of moderation by the apprehension of the return of power, with the return of property, to the families of those they had injured beyond all hope of forgiveness.
These Roman confiscators, who were yet only in the elements of tyranny, and were not instructed in the rights of men to exercise all sorts of cruelties on each other without provocation, thought it necessary to spread a sort of color over their injustice.
They considered the vanquished party as composed of traitors who had borne arms, or otherwise had acted with hostility, against the commonwealth. They regarded them as persons who had forfeited their property by their crimes. With you, in your improved state of the human mind, there was no such formality. You seized upon five millions sterling of annual rent and turned forty or fifty thousand human creatures out of their houses, because ""such was your pleasure"". The tyrant Harry the Eighth of England, as he was not better enlightened than the Roman Mariuses and Sullas, and had not studied in your new schools, did not know what an effectual instrument of despotism was to be found in that grand magazine of offensive weapons, the rights of men. When he resolved to rob the abbeys, as the club of the Jacobins have robbed all the ecclesiastics, he began by setting on foot a commission to examine into the crimes and abuses which prevailed in those communities. As it might be expected, his commission reported truths, exaggerations, and falsehoods. But truly or falsely, it reported abuses and offenses. However, as abuses might be corrected, as every crime of persons does not infer a forfeiture with regard to communities, and as property, in that dark age, was not discovered to be a creature of prejudice, all those abuses (and there were enough of them) were hardly thought sufficient ground for such a confiscation as it was for his purpose to make. He, therefore, procured the formal surrender of these estates. All these operose proceedings were adopted by one of the most decided tyrants in the rolls of history as necessary preliminaries before he could venture, by bribing the members of his two servile houses with a share of the spoil and holding out to them an eternal immunity from taxation, to demand a confirmation of his iniquitous proceedings by an act of Parliament. Had fate reserved him to our times, four technical terms would have done his business and saved him all this trouble; he needed nothing more than one short form of incantation — ""Philosophy, Light, Liberality, the Rights of Men"".
I can say nothing in praise of those acts of tyranny which no voice has hitherto ever commended under any of their false colors, yet in these false colors an homage was paid by despotism to justice. The power which was above all fear and all remorse was not set above all shame. Whilst shame keeps its watch, virtue is not wholly extinguished in the heart, nor will moderation be utterly exiled from the minds of tyrants.
I believe every honest man sympathizes in his reflections with our political poet on that occasion, and will pray to avert the omen whenever these acts of rapacious despotism present themselves to his view or his imagination: —
    May no such storm
    Fall on our times, where ruin must reform.
    Tell me (my Muse) what monstrous dire offense,
    What crimes could any Christian king incense
    To such a rage? Was't luxury, or lust?
    Was he so temperate, so chaste, so just?
    Were these their crimes? they were his own much more,
    But wealth is crime enough to him that's poor.
This same wealth, which is at all times treason and lese nation to indigent and rapacious despotism, under all modes of polity, was your temptation to violate property, law, and religion, united in one object. But was the state of France so wretched and undone that no other recourse but rapine remained to preserve its existence? On this point I wish to receive some information. When the states met, was the condition of the finances of France such that, after economizing on principles of justice and mercy through all departments, no fair repartition of burdens upon all the orders could possibly restore them? If such an equal imposition would have been sufficient, you well know it might easily have been made. M. Necker, in the budget which he laid before the orders assembled at Versailles, made a detailed exposition of the state of the French nation.
If we give credit to him, it was not necessary to have recourse to any new impositions whatsoever to put the receipts of France on a balance with its expenses. He stated the permanent charges of all descriptions, including the interest of a new loan of four hundred millions, at 531,444,000 livres; the fixed revenue at 475,294,000, making the deficiency 56,150,000, or short of £2,200,000 sterling. But to balance it, he brought forward savings and improvements of revenue (considered as entirely certain) to rather more than the amount of that deficiency; and he concludes with these emphatical words (p. 39), ""Quel pays, Messieurs, que celui, ou, sans impots et avec de simples objets inappercus, on peut faire disparoitre un deficit qui a fait tant de bruit en Europe"". As to the reimbursement, the sinking of debt, and the other great objects of public credit and political arrangement indicated in Mons. Necker's speech, no doubt could be entertained but that a very moderate and proportioned assessment on the citizens without distinction would have provided for all of them to the fullest extent of their demand.
If this representation of Mons. Necker was false, then the Assembly are in the highest degree culpable for having forced the king to accept as his minister and, since the king's deposition, for having employed as their minister a man who had been capable of abusing so notoriously the confidence of his master and their own, in a matter, too, of the highest moment and directly appertaining to his particular office. But if the representation was exact (as having always, along with you, conceived a high degree of respect for M. Necker, I make no doubt it was), then what can be said in favor of those who, instead of moderate, reasonable, and general contribution, have in cold blood, and impelled by no necessity, had recourse to a partial and cruel confiscation?
Was that contribution refused on a pretext of privilege, either on the part of the clergy or on that of the nobility? No, certainly. As to the clergy, they even ran before the wishes of the third order. Previous to the meeting of the states, they had in all their instructions expressly directed their deputies to renounce every immunity which put them upon a footing distinct from the condition of their fellow subjects. In this renunciation the clergy were even more explicit than the nobility.
But let us suppose that the deficiency had remained at the fifty-six millions (or £2,200,000 sterling), as at first stated by M. Necker. Let us allow that all the resources he opposed to that deficiency were impudent and groundless fictions, and that the Assembly (or their lords of articles  at the Jacobins) were from thence justified in laying the whole burden of that deficiency on the clergy yet allowing all this, a necessity of £2,200,000 sterling will not support a confiscation to the amount of five millions. The imposition of £2,200,000 on the clergy, as partial, would have been oppressive and unjust, but it would not have been altogether ruinous to those on whom it was imposed, and therefore it would not have answered the real purpose of the managers.
Perhaps persons unacquainted with the state of France, on hearing the clergy and the noblesse were privileged in point of taxation, may be led to imagine that, previous to the Revolution, these bodies had contributed nothing to the state. This is a great mistake. They certainly did not contribute equally with each other, nor either of them equally with the commons. They both, however, contributed largely. Neither nobility nor clergy enjoyed any exemption from the excise on consumable commodities, from duties of custom, or from any of the other numerous indirect impositions, which in France, as well as here, make so very large a proportion of all payments to the public. The noblesse paid the capitation. They paid also a land-tax, called the twentieth penny, to the height sometimes of three, sometimes of four, shillings in the pound — both of them direct impositions of no light nature and no trivial produce. The clergy of the provinces annexed by conquest to France (which in extent make about an eighth part of the whole, but in wealth a much larger proportion) paid likewise to the capitation and the twentieth penny, at the rate paid by the nobility. The clergy in the old provinces did not pay the capitation, but they had redeemed themselves at the expense of about 24 millions, or a little more than a million sterling. They were exempted from the twentieths; but then they made free gifts, they contracted debts for the state, and they were subject to some other charges, the whole computed at about a thirteenth part of their clear income. They ought to have paid annually about forty thousand pounds more to put them on a par with the contribution of the nobility.
When the terrors of this tremendous proscription hung over the clergy, they made an offer of a contribution through the archbishop of Aix, which, for its extravagance, ought not to have been accepted. But it was evidently and obviously more advantageous to the public creditor than anything which could rationally be promised by the confiscation. Why was it not accepted? The reason is plain: there was no desire that the church should be brought to serve the state. The service of the state was made a pretext to destroy the church. In their way to the destruction of the church they would not scruple to destroy their country; and they have destroyed it. One great end in the project would have been defeated if the plan of extortion had been adopted in lieu of the scheme of confiscation. The new landed interest connected with the new republic, and connected with it for its very being, could not have been created. This was among the reasons why that extravagant ransom was not accepted.
THE madness of the project of confiscation, on the plan that was first pretended, soon became apparent. To bring this unwieldy mass of landed property, enlarged by the confiscation of all the vast landed domain of the crown, at once into market was obviously to defeat the profits proposed by the confiscation by depreciating the value of those lands and, indeed, of all the landed estates throughout France. Such a sudden diversion of all its circulating money from trade to land must be an additional mischief What step was taken? Did the Assembly, on becoming sensible of the inevitable ill effects of their projected sale, revert to the offers of the clergy? No distress could oblige them to travel in a course which was disgraced by any appearance of justice. Giving over all hopes from a general immediate sale, another project seems to have succeeded. They proposed to take stock in exchange for the church lands. In that project great difficulties arose in equalizing the objects to be exchanged. Other obstacles also presented themselves, which threw them back again upon some project of sale. The municipalities had taken an alarm. They would not hear of transferring the whole plunder of the kingdom to the stockholders in Paris. Many of those municipalities had been (upon system) reduced to the most deplorable indigence. Money was nowhere to be seen. They were, therefore, led to the point that was so ardently desired. They panted for a currency of any kind which might revive their perishing industry. The municipalities were then to be admitted to a share in the spoil, which evidently rendered the first scheme (if ever it had been seriously entertained) altogether impracticable. Public exigencies pressed upon all sides. The minister of finance reiterated his call for supply with a most urgent, anxious, and boding voice. Thus pressed on all sides, instead of the first plan of converting their bankers into bishops and abbots, instead of paying the old debt, they contracted a new debt at 3 per cent, creating a new paper currency founded on an eventual sale of the church lands. They issued this paper currency to satisfy in the first instance chiefly the demands made upon them by the bank of discount, the great machine, or paper-mill, of their fictitious wealth.
The spoil of the church was now become the only resource of all their operations in finance, the vital principle of all their politics, the sole security for the existence of their power. It was necessary by all, even the most violent means, to put every individual on the same bottom, and to bind the nation in one guilty interest to uphold this act and the authority of those by whom it was done. In order to force the most reluctant into a participation of their pillage, they rendered their paper circulation compulsory in all payments. Those who consider the general tendency of their schemes to this one object as a center, and a center from which afterwards all their measures radiate, will not think that I dwell too long upon this part of the proceedings of the National Assembly.
To cut off all appearance of connection between the crown and public justice, and to bring the whole under implicit obedience to the dictators in Paris, the old independent judicature of the parliaments, with all its merits and all its faults, was wholly abolished. Whilst the parliaments existed, it was evident that the people might some time or other come to resort to them and rally under the standard of their ancient laws. It became, however, a matter of consideration that the magistrates and officers, in the courts now abolished, had purchased their places at a very high rate, for which, as well as for the duty they performed, they received but a very low return of interest. Simple confiscation is a boon only for the clergy; to the lawyers some appearances of equity are to be observed, and they are to receive compensation to an immense amount. Their compensation becomes part of the national debt, for the liquidation of which there is the one exhaustless fund. The lawyers are to obtain their compensation in the new church paper, which is to march with the new principles of judicature and legislature. The dismissed magistrates are to take their share of martyrdom with the ecclesiastics, or to receive their own property from such a fund, and in such a manner, as all those who have been seasoned with the ancient principles of jurisprudence and had been the sworn guardians of property must look upon with horror. Even the clergy are to receive their miserable allowance out of the depreciated paper, which is stamped with the indelible character of sacrilege and with the symbols of their own ruin, or they must starve. So violent an outrage upon credit, property, and liberty as this compulsory paper currency has seldom been exhibited by the alliance of bankruptcy and tyranny, at any time or in any nation.
In the course of all these operations, at length comes out the grand arcanum — that in reality, and in a fair sense, the lands of the church (so far as anything certain can be gathered from their proceedings) are not to be sold at all. By the late resolutions of the National Assembly, they are, indeed, to be delivered to the highest bidder. But it is to be observed that a certain portion only of the purchase money is to be laid down. A period of twelve years is to be given for the payment of the rest. The philosophic purchasers are therefore, on payment of a sort of fine, to be put instantly into possession of the estate. It becomes in some respects a sort of gift to them — to be held on the feudal tenure of zeal to the new establishment. This project is evidently to let in a body of purchasers without money. The consequence will be that these purchasers, or rather grantees, will pay, not only from the rents as they accrue, which might as well be received by the state, but from the spoil of the materials of buildings, from waste in woods, and from whatever money, by hands habituated to the gripings of usury, they can wring from the miserable peasant. He is to be delivered over to the mercenary and arbitrary discretion of men who will be stimulated to every species of extortion by the growing demands on the growing profits of an estate held under the precarious settlement of a new political system.
When all the frauds, impostures, violences, rapines, burnings, murders, confiscations, compulsory paper currencies, and every description of tyranny and cruelty employed to bring about and to uphold this Revolution have their natural effect, that is, to shock the moral sentiments of all virtuous and sober minds, the abettors of this philosophic system immediately strain their throats in a declamation against the old monarchical government of France. When they have rendered that deposed power sufficiently black, they then proceed in argument as if all those who disapprove of their new abuses must of course be partisans of the old, that those who reprobate their crude and violent schemes of liberty ought to be treated as advocates for servitude. I admit that their necessities do compel them to this base and contemptible fraud. Nothing can reconcile men to their proceedings and projects but the supposition that there is no third option between them and some tyranny as odious as can be furnished by the records of history, or by the invention of poets. This prattling of theirs hardly deserves the name of sophistry. It is nothing but plain impudence. Have these gentlemen never heard, in the whole circle of the worlds of theory and practice, of anything between the despotism of the monarch and the despotism of the multitude? Have they never heard of a monarchy directed by laws, controlled and balanced by the great hereditary wealth and hereditary dignity of a nation, and both again controlled by a judicious check from the reason and feeling of the people at large acting by a suitable and permanent organ? Is it then impossible that a man may be found who, without criminal ill intention or pitiable absurdity, shall prefer such a mixed and tempered government to either of the extremes, and who may repute that nation to be destitute of all wisdom and of all virtue which, having in its choice to obtain such a government with ease, or rather to confirm it when actually possessed, thought proper to commit a thousand crimes and to subject their country to a thousand evils in order to avoid it? Is it then a truth so universally acknowledged that a pure democracy is the only tolerable form into which human society can be thrown, that a man is not permitted to hesitate about its merits without the suspicion of being a friend to tyranny, that is, of being a foe to mankind?
I do not know under what description to class the present ruling authority in France. It affects to be a pure democracy, though I think it in a direct train of becoming shortly a mischievous and ignoble oligarchy. But for the present I admit it to be a contrivance of the nature and effect of what it pretends to. I reprobate no form of government merely upon abstract principles. There may be situations in which the purely democratic form will become necessary. There may be some (very few, and very particularly circumstanced) where it would be clearly desirable. This I do not take to be the case of France or of any other great country. Until now, we have seen no examples of considerable democracies. The ancients were better acquainted with them. Not being wholly unread in the authors who had seen the most of those constitutions, and who best understood them, I cannot help concurring with their opinion that an absolute democracy, no more than absolute monarchy, is to be reckoned among the legitimate forms of government. They think it rather the corruption and degeneracy than the sound constitution of a republic. If I recollect rightly, Aristotle observes that a democracy has many striking points of resemblance with a tyranny. Of this I am certain, that in a democracy the majority of the citizens is capable of exercising the most cruel oppressions upon the minority whenever strong divisions prevail in that kind of polity, as they often must; and that oppression of the minority will extend to far greater numbers and will be carried on with much greater fury than can almost ever be apprehended from the dominion of a single scepter. In such a popular persecution, individual sufferers are in a much more deplorable condition than in any other. Under a cruel prince they have the balmy compassion of mankind to assuage the smart of their wounds; they have the plaudits of the people to animate their generous constancy under their sufferings; but those who are subjected to wrong under multitudes are deprived of all external consolation. They seem deserted by mankind, overpowered by a conspiracy of their whole species.
BUT ADMITTING DEMOCRACY not to have that inevitable tendency to party tyranny, which I suppose it to have, and admitting it to possess as much good in it when unmixed as I am sure it possesses when compounded with other forms, does monarchy, on its part, contain nothing at all to recommend it? I do not often quote Bolingbroke, nor have his works in general left any permanent impression on my mind. He is a presumptuous and a superficial writer. But he has one observation which, in my opinion, is not without depth and solidity. He says that he prefers a monarchy to other governments because you can better ingraft any description of republic on a monarchy than anything of monarchy upon the republican forms. I think him perfectly in the right. The fact is so historically, and it agrees well with the speculation.
I know how easy a topic it is to dwell on the faults of departed greatness. By a revolution in the state, the fawning sycophant of yesterday is converted into the austere critic of the present hour. But steady, independent minds, when they have an object of so serious a concern to mankind as government under their contemplation, will disdain to assume the part of satirists and declaimers. They will judge of human institutions as they do of human characters. They will sort out the good from the evil, which is mixed in mortal institutions, as it is in mortal men.
YOUR government in France, though usually, and I think justly, reputed the best of the unqualified or ill-qualified monarchies, was still full of abuses. These abuses accumulated in a length of time, as they must accumulate in every monarchy not under the constant inspection of a popular representative. I am no stranger to the faults and defects of the subverted government of France, and I think I am not inclined by nature or policy to make a panegyric upon anything which is a just and natural object of censure. But the question is not now of the vices of that monarchy, but of its existence. Is it, then, true that the French government was such as to be incapable or undeserving of reform, so that it was of absolute necessity that the whole fabric should be at once pulled down and the area cleared for the erection of a theoretic, experimental edifice in its place? All France was of a different opinion in the beginning of the year 1789. The instructions to the representatives to the States-General, from every district in that kingdom, were filled with projects for the reformation of that government without the remotest suggestion of a design to destroy it. Had such a design been even insinuated, I believe there would have been but one voice, and that voice for rejecting it with scorn and horror. Men have been sometimes led by degrees, sometimes hurried, into things of which, if they could have seen the whole together, they never would have permitted the most remote approach. When those instructions were given, there was no question but that abuses existed, and that they demanded a reform; nor is there now. In the interval between the instructions and the revolution things changed their shape; and in consequence of that change, the true question at present is, Whether those who would have reformed or those who have destroyed are in the right?
To hear some men speak of the late monarchy of France, you would imagine that they were talking of Persia bleeding under the ferocious sword of Tahmas Kouli Khan, or at least describing the barbarous anarchic despotism of Turkey, where the finest countries in the most genial climates in the world are wasted by peace more than any countries have been worried by war, where arts are unknown, where manufactures languish, where science is extinguished, where agriculture decays, where the human race itself melts away and perishes under the eye of the observer. Was this the case of France? I have no way of determining the question but by reference to facts. Facts do not support this resemblance. Along with much evil there is some good in monarchy itself, and some corrective to its evil from religion, from laws, from manners, from opinions the French monarchy must have received, which rendered it (though by no means a free, and therefore by no means a good, constitution) a despotism rather in appearance than in reality.
AMONG the standards upon which the effects of government on any country are to be estimated, I must consider the state of its population as not the least certain. No country in which population flourishes and is in progressive improvement can be under a very mischievous government. About sixty years ago, the Intendants of the generalities of France made, with other matters, a report of the population of their several districts. I have not the books, which are very voluminous, by me, nor do I know where to procure them (I am obliged to speak by memory, and therefore the less positively), but I think the population of France was by them, even at that period, estimated at twenty-two millions of souls. At the end of the last century it had been generally calculated at eighteen. On either of these estimations, France was not ill peopled. M. Necker, who is an authority for his own time, at least equal to the Intendants for theirs, reckons, and upon apparently sure principles, the people of France in the year 1780 at twenty-four millions six hundred and seventy thousand. But was this the probable ultimate term under the old establishment? Dr. Price is of opinion that the growth of population in France was by no means at its acme in that year. I certainly defer to Dr. Price's authority a good deal more in these speculations than I do in his general politics. This gentleman, taking ground on M. Necker's data, is very confident that since the period of that minister's calculation the French population has increased rapidly — so rapidly that in the year 1789 he will not consent to rate the people of that kingdom at a lower number than thirty millions. After abating much (and much I think ought to be abated) from the sanguine calculation of Dr. Price, I have no doubt that the population of France did increase considerably during this later period; but supposing that it increased to nothing more than will be sufficient to complete the twenty-four millions six hundred and seventy thousand to twenty-five millions, still a population of twenty-five millions, and that in an increasing progress, on a space of about twenty-seven thousand square leagues is immense. It is, for instance, a good deal more than the proportionable population of this island, or even than that of England, the best peopled part of the United Kingdom.
It is not universally true that France is a fertile country. Considerable tracts of it are barren and labor under other natural disadvantages. In the portions of that territory where things are more favorable, as far as I am able to discover, the numbers of the people correspond to the indulgence of nature. The Generality of Lisle (this I admit is the strongest example) upon an extent of four hundred and four leagues and a half, about ten years ago, contained seven hundred and thirty-four thousand six hundred souls, which is one thousand seven hundred and seventy-two inhabitants to each square league. The middle term for the rest of France is about nine hundred inhabitants to the same admeasurement.
I do not attribute this population to the deposed government, because I do not like to compliment the contrivances of men with what is due in a great degree to the bounty of Providence. But that decried government could not have obstructed, most probably it favored, the operation of those causes (whatever they were), whether of nature in the soil or habits of industry among the people, which has produced so large a number of the species throughout that whole kingdom and exhibited in some particular places such prodigies of population. I never will suppose that fabric of a state to be the worst of all political institutions which, by experience, is found to contain a principle favorable (however latent it may be) to the increase of mankind.
The wealth of a country is another, and no contemptible, standard by which we may judge whether, on the whole, a government be protecting or destructive. France far exceeds England in the multitude of her people, but I apprehend that her comparative wealth is much inferior to ours, that it is not so equal in the distribution, nor so ready in the circulation. I believe the difference in the form of the two governments to be amongst the causes of this advantage on the side of England. I speak of England, not of the whole British dominions, which, if compared with those of France, will, in some degree, weaken the comparative rate of wealth upon our side. But that wealth, which will not endure a comparison with the riches of England, may constitute a very respectable degree of opulence. M. Necker's book, published in 1785, contains an accurate and interesting collection of facts relative to public economy and to political arithmetic; and his speculations on the subject are in general wise and liberal. In that work he gives an idea of the state of France very remote from the portrait of a country whose government was a perfect grievance, an absolute evil, admitting no cure but through the violent and uncertain remedy of a total revolution. He affirms that from the year 1726 to the year 1784 there was coined at the mint of France, in the species of gold and silver, to the amount of about one hundred millions of pounds sterling.
It is impossible that M. Necker should be mistaken in the amount of the bullion which has been coined in the mint. It is a matter of official record. The reasonings of this able financier, concerning the quantity of gold and silver which remained for circulation, when he wrote in 1785, that is, about four years before the deposition and imprisonment of the French king, are not of equal certainty, but they are laid on grounds so apparently solid that it is not easy to refuse a considerable degree of assent to his calculation. He calculates the numeraire, or what we call ""specie"", then actually existing in France at about eighty-eight millions of the same English money. A great accumulation of wealth for one country, large as that country is! M. Necker was so far from considering this influx of wealth as likely to cease, when he wrote in 1785, that he presumes upon a future annual increase of two per cent upon the money brought into France during the periods from which he computed.
Some adequate cause must have originally introduced all the money coined at its mint into that kingdom, and some cause as operative must have kept at home, or returned into its bosom, such a vast flood of treasure as M. Necker calculates to remain for domestic circulation. Suppose any reasonable deductions from M. Necker's computation, the remainder must still amount to an immense sum. Causes thus powerful to acquire, and to retain, cannot be found in discouraged industry, insecure property, and a positively destructive government. Indeed, when I consider the face of the kingdom of France, the multitude and opulence of her cities, the useful magnificence of her spacious high roads and bridges, the opportunity of her artificial canals and navigations opening the conveniences of maritime communication through a solid continent of so immense an extent; when I turn my eyes to the stupendous works of her ports and harbors, and to her whole naval apparatus, whether for war or trade; when I bring before my view the number of her fortifications, constructed with so bold and masterly a skill and made and maintained at so prodigious a charge, presenting an armed front and impenetrable barrier to her enemies upon every side; when I recollect how very small a part of that extensive region is without cultivation, and to what complete perfection the culture of many of the best productions of the earth have been brought in France; when I reflect on the excellence of her manufactures and fabrics, second to none but ours, and in some particulars not second; when I contemplate the grand foundations of charity, public and private; when I survey the state of all the arts that beautify and polish life; when I reckon the men she has bred for extending her fame in war, her able statesmen, the multitude of her profound lawyers and theologians, her philosophers, her critics, her historians and antiquaries, her poets and her orators, sacred and profane — I behold in all this something which awes and commands the imagination, which checks the mind on the brink of precipitate and indiscriminate censure, and which demands that we should very seriously examine what and how great are the latent vices that could authorize us at once to level so spacious a fabric with the ground. I do not recognize in this view of things the despotism of Turkey. Nor do I discern the character of a government that has been, on the whole, so oppressive or so corrupt or so negligent as to be utterly unfit for all reformation. I must think such a government well deserved to have its excellence heightened, its faults corrected, and its capacities improved into a British constitution.
Whoever has examined into the proceedings of that deposed government for several years back cannot fail to have observed, amidst the inconstancy and fluctuation natural to courts, an earnest endeavor toward the prosperity and improvement of the country; he must admit that it had long been employed, in some instances wholly to remove, in many considerably to correct, the abusive practices and usages that had prevailed in the state, and that even the unlimited power of the sovereign over the persons of his subjects, inconsistent, as undoubtedly it was, with law and liberty, had yet been every day growing more mitigated in the exercise. So far from refusing itself to reformation, that government was open, with a censurable degree of facility, to all sorts of projects and projectors on the subject. Rather too much countenance was given to the spirit of innovation, which soon was turned against those who fostered it, and ended in their ruin. It is but cold, and no very flattering, justice to that fallen monarchy to say that, for many years, it trespassed more by levity and want of judgment in several of its schemes than from any defect in diligence or in public spirit. To compare the government of France for the last fifteen or sixteen years with wise and well-constituted establishments during that, or during any period, is not to act with fairness. But if in point of prodigality in the expenditure of money, or in point of rigor in the exercise of power, it be compared with any of the former reigns, I believe candid judges will give little credit to the good intentions of those who dwell perpetually on the donations to favorites, or on the expenses of the court, or on the horrors of the Bastille in the reign of Louis the Sixteenth.
WHETHER the system, if it deserves such a name, now built on the ruins of that ancient monarchy will be able to give a better account of the population and wealth of the country which it has taken under its care, is a matter very doubtful. Instead of improving by the change, I apprehend that a long series of years must be told before it can recover in any degree the effects of this philosophic revolution, and before the nation can be replaced on its former footing. If Dr. Price should think fit, a few years hence, to favor us with an estimate of the population of France, he will hardly be able to make up his tale of thirty millions of souls, as computed in 1789, or the Assembly's computation of twenty-six millions of that year, or even M. Necker's twenty-five millions in 1780. I hear that there are considerable emigrations from France, and that many, quitting that voluptuous climate and that seductive Circean liberty, have taken refuge in the frozen regions, and under the British despotism, of Canada.
In the present disappearance of coin, no person could think it the same country in which the present minister of the finances has been able to discover fourscore millions sterling in specie. From its general aspect one would conclude that it had been for some time past under the special direction of the learned academicians of Laputa and Balnibarbi. Already the population of Paris has so declined that M. Necker stated to the National Assembly the provision to be made for its subsistence at a fifth less than what had formerly been found requisite. It is said (and I have never heard it contradicted) that a hundred thousand people are out of employment in that city, though it is become the seat of the imprisoned court and National Assembly. Nothing, I am credibly informed, can exceed the shocking and disgusting spectacle of mendicancy displayed in that capital. Indeed the votes of the National Assembly leave no doubt of the fact. They have lately appointed a standing committee of mendicancy.
They are contriving at once a vigorous police on this subject and, for the first time, the imposition of a tax to maintain the poor, for whose present relief great sums appear on the face of the public accounts of the year.  In the meantime the leaders of the legislative clubs and coffee-houses are intoxicated with admiration at their own wisdom and ability. They speak with the most sovereign contempt of the rest of the world. They tell the people, to comfort them in the rags with which they have clothed them, that they are a nation of philosophers; and sometimes by all the arts of quackish parade, by show, tumult, and bustle, sometimes by the alarms of plots and invasions, they attempt to drown the cries of indigence and to divert the eyes of the observer from the ruin and wretchedness of the state. A brave people will certainly prefer liberty accompanied with a virtuous poverty to a depraved and wealthy servitude. But before the price of comfort and opulence is paid, one ought to be pretty sure it is real liberty which is purchased, and that she is to be purchased at no other price. I shall always, however, consider that liberty as very equivocal in her appearance which has not wisdom and justice for her companions and does not lead prosperity and plenty in her train.
When I sent this book to the press, I entertained some doubt concerning the nature and extent of the last article in the above accounts, which is only under a general head, without any detail. Since then I have seen M. de Calonne's work. I must think it a great loss to me that I had not that advantage earlier. M. de Calonne thinks this article to be on account of general subsistence; but as he is not able to comprehend how so great a loss as upwards of £1,661,000 sterling could be sustained on the difference between the price and the sale of grain, he seems to attribute this enormous head of charge to secret expenses of the Revolution. I cannot say anything positively on that subject. The reader is capable of judging, by the aggregate of these immense charges, on the state and condition of France; and the system of public economy adopted in that nation. These articles of account produced no inquiry or discussion in the National Assembly.
THE advocates for this Revolution, not satisfied with exaggerating the vices of their ancient government, strike at the fame of their country itself by painting almost all that could have attracted the attention of strangers, I mean their nobility and their clergy, as objects of horror. If this were only a libel, there had not been much in it. But it has practical consequences. Had your nobility and gentry, who formed the great body of your landed men and the whole of your military officers, resembled those of Germany at the period when the Hansetowns were necessitated to confederate against the nobles in defense of their property; had they been like the Orsini and Vitelli in Italy, who used to sally from their fortified dens to rob the trader and traveller; had they been such as the Mamelukes in Egypt or the Nayres on the coast of Malabar, I do admit that too critical an inquiry might not be advisable into the means of freeing the world from such a nuisance. The statues of Equity and Mercy might be veiled for a moment. The tenderest minds, confounded with the dreadful exigency in which morality submits to the suspension of its own rules in favor of its own principles, might turn aside whilst fraud and violence were accomplishing the destruction of a pretended nobility which disgraced, whilst it persecuted, human nature. The persons most abhorrent from blood, and treason, and arbitrary confiscation might remain silent spectators of this civil war between the vices.
But did the privileged nobility who met under the king's precept at Versailles, in 1789, or their constituents, deserve to be looked on as the Nayres or Mamelukes of this age, or as the Orsini and Vitelli of ancient times? If I had then asked the question I should have passed for a madman. What have they since done that they were to be driven into exile, that their persons should be hunted about, mangled, and tortured, their families dispersed, their houses laid in ashes, and that their order should be abolished and the memory of it, if possible, extinguished by ordaining them to change the very names by which they were usually known? Read their instructions to their representatives. They breathe the spirit of liberty as warmly and they recommend reformation as strongly as any other order. Their privileges relative to contribution were voluntarily surrendered, as the king, from the beginning, surrendered all pretense to a right of taxation. Upon a free constitution there was but one opinion in France. The absolute monarchy was at an end. It breathed its last, without a groan, without struggle, without convulsion. All the struggle, all the dissension arose afterwards upon the preference of a despotic democracy to a government of reciprocal control. The triumph of the victorious party was over the principles of a British constitution.
I have observed the affectation which for many years past has prevailed in Paris, even to a degree perfectly childish, of idolizing the memory of your Henry the Fourth. If anything could put one out of humor with that ornament to the kingly character, it would be this overdone style of insidious panegyric. The persons who have worked this engine the most busily are those who have ended their panegyrics in dethroning his successor and descendant, a man as good-natured, at the least, as Henry the Fourth, altogether as fond of his people, and who has done infinitely more to correct the ancient vices of the state than that great monarch did, or we are sure he ever meant to do. Well it is for his panegyrists that they have not him to deal with. For Henry of Navarre was a resolute, active, and politic prince. He possessed, indeed, great humanity and mildness, but a humanity and mildness that never stood in the way of his interests. He never sought to be loved without putting himself first in a condition to be feared. He used soft language with determined conduct. He asserted and maintained his authority in the gross, and distributed his acts of concession only in the detail. He spent the income of his prerogative nobly, but he took care not to break in upon the capital, never abandoning for a moment any of the claims which he made under the fundamental laws, nor sparing to shed the blood of those who opposed him, often in the field, sometimes upon the scaffold. Because he knew how to make his virtues respected by the ungrateful, he has merited the praises of those whom, if they had lived in his time, he would have shut up in the Bastille and brought to punishment along with the regicides whom he hanged after he had famished Paris into a surrender.
If these panegyrists are in earnest in their admiration of Henry the Fourth, they must remember that they cannot think more highly of him than he did of the noblesse of France, whose virtue, honor, courage, patriotism, and loyalty were his constant theme.
But the nobility of France are degenerated since the days of Henry the Fourth. This is possible. But it is more than I can believe to be true in any great degree. I do not pretend to know France as correctly as some others, but I have endeavored through my whole life to make myself acquainted with human nature, otherwise I should be unfit to take even my humble part in the service of mankind. In that study I could not pass by a vast portion of our nature as it appeared modified in a country but twenty-four miles from the shore of this island. On my best observation, compared with my best inquiries, I found your nobility for the greater part composed of men of high spirit and of a delicate sense of honor, both with regard to themselves individually and with regard to their whole corps, over whom they kept, beyond what is common in other countries, a censorial eye. They were tolerably well bred, very officious, humane, and hospitable; in their conversation frank and open; with a good military tone, and reasonably tinctured with literature, particularly of the authors in their own language. Many had pretensions far above this description. I speak of those who were generally met with.
As to their behavior to the inferior classes, they appeared to me to comport themselves toward them with good nature and with something more nearly approaching to familiarity than is generally practiced with us in the intercourse between the higher and lower ranks of life. To strike any person, even in the most abject condition, was a thing in a manner unknown and would be highly disgraceful. Instances of other ill-treatment of the humble part of the community were rare; and as to attacks made upon the property or the personal liberty of the commons, I never heard of any whatsoever from them; nor, whilst the laws were in vigor under the ancient government, would such tyranny in subjects have been permitted. As men of landed estates, I had no fault to find with their conduct, though much to reprehend and much to wish changed in many of the old tenures. Where the letting of their land was by rent, I could not discover that their agreements with their farmers were oppressive; nor when they were in partnership with the farmer, as often was the case, have I heard that they had taken the lion's share. The proportions seemed not inequitable. There might be exceptions, but certainly they were exceptions only. I have no reason to believe that in these respects the landed noblesse of France were worse than the landed gentry of this country, certainly in no respect more vexatious than the landholders, not noble, of their own nation. In cities the nobility had no manner of power, in the country very little. You know, Sir, that much of the civil government, and the police in the most essential parts, was not in the hands of that nobility which presents itself first to our consideration. The revenue, the system and collection of which were the most grievous parts of the French government, was not administered by the men of the sword, nor were they answerable for the vices of its principle or the vexations, where any such existed, in its management.
Denying, as I am well warranted to do, that the nobility had any considerable share in the oppression of the people in cases in which real oppression existed, I am ready to admit that they were not without considerable faults and errors. A foolish imitation of the worst part of the manners of England, which impaired their natural character without substituting in its place what, perhaps, they meant to copy, has certainly rendered them worse than formerly they were. Habitual dissoluteness of manners, continued beyond the pardonable period of life, was more common amongst them than it is with us; and it reigned with the less hope of remedy, though possibly with something of less mischief by being covered with more exterior decorum. They countenanced too much that licentious philosophy which has helped to bring on their ruin. There was another error amongst them more fatal. Those of the commons who approached to or exceeded many of the nobility in point of wealth were not fully admitted to the rank and estimation which wealth, in reason and good policy, ought to bestow in every country, though I think not equally with that of other nobility. The two kinds of aristocracy were too punctiliously kept asunder, less so, however, than in Germany and some other nations.
This separation, as I have already taken the liberty of suggesting to you, I conceive to be one principal cause of the destruction of the old nobility. The military, particularly, was too exclusively reserved for men of family. But, after all, this was an error of opinion, which a conflicting opinion would have rectified. A permanent assembly in which the commons had their share of power would soon abolish whatever was too invidious and insulting in these distinctions, and even the faults in the morals of the nobility would have been probably corrected by the greater varieties of occupation and pursuit to which a constitution by orders would have given rise.
All this violent cry against the nobility I take to be a mere work of art. To be honored and even privileged by the laws, opinions, and inveterate usages of our country, growing out of the prejudice of ages, has nothing to provoke horror and indignation in any man. Even to be too tenacious of those privileges is not absolutely a crime. The strong struggle in every individual to preserve possession of what he has found to belong to him and to distinguish him is one of the securities against injustice and despotism implanted in our nature. It operates as an instinct to secure property and to preserve communities in a settled state. What is there to shock in this? Nobility is a graceful ornament to the civil order. It is the Corinthian capital of polished society. Omnes boni nobilitati semper favemus, was the saying of a wise and good man. It is indeed one sign of a liberal and benevolent mind to incline to it with some sort of partial propensity. He feels no ennobling principle in his own heart who wishes to level all the artificial institutions which have been adopted for giving a body to opinion, and permanence to fugitive esteem. It is a sour, malignant, envious disposition, without taste for the reality or for any image or representation of virtue, that sees with joy the unmerited fall of what had long flourished in splendor and in honor. I do not like to see anything destroyed, any void produced in society, any ruin on the face of the land. It was, therefore, with no disappointment or dissatisfaction that my inquiries and observations did not present to me any incorrigible vices in the noblesse of France, or any abuse which could not be removed by a reform very short of abolition. Your noblesse did not deserve punishment; but to degrade is to punish.
IT WAS WITH THE SAME SATISFACTION I found that the result of my inquiry concerning your clergy was not dissimilar. It is no soothing news to my ears that great bodies of men are incurably corrupt. It is not with much credulity I listen to any when they speak evil of those whom they are going to plunder. I rather suspect that vices are feigned or exaggerated when profit is looked for in their punishment. An enemy is a bad witness; a robber is a worse. Vices and abuses there were undoubtedly in that order, and must be. It was an old establishment, and not frequently revised. But I saw no crimes in the individuals that merited confiscation of their substance, nor those cruel insults and degradations, and that unnatural persecution which have been substituted in the place of meliorating regulation.
If there had been any just cause for this new religious persecution, the atheistic libellers, who act as trumpeters to animate the populace to plunder, do not love anybody so much as not to dwell with complacency on the vices of the existing clergy. This they have not done. They find themselves obliged to rake into the histories of former ages (which they have ransacked with a malignant and profligate industry) for every instance of oppression and persecution which has been made by that body or in its favor in order to justify, upon very iniquitous, because very illogical, principles of retaliation, their own persecutions and their own cruelties. After destroying all other genealogies and family distinctions, they invent a sort of pedigree of crimes. It is not very just to chastise men for the offenses of their natural ancestors, but to take the fiction of ancestry in a corporate succession as a ground for punishing men who have no relation to guilty acts, except in names and general descriptions, is a sort of refinement in injustice belonging to the philosophy of this enlightened age. The Assembly punishes men, many, if not most, of whom abhor the violent conduct of ecclesiastics in former times as much as their present persecutors can do, and who would be as loud and as strong in the expression of that sense, if they were not well aware of the purposes for which all this declamation is employed.
Corporate bodies are immortal for the good of the members, but not for their punishment. Nations themselves are such corporations. As well might we in England think of waging inexpiable war upon all Frenchmen for the evils which they have brought upon us in the several periods of our mutual hostilities. You might, on your part, think yourselves justified in falling upon all Englishmen on account of the unparalleled calamities brought on the people of France by the unjust invasions of our Henries and our Edwards. Indeed, we should be mutually justified in this exterminatory war upon each other, full as much as you are in the unprovoked persecution of your present countrymen, on account of the conduct of men of the same name in other times.
We do not draw the moral lessons we might from history. On the contrary, without care it may be used to vitiate our minds and to destroy our happiness. In history a great volume is unrolled for our instruction, drawing the materials of future wisdom from the past errors and infirmities of mankind. It may, in the perversion, serve for a magazine furnishing offensive and defensive weapons for parties in church and state, and supplying the means of keeping alive or reviving dissensions and animosities, and adding fuel to civil fury. History consists for the greater part of the miseries brought upon the world by pride, ambition, avarice, revenge, lust, sedition, hypocrisy, ungoverned zeal, and all the train of disorderly appetites which shake the public with the same
       troublous storms that toss
      The private state, and render life unsweet.
These vices are the causes of those storms. Religion, morals, laws, prerogatives, privileges, liberties, rights of men are the pretexts. The pretexts are always found in some specious appearance of a real good. You would not secure men from tyranny and sedition by rooting out of the mind the principles to which these fraudulent pretexts apply? If you did, you would root out everything that is valuable in the human breast. As these are the pretexts, so the ordinary actors and instruments in great public evils are kings, priests, magistrates, senates, parliaments, national assemblies, judges, and captains. You would not cure the evil by resolving that there should be no more monarchs, nor ministers of state, nor of the gospel; no interpreters of law; no general officers; no public councils. You might change the names. The things in some shape must remain. A certain quantum of power must always exist in the community in some hands and under some appellation. Wise men will apply their remedies to vices, not to names; to the causes of evil which are permanent, not to the occasional organs by which they act, and the transitory modes in which they appear. Otherwise you will be wise historically, a fool in practice. Seldom have two ages the same fashion in their pretexts and the same modes of mischief. Wickedness is a little more inventive. Whilst you are discussing fashion, the fashion is gone by. The very same vice assumes a new body. The spirit transmigrates, and, far from losing its principle of life by the change of its appearance, it is renovated in its new organs with a fresh vigor of a juvenile activity. It walks abroad, it continues its ravages, whilst you are gibbeting the carcass or demolishing the tomb. You are terrifying yourselves with ghosts and apparitions, whilst your house is the haunt of robbers. It is thus with all those who, attending only to the shell and husk of history, think they are waging war with intolerance, pride, and cruelty, whilst, under color of abhorring the ill principles of antiquated parties, they are authorizing and feeding the same odious vices in different factions, and perhaps in worse.
Your citizens of Paris formerly had lent themselves as the ready instruments to slaughter the followers of Calvin, at the infamous massacre of St. Bartholomew. What should we say to those who could think of retaliating on the Parisians of this day the abominations and horrors of that time? They are indeed brought to abhor that massacre. Ferocious as they are, it is not difficult to make them dislike it, because the politicians and fashionable teachers have no interest in giving their passions exactly the same direction. Still, however, they find it their interest to keep the same savage dispositions alive. It was but the other day that they caused this very massacre to be acted on the stage for the diversion of the descendants of those who committed it. In this tragic farce they produced the cardinal of Lorraine in his robes of function, ordering general slaughter. Was this spectacle intended to make the Parisians abhor persecution and loathe the effusion of blood? — No; it was to teach them to persecute their own pastors; it was to excite them, by raising a disgust and horror of their clergy, to an alacrity in hunting down to destruction an order which, if it ought to exist at all, ought to exist not only in safety, but in reverence. It was to stimulate their cannibal appetites (which one would think had been gorged sufficiently) by variety and seasoning; and to quicken them to an alertness in new murders and massacres, if it should suit the purpose of the Guises of the day. An assembly, in which sat a multitude of priests and prelates, was obliged to suffer this indignity at its door. The author was not sent to the galleys, nor the players to the house of correction. Not long after this exhibition, those players came forward to the Assembly to claim the rites of that very religion which they had dared to expose, and to show their prostituted faces in the senate, whilst the archbishop of Paris, whose function was known to his people only by his prayers and benedictions, and his wealth only by his alms, is forced to abandon his house and to fly from his flock (as from ravenous wolves) because, truly, in the sixteenth century, the cardinal of Lorraine was a rebel and a murderer. 
Such is the effect of the perversion of history by those who, for the same nefarious purposes, have perverted every other part of learning. But those who will stand upon that elevation of reason which places centuries under our eye and brings things to the true point of comparison, which obscures little names and effaces the colors of little parties, and to which nothing can ascend but the spirit and moral quality of human actions, will say to the teachers of the Palais Royal: The cardinal of Lorraine was the murderer of the sixteenth century, you have the glory of being the murderers in the eighteenth, and this is the only difference between you. But history in the nineteenth century, better understood and better employed, will, I trust, teach a civilized posterity to abhor the misdeeds of both these barbarous ages. It will teach future priests and magistrates not to retaliate upon the speculative and inactive atheists of future times the enormities committed by the present practical zealots and furious fanatics of that wretched error, which, in its quiescent state, is more than punished whenever it is embraced. It will teach posterity not to make war upon either religion or philosophy for the abuse which the hypocrites of both have made of the two most valuable blessings conferred upon us by the bounty of the universal Patron, who in all things eminently favors and protects the race of man.
If your clergy, or any clergy, should show themselves vicious beyond the fair bounds allowed to human infirmity, and to those professional faults which can hardly be separated from professional virtues, though their vices never can countenance the exercise of oppression, I do admit that they would naturally have the effect of abating very much of our indignation against the tyrants who exceed measure and justice in their punishment. I can allow in clergymen, through all their divisions, some tenaciousness of their own opinion, some overflowings of zeal for its propagation, some predilection to their own state and office, some attachment to the interests of their own corps, some preference to those who listen with docility to their doctrines, beyond those who scorn and deride them. I allow all this, because I am a man who has to deal with men, and who would not, through a violence of toleration, run into the greatest of all intolerance. I must bear with infirmities until they fester into crimes.
Undoubtedly, the natural progress of the passions, from frailty to vice, ought to be prevented by a watchful eye and a firm hand. But is it true that the body of your clergy had passed those limits of a just allowance? From the general style of your late publications of all sorts one would be led to believe that your clergy in France were a sort of monsters, a horrible composition of superstition, ignorance, sloth, fraud, avarice, and tyranny. But is this true? Is it true that the lapse of time, the cessation of conflicting interests, the woeful experience of the evils resulting from party rage have had no sort of influence gradually to meliorate their minds? Is it true that they were daily renewing invasions on the civil power, troubling the domestic quiet of their country, and rendering the operations of its government feeble and precarious? Is it true that the clergy of our times have pressed down the laity with an iron hand and were in all places lighting up the fires of a savage persecution? Did they by every fraud endeavor to increase their estates? Did they use to exceed the due demands on estates that were their own? Or, rigidly screwing up right into wrong, did they convert a legal claim into a vexatious extortion? When not possessed of power, were they filled with the vices of those who envy it? Were they inflamed with a violent, litigious spirit of controversy? Goaded on with the ambition of intellectual sovereignty, were they ready to fly in the face of all magistracy, to fire churches, to massacre the priests of other descriptions, to pull down altars, and to make their way over the ruins of subverted governments to an empire of doctrine, sometimes flattering, sometimes forcing the consciences of men from the jurisdiction of public institutions into a submission of their personal authority, beginning with a claim of liberty and ending with an abuse of power?
These, or some of these, were the vices objected, and not wholly without foundation, to several of the churchmen of former times who belonged to the two great parties which then divided and distracted Europe.
If there was in France, as in other countries there visibly is, a great abatement rather than any increase of these vices, instead of loading the present clergy with the crimes of other men and the odious character of other times, in common equity they ought to be praised, encouraged, and supported in their departure from a spirit which disgraced their predecessors, and for having assumed a temper of mind and manners more suitable to their sacred function.
When my occasions took me into France, toward the close of the late reign, the clergy, under all their forms, engaged a considerable part of my curiosity. So far from finding (except from one set of men, not then very numerous, though very active) the complaints and discontents against that body, which some publications had given me reason to expect, I perceived little or no public or private uneasiness on their account. On further examination, I found the clergy, in general, persons of moderate minds and decorous manners; I include the seculars and the regulars of both sexes. I had not the good fortune to know a great many of the parochial clergy, but in general I received a perfectly good account of their morals and of their attention to their duties. With some of the higher clergy I had a personal acquaintance, and of the rest in that class a very good means of information. They were, almost all of them, persons of noble birth. They resembled others of their own rank; and where there was any difference, it was in their favor. They were more fully educated than the military noblesse, so as by no means to disgrace their profession by ignorance or by want of fitness for the exercise of their authority. They seemed to me, beyond the clerical character, liberal and open, with the hearts of gentlemen and men of honor, neither insolent nor servile in their manners and conduct. They seemed to me rather a superior class, a set of men amongst whom you would not be surprised to find a Fenelon. I saw among the clergy in Paris (many of the description are not to be met with anywhere) men of great learning and candor; and I had reason to believe that this description was not confined to Paris. What I found in other places I know was accidental, and therefore to be presumed a fair example. I spent a few days in a provincial town where, in the absence of the bishop, I passed my evenings with three clergymen, his vicars-general, persons who would have done honor to any church. They were all well informed; two of them of deep, general, and extensive erudition, ancient and modern, oriental and western, particularly in their own profession. They had a more extensive knowledge of our English divines than I expected, and they entered into the genius of those writers with a critical accuracy. One of these gentlemen is since dead, the Abbe Morangis. I pay this tribute, without reluctance, to the memory of that noble, reverend, learned, and excellent person; and I should do the same with equal cheerfulness to the merits of the others who, I believe, are still living, if I did not fear to hurt those whom I am unable to serve.
Some of these ecclesiastics of rank are by all titles persons deserving of general respect. They are deserving of gratitude from me and from many English. If this letter should ever come into their hands, I hope they will believe there are those of our nation who feel for their unmerited fall and for the cruel confiscation of their fortunes with no common sensibility. What I say of them is a testimony, as far as one feeble voice can go, which I owe to truth. Whenever the question of this unnatural persecution is concerned, I will pay it. No one shall prevent me from being just and grateful. The time is fitted for the duty, and it is particularly becoming to show our justice and gratitude when those who have deserved well of us and of mankind are laboring under popular obloquy and the persecutions of oppressive power.
You had before your Revolution about a hundred and twenty bishops. A few of them were men of eminent sanctity, and charity without limit. When we talk of the heroic, of course we talk of rare virtue. I believe the instances of eminent depravity may be as rare amongst them as those of transcendent goodness. Examples of avarice and of licentiousness may be picked out, I do not question it, by those who delight in the investigation which leads to such discoveries. A man as old as I am will not be astonished that several, in every description, do not lead that perfect life of self-denial, with regard to wealth or to pleasure, which is wished for by all, by some expected, but by none exacted with more rigor than by those who are the most attentive to their own interests, or the most indulgent to their own passions. When I was in France, I am certain that the number of vicious prelates was not great. Certain individuals among them, not distinguishable for the regularity of their lives, made some amends for their want of the severe virtues in their possession of the liberal, and were endowed with qualities which made them useful in the church and state. I am told that, with few exceptions, Louis the Sixteenth had been more attentive to character, in his promotions to that rank, than his immediate predecessor; and I believe (as some spirit of reform has prevailed through the whole reign) that it may be true. But the present ruling power has shown a disposition only to plunder the church. It has punished all prelates, which is to favor the vicious, at least in point of reputation. It has made a degrading pensionary establishment to which no man of liberal ideas or liberal condition will destine his children. It must settle into the lowest classes of the people. As with you the inferior clergy are not numerous enough for their duties; as these duties are, beyond measure, minute and toilsome; as you have left no middle classes of clergy at their ease, in future nothing of science or erudition can exist in the Gallican church. To complete the project without the least attention to the rights of patrons, the Assembly has provided in future an elective clergy, an arrangement which will drive out of the clerical profession all men of sobriety, all who can pretend to independence in their function or their conduct, and which will throw the whole direction of the public mind into the hands of a set of licentious, bold, crafty, factious, flattering wretches, of such condition and such habits of life as will make their contemptible pensions (in comparison of which the stipend of an exciseman is lucrative and honorable) an object of low and illiberal intrigue. Those officers whom they still call bishops are to be elected to a provision comparatively mean, through the same arts (that is, electioneering arts), by men of all religious tenets that are known or can be invented. The new lawgivers have not ascertained anything whatsoever concerning their qualifications relative either to doctrine or to morals, no more than they have done with regard to the subordinate clergy; nor does it appear but that both the higher and the lower may, at their discretion, practice or preach any mode of religion or irreligion that they please. I do not yet see what the jurisdiction of bishops over their subordinates is to be, or whether they are to have any jurisdiction at all.
In short, Sir, it seems to me that this new ecclesiastical establishment is intended only to be temporary and preparatory to the utter abolition, under any of its forms, of the Christian religion, whenever the minds of men are prepared for this last stroke against it, by the accomplishment of the plan for bringing its ministers into universal contempt. They who will not believe that the philosophical fanatics who guide in these matters have long entertained such a design are utterly ignorant of their character and proceedings. These enthusiasts do not scruple to avow their opinion that a state can subsist without any religion better than with one, and that they are able to supply the place of any good which may be in it by a project of their own — namely, by a sort of eduction they have imagined, founded in a knowledge of the physical wants of men, progressively carried to an enlightened self-interest which, when well understood, they tell us, will identify with an interest more enlarged and public. The scheme of this education has been long known. Of late they distinguish it (as they have got an entirely new nomenclature of technical terms) by the name of a Civic Education.
I hope their partisans in England (to whom I rather attribute very inconsiderate conduct than the ultimate object in this detestable design) will succeed neither in the pillage of the ecclesiastics, nor in the introduction of a principle of popular election to our bishoprics and parochial cures. This, in the present condition of the world, would be the last corruption of the church, the utter ruin of the clerical character, the most dangerous shock that the state ever received through a misunderstood arrangement of religion. I know well enough that the bishoprics and cures under kingly and seignioral patronage, as now they are in England, and as they have been lately in France, are sometimes acquired by unworthy methods; but the other mode of ecclesiastical canvass subjects them infinitely more surely and more generally to all the evil arts of low ambition, which, operating on and through greater numbers, will produce mischief in proportion.
Those of you who have robbed the clergy think that they shall easily reconcile their conduct to all Protestant nations, because the clergy, whom they have thus plundered, degraded, and given over to mockery and scorn, are of the Roman Catholic, that is, of their own pretended persuasion. I have no doubt that some miserable bigots will be found here, as well as elsewhere, who hate sects and parties different from their own more than they love the substance of religion, and who are more angry with those who differ from them in their particular plans and systems than displeased with those who attack the foundation of our common hope. These men will write and speak on the subject in the manner that is to be expected from their temper and character. Burnet says that when he was in France, in the year 1683, ""the method which carried over the men of the finest parts to Popery was this — they brought themselves to doubt of the whole Christian religion. When that was once done, it seemed a more indifferent thing of what side or form they continued outwardly."" If this was then the ecclesiastical policy of France, it is what they have since but too much reason to repent of. They preferred atheism to a form of religion not agreeable to their ideas. They succeeded in destroying that form; and atheism has succeeded in destroying them. I can readily give credit to Burnet's story, because I have observed too much of a similar spirit (for a little of it is ""much too much"") amongst ourselves. The humor, however, is not general.
THE teachers who reformed our religion in England bore no sort of resemblance to your present reforming doctors in Paris. Perhaps they were (like those whom they opposed) rather more than could be wished under the influence of a party spirit, but they were more sincere believers, men of the most fervent and exalted piety, ready to die (as some of them did die) like true heroes in defense of their particular ideas of Christianity, as they would with equal fortitude, and more cheerfully, for that stock of general truth for the branches of which they contended with their blood. These men would have disavowed with horror those wretches who claimed a fellowship with them upon no other titles than those of their having pillaged the persons with whom they maintained controversies, and their having despised the common religion for the purity of which they exerted themselves with a zeal which unequivocally bespoke their highest reverence for the substance of that system which they wished to reform. Many of their descendants have retained the same zeal, but (as less engaged in conflict) with more moderation. They do not forget that justice and mercy are substantial parts of religion. Impious men do not recommend themselves to their communion by iniquity and cruelty toward any description of their fellow creatures.
We hear these new teachers continually boasting of their spirit of toleration. That those persons should tolerate all opinions, who think none to be of estimation, is a matter of small merit. Equal neglect is not impartial kindness. The species of benevolence which arises from contempt is no true charity. There are in England abundance of men who tolerate in the true spirit of toleration. They think the dogmas of religion, though in different degrees, are all of moment, and that amongst them there is, as amongst all things of value, a just ground of preference. They favor, therefore, and they tolerate. They tolerate, not because they despise opinions, but because they respect justice. They would reverently and affectionately protect all religions because they love and venerate the great principle upon which they all agree, and the great object to which they are all directed. They begin more and more plainly to discern that we have all a common cause, as against a common enemy. They will not be so misled by the spirit of faction as not to distinguish what is done in favor of their subdivision from those acts of hostility which, through some particular description, are aimed at the whole corps, in which they themselves, under another denomination, are included. It is impossible for me to say what may be the character of every description of men amongst us. But I speak for the greater part; and for them, I must tell you that sacrilege is no part of their doctrine of good works; that, so far from calling you into their fellowship on such title, if your professors are admitted to their communion, they must carefully conceal their doctrine of the lawfulness of the prescription of innocent men; and that they must make restitution of all stolen goods whatsoever. Till then they are none of ours.
You may suppose that we do not approve your confiscation of the revenues of bishops, and deans, and chapters, and parochial clergy possessing independent estates arising from land, because we have the same sort of establishment in England. That objection, you will say, cannot hold as to the confiscation of the goods of monks and nuns and the abolition of their order. It is true that this particular part of your general confiscation does not affect England, as a precedent in point; but the reason implies, and it goes a great way. The Long Parliament confiscated the lands of deans and chapters in England on the same ideas upon which your Assembly set to sale the lands of the monastic orders. But it is in the principle of injustice that the danger lies, and not in the description of persons on whom it is first exercised. I see, in a country very near us, a course of policy pursued which sets justice, the common concern of mankind, at defiance. With the National Assembly of France possession is nothing, law and usage are nothing. I see the National Assembly openly reprobate the doctrine of prescription, which one of the greatest of their own lawyers tells us, with great truth, is a part of the law of nature. He tells us that the positive ascertainment of its limits, and its security from invasion, were among the causes for which civil society itself has been instituted. If prescription be once shaken, no species of property is secure when it once becomes an object large enough to tempt the cupidity of indigent power. I see a practice perfectly correspondent to their contempt of this great fundamental part of natural law. I see the confiscators begin with bishops and chapters, and monasteries, but I do not see them end there. I see the princes of the blood, who by the oldest usages of that kingdom held large landed estates, (hardly with the compliment of a debate) deprived of their possessions and, in lieu of their stable, independent property, reduced to the hope of some precarious, charitable pension at the pleasure of an assembly which of course will pay little regard to the rights of pensioners at pleasure when it despises those of legal proprietors. Flushed with the insolence of their first inglorious victories, and pressed by the distresses caused by their lust of unhallowed lucre, disappointed but not discouraged, they have at length ventured completely to subvert all property of all descriptions throughout the extent of a great kingdom. They have compelled all men, in all transactions of commerce, in the disposal of lands, in civil dealing, and through the whole communion of life, to accept as perfect payment and good and lawful tender the symbols of their speculations on a projected sale of their plunder. What vestiges of liberty or property have they left? The tenant right of a cabbage garden, a year's interest in a hovel, the goodwill of an alehouse or a baker's shop, the very shadow of a constructive property, are more ceremoniously treated in our parliament than with you the oldest and most valuable landed possessions, in the hands of the most respectable personages, or than the whole body of the monied and commercial interest of your country. We entertain a high opinion of the legislative authority, but we have never dreamt that parliaments had any right whatever to violate property, to overrule prescription, or to force a currency of their own fiction in the place of that which is real and recognized by the law of nations. But you, who began with refusing to submit to the most moderate restraints, have ended by establishing an unheard-of despotism. I find the ground upon which your confiscators go is this: that, indeed, their proceedings could not be supported in a court of justice, but that the rules of prescription cannot bind a legislative assembly. So that this legislative assembly of a free nation sits, not for the security, but for the destruction, of property, and not of property only, but of every rule and maxim which can give it stability, and of those instruments which can alone give it circulation.
When the Anabaptists of Munster, in the sixteenth century, had filled Germany with confusion by their system of leveling and their wild opinions concerning property, to what country in Europe did not the progress of their fury furnish just cause of alarm?
Of all things, wisdom is the most terrified with epidemical fanaticism, because of all enemies it is that against which she is the least able to furnish any kind of resource. We cannot be ignorant of the spirit of atheistical fanaticism that is inspired by a multitude of writings dispersed with incredible assiduity and expense, and by sermons delivered in all the streets and places of public resort in Paris. These writings and sermons have filled the populace with a black and savage atrocity of mind, which supersedes in them the common feelings of nature as well as all sentiments of morality and religion, insomuch that these wretches are induced to bear with a sullen patience the intolerable distresses brought upon them by the violent convulsions and permutations that have been made in property.The spirit of proselytism attends this spirit of fanaticism. They have societies to cabal and correspond at home and abroad for the propagation of their tenets. The republic of Berne, one of the happiest, the most prosperous, and the best governed countries upon earth, is one of the great objects at the destruction of which they aim. I am told they have in some measure succeeded in sowing there the seeds of discontent. They are busy throughout Germany. Spain and Italy have not been untried. England is not left out of the comprehensive scheme of their malignant charity; and in England we find those who stretch out their arms to them, who recommend their example from more than one pulpit, and who choose in more than one periodical meeting publicly to correspond with them, to applaud them, and to hold them up as objects for imitation; who receive from them tokens of confraternity, and standards consecrated amidst their rites and mysteries;  who suggest to them leagues of perpetual amity, at the very time when the power to which our constitution has exclusively delegated the federative capacity of this kingdom may find it expedient to make war upon them.
It is not the confiscation of our church property from this example in France that I dread, though I think this would be no trifling evil. The great source of my solicitude is, lest it should ever be considered in England as the policy of a state to seek a resource in confiscations of any kind, or that any one description of citizens should be brought to regard any of the others as their proper prey. Nations are wading deeper and deeper into an ocean of boundless debt. Public debts, which at first were a security to governments by interesting many in the public tranquillity, are likely in their excess to become the means of their subversion. If governments provide for these debts by heavy impositions, they perish by becoming odious to the people. If they do not provide for them, they will be undone by the efforts of the most dangerous of all parties — I mean an extensive, discontented monied interest, injured and not destroyed. The men who compose this interest look for their security, in the first instance, to the fidelity of government; in the second, to its power. If they find the old governments effete, worn out, and with their springs relaxed, so as not to be of sufficient vigor for their purposes, they may seek new ones that shall be possessed of more energy; and this energy will be derived, not from an acquisition of resources, but from a contempt of justice. Revolutions are favorable to confiscation; and it is impossible to know under what obnoxious names the next confiscations will be authorized. I am sure that the principles predominant in France extend to very many persons and descriptions of persons, in all countries, who think their innoxious indolence their security. This kind of innocence in proprietors may be argued into inutility; and inutility into an unfitness for their estates. Many parts of Europe are in open disorder. In many others there is a hollow murmuring under ground; a confused movement is felt that threatens a general earthquake in the political world. Already confederacies and correspondencies of the most extraordinary nature are forming in several countries.  In such a state of things we ought to hold ourselves upon our guard. In all mutations (if mutations must be) the circumstance which will serve most to blunt the edge of their mischief and to promote what good may be in them is that they should find us with our minds tenacious of justice and tender of property.
But it will be argued that this confiscation in France ought not to alarm other nations. They say it is not made from wanton rapacity, that it is a great measure of national policy adopted to remove an extensive, inveterate, superstitious mischief. It is with the greatest difficulty that I am able to separate policy from justice. Justice itself is the great standing policy of civil society, and any eminent departure from it, under any circumstances, lies under the suspicion of being no policy at all.
When men are encouraged to go into a certain mode of life by the existing laws, and protected in that mode as in a lawful occupation; when they have accommodated all their ideas and all their habits to it; when the law had long made their adherence to its rules a ground of reputation, and their departure from them a ground of disgrace and even of penalty — I am sure it is unjust in legislature, by an arbitrary act, to offer a sudden violence to their minds and their feelings, forcibly to degrade them from their state and condition and to stigmatize with shame and infamy that character and those customs which before had been made the measure of their happiness and honor. If to this be added an expulsion from their habitations and a confiscation of all their goods, I am not sagacious enough to discover how this despotic sport, made of the feelings, consciences, prejudices, and properties of men, can be discriminated from the rankest tyranny.
If the injustice of the course pursued in France be clear, the policy of the measure, that is, the public benefit to be expected from it, ought to be at least as evident and at least as important. To a man who acts under the influence of no passion, who has nothing in view in his projects but the public good, a great difference will immediately strike him between what policy would dictate on the original introduction of such institutions and on a question of their total abolition, where they have cast their roots wide and deep, and where, by long habit, things more valuable than themselves are so adapted to them, and in a manner interwoven with them, that the one cannot be destroyed without notably impairing the other. He might be embarrassed if the case were really such as sophisters represent it in their paltry style of debating. But in this, as in most questions of state, there is a middle. There is something else than the mere alternative of absolute destruction or unreformed existence. Spartam nactus es; hanc exorna. This is, in my opinion, a rule of profound sense and ought never to depart from the mind of an honest reformer. I cannot conceive how any man can have brought himself to that pitch of presumption to consider his country as nothing but carte blanche — upon which he may scribble whatever he pleases. A man full of warm, speculative benevolence may wish his society otherwise constituted than he finds it, but a good patriot and a true politician always considers how he shall make the most of the existing materials of his country. A disposition to preserve and an ability to improve, taken together, would be my standard of a statesman. Everything else is vulgar in the conception, perilous in the execution.
There are moments in the fortune of states when particular men are called to make improvements by great mental exertion. In those moments, even when they seem to enjoy the confidence of their prince and country, and to be invested with full authority, they have not always apt instruments. A politician, to do great things, looks for a power what our workmen call a purchase; and if he finds that power, in politics as in mechanics, he cannot be at a loss to apply it. In the monastic institutions, in my opinion, was found a great power for the mechanism of politic benevolence. There were revenues with a public direction; there were men wholly set apart and dedicated to public purposes, without any other than public ties and public principles; men without the possibility of converting the estate of the community into a private fortune; men denied to self-interests, whose avarice is for some community; men to whom personal poverty is honor, and implicit obedience stands in the place of freedom. In vain shall a man look to the possibility of making such things when he wants them. The winds blow as they list. These institutions are the products of enthusiasm; they are the instruments of wisdom. Wisdom cannot create materials; they are the gifts of nature or of chance; her pride is in the use. The perennial existence of bodies corporate and their fortunes are things particularly suited to a man who has long views; who meditates designs that require time in fashioning, and which propose duration when they are accomplished. He is not deserving to rank high, or even to be mentioned in the order of great statesmen, who, having obtained the command and direction of such a power as existed in the wealth, the discipline, and the habits of such corporations, as those which you have rashly destroyed, cannot find any way of converting it to the great and lasting benefit of his country. On the view of this subject, a thousand uses suggest themselves to a contriving mind. To destroy any power growing wild from the rank productive force of the human mind is almost tantamount, in the moral world, to the destruction of the apparently active properties of bodies in the material. It would be like the attempt to destroy (if it were in our competence to destroy) the expansive force of fixed air in nitre, or the power of steam, or of electricity, or of magnetism. These energies always existed in nature, and they were always discernible. They seemed, some of them unserviceable, some noxious, some no better than a sport to children, until contemplative ability, combining with practic skill, tamed their wild nature, subdued them to use, and rendered them at once the most powerful and the most tractable agents in subservience to the great views and designs of men. Did fifty thousand persons whose mental and whose bodily labor you might direct, and so many hundred thousand a year of a revenue which was neither lazy nor superstitious, appear too big for your abilities to wield? Had you no way of using them but by converting monks into pensioners? Had you no way of turning the revenue to account but through the improvident resource of a spendthrift sale? If you were thus destitute of mental funds, the proceeding is in its natural course. Your politicians do not understand their trade; and therefore they sell their tools.
But the institutions savor of superstition in their very principle, and they nourish it by a permanent and standing influence. This I do not mean to dispute, but this ought not to hinder you from deriving from superstition itself any resources which may thence be furnished for the public advantage. You derive benefits from many dispositions and many passions of the human mind which are of as doubtful a color, in the moral eye, as superstition itself. It was your business to correct and mitigate everything which was noxious in this passion, as in all the passions. But is superstition the greatest of all possible vices? In its possible excess I think it becomes a very great evil. It is, however, a moral subject and, of course, admits of all degrees and all modifications. Superstition is the religion of feeble minds; and they must be tolerated in an intermixture of it, in some trifling or some enthusiastic shape or other, else you will deprive weak minds of a resource found necessary to the strongest. The body of all true religion consists, to be sure, in obedience to the will of the Sovereign of the world, in a confidence in his declarations, and in imitation of his perfections. The rest is our own. It may be prejudicial to the great end; it may be auxiliary. Wise men, who as such are not admirers (not admirers at least of the Munera Terrae), are not violently attached to these things, nor do they violently hate them. Wisdom is not the most severe corrector of folly. They are the rival follies which mutually wage so unrelenting a war, and which make so cruel a use of their advantages as they can happen to engage the immoderate vulgar, on the one side or the other, in their quarrels. Prudence would be neuter, but if, in the contention between fond attachment and fierce antipathy concerning things in their nature not made to produce such heats, a prudent man were obliged to make a choice of what errors and excesses of enthusiasm he would condemn or bear, perhaps he would think the superstition which builds to be more tolerable than that which demolishes; that which adorns a country, than that which deforms it; that which endows, than that which plunders; that which disposes to mistaken beneficence, than that which stimulates to real injustice; that which leads a man to refuse to himself lawful pleasures, than that which snatches from others the scanty subsistence of their self-denial. Such, I think, is very nearly the state of the question between the ancient founders of monkish superstition and the superstition of the pretended philosophers of the hour.
For the present I postpone all consideration of the supposed public profit of the sale, which however I conceive to be perfectly delusive. I shall here only consider it as a transfer of property. On the policy of that transfer I shall trouble you with a few thoughts.
In every prosperous community something more is produced than goes to the immediate support of the producer. This surplus forms the income of the landed capitalist. It will be spent by a proprietor who does not labor. But this idleness is itself the spring of labor; this repose the spur to industry. The only concern of the state is that the capital taken in rent from the land should be returned again to the industry from whence it came, and that its expenditure should be with the least possible detriment to the morals of those who expend it, and to those of the people to whom it is returned.
In all the views of receipt, expenditure, and personal employment, a sober legislator would carefully compare the possessor whom he was recommended to expel with the stranger who was proposed to fill his place. Before the inconveniences are incurred which must attend all violent revolutions in property through extensive confiscation, we ought to have some rational assurance that the purchasers of the confiscated property will be in a considerable degree more laborious, more virtuous, more sober, less disposed to extort an unreasonable proportion of the gains of the laborer, or to consume on themselves a larger share than is fit for the measure of an individual; or that they should be qualified to dispense the surplus in a more steady and equal mode, so as to answer the purposes of a politic expenditure, than the old possessors, call those possessors bishops, or canons, or commendatory abbots, or monks, or what you please. The monks are lazy. Be it so. Suppose them no otherwise employed than by singing in the choir. They are as usefully employed as those who neither sing nor say; as usefully even as those who sing upon the stage. They are as usefully employed as if they worked from dawn to dark in the innumerable servile, degrading, unseemly, unmanly, and often most unwholesome and pestiferous occupations to which by the social economy so many wretches are inevitably doomed. If it were not generally pernicious to disturb the natural course of things and to impede in any degree the great wheel of circulation which is turned by the strangely-directed labor of these unhappy people, I should be infinitely more inclined forcibly to rescue them from their miserable industry than violently to disturb the tranquil repose of monastic quietude. Humanity, and perhaps policy, might better justify me in the one than in the other. It is a subject on which I have often reflected, and never reflected without feeling from it. I am sure that no consideration, except the necessity of submitting to the yoke of luxury and the despotism of fancy, who in their own imperious way will distribute the surplus product of the soil, can justify the toleration of such trades and employments in a well-regulated state. But for this purpose of distribution, it seems to me that the idle expenses of monks are quite as well directed as the idle expenses of us lay-loiterers.
When the advantages of the possession and of the project are on a par, there is no motive for a change. But in the present case, perhaps, they are not upon a par, and the difference is in favor of the possession. It does not appear to me that the expenses of those whom you are going to expel do in fact take a course so directly and so generally leading to vitiate and degrade and render miserable those through whom they pass as the expenses of those favorites whom you are intruding into their houses. Why should the expenditure of a great landed property, which is a dispersion of the surplus product of the soil, appear intolerable to you or to me when it takes its course through the accumulation of vast libraries, which are the history of the force and weakness of the human mind; through great collections of ancient records, medals, and coins, which attest and explain laws and customs; through paintings and statues that, by imitating nature, seem to extend the limits of creation; through grand monuments of the dead, which continue the regards and connections of life beyond the grave; through collections of the specimens of nature which become a representative assembly of all the classes and families of the world that by disposition facilitate and, by exciting curiosity, open the avenues to science? If by great permanent establishments all these objects of expense are better secured from the inconstant sport of personal caprice and personal extravagance, are they worse than if the same tastes prevailed in scattered individuals? Does not the sweat of the mason and carpenter, who toil in order to partake of the sweat of the peasant, flow as pleasantly and as salubriously in the construction and repair of the majestic edifices of religion as in the painted booths and sordid sties of vice and luxury; as honorably and as profitably in repairing those sacred works which grow hoary with innumerable years as on the momentary receptacles of transient voluptuousness; in opera houses, and brothels, and gaming houses, and clubhouses, and obelisks in the Champ de Mars? Is the surplus product of the olive and the vine worse employed in the frugal sustenance of persons whom the fictions of a pious imagination raise to dignity by construing in the service of
God, than in pampering the innumerable multitude of those who are degraded by being made useless domestics, subservient to the pride of man? Are the decorations of temples an expenditure less worthy a wise man than ribbons, and laces, and national cockades, and petit maisons, and petit soupers, and all the innumerable fopperies and follies in which opulence sports away the burden of its superfluity?
We tolerate even these, not from love of them, but for fear of worse. We tolerate them because property and liberty, to a degree, require that toleration. But why proscribe the other, and surely, in every point of view, the more laudable, use of estates? Why, through the violation of all property, through an outrage upon every principle of liberty, forcibly carry them from the better to the worse?
This comparison between the new individuals and the old corps is made upon a supposition that no reform could be made in the latter. But in a question of reformation I always consider corporate bodies, whether sole or consisting of many, to be much more susceptible of a public direction by the power of the state, in the use of their property and in the regulation of modes and habits of life in their members, than private citizens ever can be or, perhaps, ought to be; and this seems to me a very material consideration for those who undertake anything which merits the name of a politic enterprise. — So far as to the estates of monasteries.
With regard to the estates possessed by bishops and canons and commendatory abbots, I cannot find out for what reason some landed estates may not be held otherwise than by inheritance. Can any philosophic spoiler undertake to demonstrate the positive or the comparative evil of having a certain, and that too a large, portion of landed property passing in succession through persons whose title to it is, always in theory and often in fact, an eminent degree of piety, morals, and learning — a property which, by its destination, in their turn, and on the score of merit, gives to the noblest families renovation and support, to the lowest the means of dignity and elevation; a property the tenure of which is the performance of some duty (whatever value you may choose to set upon that duty), and the character of whose proprietors demands, at least, an exterior decorum and gravity of manners; who are to exercise a generous but temperate hospitality; part of whose income they are to consider as a trust for charity; and who, even when they fail in their trust, when they slide from their character and degenerate into a mere common secular nobleman or gentleman, are in no respect worse than those who may succeed them in their forfeited possessions? Is it better that estates should be held by those who have no duty than by those who have one? — by those whose character and destination point to virtues than by those who have no rule and direction in the expenditure of their estates but their own will and appetite? Nor are these estates held together in the character or with the evils supposed inherent in mortmain. They pass from hand to hand with a more rapid circulation than any other. No excess is good; and, therefore, too great a proportion of landed property may be held officially for life; but it does not seem to me of material injury to any commonwealth that there should exist some estates that have a chance of being acquired by other means than the previous acquisition of money.
THIS LETTER HAS GROWN to a great length, though it is, indeed, short with regard to the infinite extent of the subject. Various avocations have from time to time called my mind from the subject. I was not sorry to give myself leisure to observe whether, in the proceedings of the National Assembly, I might not find reasons to change or to qualify some of my first sentiments. Everything has confirmed me more strongly in my first opinions. It was my original purpose to take a view of the principles of the National Assembly with regard to the great and fundamental establishments, and to compare the whole of what you have substituted in the place of what you have destroyed with the several members of our British constitution. But this plan is of a greater extent than at first I computed, and I find that you have little desire to take the advantage of any examples. At present I must content myself with some remarks upon your establishments, reserving for another time what I proposed to say concerning the spirit of our British monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy, as practically they exist.
I have taken a view of what has been done by the governing power in France. I have certainly spoken of it with freedom. Those whose principle it is to despise the ancient, permanent sense of mankind and to set up a scheme of society on new principles must naturally expect that such of us who think better of the judgment of the human race than of theirs should consider both them and their devices as men and schemes upon their trial. They must take it for granted that we attend much to their reason, but not at all to their authority. They have not one of the great influencing prejudices of mankind in their favor. They avow their hostility to opinion. Of course, they must expect no support from that influence which, with every other authority, they have deposed from the seat of its jurisdiction.
I can never consider this Assembly as anything else than a voluntary association of men who have availed themselves of circumstances to seize upon the power of the state. They have not the sanction and authority of the character under which they first met. They have assumed another of a very different nature and have completely altered and inverted all the relations in which they originally stood. They do not hold the authority they exercise under any constitutional law of the state. They have departed from the instructions of the people by whom they were sent, which instructions, as the Assembly did not act in virtue of any ancient usage or settled law, were the sole source of their authority. The most considerable of their acts have not been done by great majorities; and in this sort of near divisions, which carry only the constructive authority of the whole, strangers will consider reasons as well as resolutions.
If they had set up this new experimental government as a necessary substitute for an expelled tyranny, mankind would anticipate the time of prescription which, through long usage, mellows into legality governments that were violent in their commencement. All those who have affections which lead them to the conservation of civil order would recognize, even in its cradle, the child as legitimate which has been produced from those principles of cogent expediency to which all just governments owe their birth, and on which they justify their continuance. But they will be late and reluctant in giving any sort of countenance to the operations of a power which has derived its birth from no law and no necessity, but which, on the contrary, has had its origin in those vices and sinister practices by which the social union is often disturbed and sometimes destroyed. This Assembly has hardly a year's prescription. We have their own word for it that they have made a revolution. To make a revolution is a measure which, prima fronte, requires an apology. To make a revolution is to subvert the ancient state of our country; and no common reasons are called for to justify so violent a proceeding. The sense of mankind authorizes us to examine into the mode of acquiring new power, and to criticize on the use that is made of it, with less awe and reverence than that which is usually conceded to a settled and recognized authority.
In obtaining and securing their power the Assembly proceeds upon principles the most opposite to those which appear to direct them in the use of it. An observation on this difference will let us into the true spirit of their conduct. Everything which they have done, or continue to do. in order to obtain and keep their power is by the most common arts. They proceed exactly as their ancestors of ambition have done before them. — Trace them through all their artifices, frauds, and violences, you can find nothing at all that is new. They follow precedents and examples with the punctilious exactness of a pleader. They never depart an iota from the authentic formulas of tyranny and usurpation. But in all the regulations relative to the public good, the spirit has been the very reverse of this. There they commit the whole to the mercy of untried speculations; they abandon the dearest interests of the public to those loose theories to which none of them would choose to trust the slightest of his private concerns. They make this difference, because in their desire of obtaining and securing power they are thoroughly in earnest; there they travel in the beaten road. The public interests, because about them they have no real solicitude, they abandon wholly to chance; I say to chance, because their schemes have nothing in experience to prove their tendency beneficial.
We must always see with a pity not unmixed with respect the errors of those who are timid and doubtful of themselves with regard to points wherein the happiness of mankind is concerned. But in these gentlemen there is nothing of the tender, parental solicitude which fears to cut up the infant for the sake of an experiment. In the vastness of their promises and the confidence of their predictions, they far outdo all the boasting of empirics. The arrogance of their pretensions in a manner provokes and challenges us to an inquiry into their foundation.
I AM convinced that there are men of considerable parts among the popular leaders in the National Assembly. Some of them display eloquence in their speeches and their writings. This cannot be without powerful and cultivated talents. But eloquence may exist without a proportionable degree of wisdom. When I speak of ability, I am obliged to distinguish. What they have done toward the support of their system bespeaks no ordinary men. In the system itself, taken as the scheme of a republic constructed for procuring the prosperity and security of the citizen, and for promoting the strength and grandeur of the state, I confess myself unable to find out anything which displays in a single instance the work of a comprehensive and disposing mind or even the provisions of a vulgar prudence. Their purpose everywhere seems to have been to evade and slip aside from difficulty. This it has been the glory of the great masters in all the arts to confront, and to overcome; and when they had overcome the first difficulty, to turn it into an instrument for new conquests over new difficulties, thus to enable them to extend the empire of their science and even to push forward, beyond the reach of their original thoughts, the landmarks of the human understanding itself. Difficulty is a severe instructor, set over us by the supreme ordinance of a parental Guardian and Legislator, who knows us better than we know ourselves, as he loves us better, too. Pater ipse colendi haud facilem esse viam voluit. He that wrestles with us strengthens our nerves and sharpens our skill. Our antagonist is our helper. This amicable conflict with difficulty obliges us to an intimate acquaintance with our object and compels us to consider it in all its relations. It will not suffer us to be superficial. It is the want of nerves of understanding for such a task, it is the degenerate fondness for tricking shortcuts and little fallacious facilities that has in so many parts of the world created governments with arbitrary powers.
They have created the late arbitrary monarchy of France. They have created the arbitrary republic of Paris. With them defects in wisdom are to be supplied by the plenitude of force. They get nothing by it. Commencing their labors on a principle of sloth, they have the common fortune of slothful men. The difficulties, which they rather had eluded than escaped, meet them again in their course; they multiply and thicken on them; they are involved, through a labyrinth of confused detail, in an industry without limit and without direction; and, in conclusion, the whole of their work becomes feeble, vicious, and insecure.
It is this inability to wrestle with difficulty which has obliged the arbitrary Assembly of France to commence their schemes of reform with abolition and total destruction. But is it in destroying and pulling down that skill is displayed? Your mob can do this as well at least as your assemblies. The shallowest understanding, the rudest hand is more than equal to that task. Rage and frenzy will pull down more in half an hour than prudence, deliberation, and foresight can build up in a hundred years.
The errors and defects of old establishments are visible and palpable. It calls for little ability to point them out; and where absolute power is given, it requires but a word wholly to abolish the vice and the establishment together. The same lazy but restless disposition which loves sloth and hates quiet directs the politicians when they come to work for supplying the place of what they have destroyed. To make everything the reverse of what they have seen is quite as easy as to destroy. No difficulties occur in what has never been tried. Criticism is almost baffled in discovering the defects of what has not existed; and eager enthusiasm and cheating hope have all the wide field of imagination in which they may expatiate with little or no opposition.
At once to preserve and to reform is quite another thing. When the useful parts of an old establishment are kept, and what is superadded is to be fitted to what is retained, a vigorous mind, steady, persevering attention, various powers of comparison and combination, and the resources of an understanding fruitful in expedients are to be exercised; they are to be exercised in a continued conflict with the combined force of opposite vices, with the obstinacy that rejects all improvement and the levity that is fatigued and disgusted with everything of which it is in possession. But you may object — ""A process of this kind is slow. It is not fit for an assembly which glories in performing in a few months the work of ages. Such a mode of reforming, possibly, might take up many years"". Without question it might; and it ought. It is one of the excellences of a method in which time is amongst the assistants, that its operation is slow and in some cases almost imperceptible. If circumspection and caution are a part of wisdom when we work only upon inanimate matter, surely they become a part of duty, too, when the subject of our demolition and construction is not brick and timber but sentient beings, by the sudden alteration of whose state, condition, and habits multitudes may be rendered miserable. But it seems as if it were the prevalent opinion in Paris that an unfeeling heart and an undoubting confidence are the sole qualifications for a perfect legislator. Far different are my ideas of that high office. The true lawgiver ought to have a heart full of sensibility. He ought to love and respect his kind, and to fear himself. It may be allowed to his temperament to catch his ultimate object with an intuitive glance, but his movements toward it ought to be deliberate. Political arrangement, as it is a work for social ends, is to be only wrought by social means. There mind must conspire with mind. Time is required to produce that union of minds which alone can produce all the good we aim at. Our patience will achieve more than our force. If I might venture to appeal to what is so much out of fashion in Paris, I mean to experience, I should tell you that in my course I have known and, according to my measure, have co-operated with great men; and I have never yet seen any plan which has not been mended by the observation of those who were much inferior in understanding to the person who took the lead in the business. By a slow but well-sustained progress the effect of each step is watched; the good or ill success of the first gives light to us in the second; and so, from light to light, we are conducted with safety through the whole series. We see that the parts of the system do not clash. The evils latent in the most promising contrivances are provided for as they arise. One advantage is as little as possible sacrificed to another. We compensate, we reconcile, we balance. We are enabled to unite into a consistent whole the various anomalies and contending principles that are found in the minds and affairs of men. From hence arises, not an excellence in simplicity, but one far superior, an excellence in composition. Where the great interests of mankind are concerned through a long succession of generations, that succession ought to be admitted into some share in the councils which are so deeply to affect them. If justice requires this, the work itself requires the aid of more minds than one age can furnish. It is from this view of things that the best legislators have been often satisfied with the establishment of some sure, solid, and ruling principle in government — a power like that which some of the philosophers have called a plastic nature; and having fixed the principle, they have left it afterwards to its own operation.
To proceed in this manner, that is, to proceed with a presiding principle and a prolific energy is with me the criterion of profound wisdom. What your politicians think the marks of a bold, hardy genius are only proofs of a deplorable want of ability. By their violent haste and their defiance of the process of nature, they are delivered over blindly to every projector and adventurer, to every alchemist and empiric. They despair of turning to account anything that is common. Diet is nothing in their system of remedy. The worst of it is that this their despair of curing common distempers by regular methods arises not only from defect of comprehension but, I fear, from some malignity of disposition. Your legislators seem to have taken their opinions of all professions, ranks, and offices from the declamations and buffooneries of satirists; who would themselves be astonished if they were held to the letter of their own descriptions. By listening only to these, your leaders regard all things only on the side of their vices and faults, and view those vices and faults under every color of exaggeration. It is undoubtedly true, though it may seem paradoxical; but in general, those who are habitually employed in finding and displaying faults are unqualified for the work of reformation, because their minds are not only unfurnished with patterns of the fair and good, but by habit they come to take no delight in the contemplation of those things. By hating vices too much, they come to love men too little. It is, therefore, not wonderful that they should be indisposed and unable to serve them. From hence arises the complexional disposition of some of your guides to pull everything in pieces. At this malicious game they display the whole of their quadrimanous activity. As to the rest, the paradoxes of eloquent writers, brought forth purely as a sport of fancy to try their talents, to rouse attention and excite surprise, are taken up by these gentlemen, not in the spirit of the original authors, as means of cultivating their taste and improving their style. These paradoxes become with them serious grounds of action upon which they proceed in regulating the most important concerns of the state. Cicero ludicrously describes Cato as endeavoring to act, in the commonwealth, upon the school paradoxes which exercised the wits of the junior students in the Stoic philosophy. If this was true of Cato, these gentlemen copy after him in the manner of some persons who lived about his time — pede nudo Catonem. Mr. Hume told me that he had from Rousseau himself the secret of his principles of composition. That acute though eccentric observer had perceived that to strike and interest the public the marvelous must be produced; that the marvelous of the heathen mythology had long since lost its effect; that the giants, magicians, fairies, and heroes of romance which succeeded had exhausted the portion of credulity which belonged to their age; that now nothing was left to the writer but that species of the marvelous which might still be produced, and with as great an effect as ever, though in another way; that is, the marvelous in life, in manners, in characters, and in extraordinary situations, giving rise to new and unlooked-for strokes in politics and morals. I believe that were Rousseau alive and in one of his lucid intervals, he would be shocked at the practical frenzy of his scholars, who in their paradoxes are servile imitators, and even in their incredulity discover an implicit faith.
Men who undertake considerable things, even in a regular way, ought to give us ground to presume ability. But the physician of the state who, not satisfied with the cure of distempers, undertakes to regenerate constitutions ought to show uncommon powers. Some very unusual appearances of wisdom ought to display themselves on the face of the designs of those who appeal to no practice, and who copy after no model. Has any such been manifested? I shall take a view (it shall for the subject be a very short one) of what the Assembly has done with regard, first, to the constitution of the legislature; in the next place, to that of the executive power; then to that of the judicature; afterwards to the model of the army; and conclude with the system of finance; to see whether we can discover in any part of their schemes the portentous ability which may justify these bold undertakers in the superiority which they assume over mankind.
IT IS IN THE MODEL of the sovereign and presiding part of this new republic that we should expect their grand display. Here they were to prove their title to their proud demands. For the plan itself at large, and for the reasons on which it is grounded, I refer to the journals of the Assembly of the 29th of September, 1789, and to the subsequent proceedings which have made any alterations in the plan. So far as in a matter somewhat confused I can see light, the system remains substantially as it has been originally framed. My few remarks will be such as regard its spirit, its tendency, and its fitness for framing a popular commonwealth, which they profess theirs to be, suited to the ends for which any commonwealth, and particularly such a commonwealth, is made. At the same time I mean to consider its consistency with itself and its own principles.
Old establishments are tried by their effects. If the people are happy, united, wealthy, and powerful, we presume the rest. We conclude that to be good from whence good is derived. In old establishments various correctives have been found for their aberrations from theory. Indeed, they are the results of various necessities and expediencies. They are not often constructed after any theory; theories are rather drawn from them. In them we often see the end best obtained where the means seem not perfectly reconcilable to what we may fancy was the original scheme. The means taught by experience may be better suited to political ends than those contrived in the original project. They again react upon the primitive constitution, and sometimes improve the design itself, from which they seem to have departed. I think all this might be curiously exemplified in the British constitution. At worst, the errors and deviations of every kind in reckoning are found and computed, and the ship proceeds in her course. This is the case of old establishments; but in a new and merely theoretic system, it is expected that every contrivance shall appear, on the face of it, to answer its ends, especially where the projectors are no way embarrassed with an endeavor to accommodate the new building to an old one, either in the walls or on the foundations.
The French builders, clearing away as mere rubbish whatever they found and, like their ornamental gardeners, forming everything into an exact level, propose to rest the whole local and general legislature on three bases of three different kinds: one geometrical, one arithmetical, and the third financial; the first of which they call the basis of territory; the second, the basis of population; and the third, the basis of contribution. For the accomplishment of the first of these purposes they divide the area of their country into eighty-three pieces, regularly square, of eighteen leagues by eighteen. These large divisions are called Departments. These they portion, proceeding by square measurement, into seventeen hundred and twenty districts called Communes. These again they subdivide, still proceeding by square measurement, into smaller districts called Cantons, making in all 6400.
At first view this geometrical basis of theirs presents not much to admire or to blame. It calls for no great legislative talents. Nothing more than an accurate land surveyor, with his chain, sight, and theodolite, is requisite for such a plan as this. In the old divisions of the country, various accidents at various times and the ebb and flow of various properties and jurisdictions settled their bounds. These bounds were not made upon any fixed system, undoubtedly. They were subject to some inconveniences, but they were inconveniences for which use had found remedies, and habit had supplied accommodation and patience. In this new pavement of square within square, and this organization and semi-organization, made on the system of Empedocles and Buffon, and not upon any politic principle, it is impossible that innumerable local inconveniences, to which men are not habituated, must not arise. But these I pass over, because it requires an accurate knowledge of the country, which I do not possess, to specify them.
When these state surveyors came to take a view of their work of measurement, they soon found that in politics the most fallacious of all things was geometrical demonstration. They had then recourse to another basis (or rather buttress) to support the building, which tottered on that false foundation. It was evident that the goodness of the soil, the number of the people, their wealth, and the largeness of their contribution made such infinite variations between square and square as to render mensuration a ridiculous standard of power in the commonwealth, and equality in geometry the most unequal of all measures in the distribution of men. However, they could not give it up. But dividing their political and civil representation into three parts, they allotted one of those parts to the square measurement, without a single fact or calculation to ascertain whether this territorial proportion of representation was fairly assigned, and ought upon any principle really to be a third. Having, however, given to geometry this portion (of a third for her dower) out of compliment, I suppose, to that sublime science, they left the other two to be scuffled for between the other parts, population and contribution.
When they came to provide for population, they were not able to proceed quite so smoothly as they had done in the field of their geometry. Here their arithmetic came to bear upon their juridical metaphysics. Had they stuck to their metaphysic principles, the arithmetical process would be simple indeed. Men, with them, are strictly equal and are entitled to equal rights in their own government. Each head, on this system, would have its vote, and every man would vote directly for the person who was to represent him in the legislature. ""But soft — by regular degrees, not yet"". This metaphysic principle to which law, custom, usage, policy, reason were to yield is to yield itself to their pleasure. There must be many degrees, and some stages, before the representative can come in contact with his constituent. Indeed, as we shall soon see, these two persons are to have no sort of communion with each other. First, the voters in the Canton, who compose what they call ""primary assemblies"", are to have a qualification. What! a qualification on the indefeasible rights of men? Yes; but it shall be a very small qualification. Our injustice shall be very little oppressive: only the local valuation of three days' labor paid to the public. Why, this is not much, I readily admit, for anything but the utter subversion of your equalizing principle. As a qualification it might as well be let alone, for it answers no one purpose for which qualifications are established; and, on your ideas, it excludes from a vote the man of all others whose natural equality stands the most in need of protection and defense — I mean the man who has nothing else but his natural equality to guard him. You order him to buy the right which you before told him nature had given to him gratuitously at his birth, and of which no authority on earth could lawfully deprive him. With regard to the person who cannot come up to your market, a tyrannous aristocracy, as against him, is established at the very outset by you who pretend to be its sworn foe.
The gradation proceeds. These primary assemblies of the Canton elect deputies to the Commune; one for every two hundred qualified inhabitants. Here is the first medium put between the primary elector and the representative legislator; and here a new turnpike is fixed for taxing the rights of men with a second qualification; for none can be elected into the Commune who does not pay the amount of ten days' labor. Nor have we yet done. There is still to be another gradation. These Communes, chosen by the Canton, choose to the Department; and the deputies of the Department choose their deputies to the National Assembly. Here is a third barrier of a senseless qualification. Every deputy to the National Assembly must pay, in direct contribution, to the value of a mark of silver. Of all these qualifying barriers we must think alike — that they are impotent to secure independence, strong only to destroy the rights of men.
In all this process, which in its fundamental elements affects to consider only population upon a principle of natural right, there is a manifest attention to property, which, however just and reasonable on other schemes, is on theirs perfectly unsupportable.
When they come to their third basis, that of contribution, we find that they have more completely lost sight of their rights of men. This last basis rests entirely on property. A principle totally different from the equality of men, and utterly irreconcilable to it, is thereby admitted; but no sooner is this principle admitted than (as usual) it is subverted; and it is not subverted (as we shall presently see) to approximate the inequality of riches to the level of nature. The additional share in the third portion of representation (a portion reserved exclusively for the higher contribution) is made to regard the district only, and not the individuals in it who pay. It is easy to perceive, by the course of their reasonings, how much they were embarrassed by their contradictory ideas of the rights of men and the privileges of riches. The committee of constitution do as good as admit that they are wholly irreconcilable. ""The relation with regard to the contributions is without doubt null (say they) when the question is on the balance of the political rights as between individual and individual, without which personal equality would be destroyed and an aristocracy of the rich would be established. But this inconvenience entirely disappears when the proportional relation of the contribution is only considered in the great masses, and is solely between province and province; it serves in that case only to form a just reciprocal proportion between the cities without affecting the personal rights of the citizens"".
Here the principle of contribution, as taken between man and man, is reprobated as null and destructive to equality, and as pernicious, too, because it leads to the establishment of an aristocracy of the rich. However, it must not be abandoned. And the way of getting rid of the difficulty is to establish the inequality as between department and department, leaving all the individuals in each department upon an exact par. Observe that this parity between individuals had been before destroyed when the qualifications within the departments were settled; nor does it seem a matter of great importance whether the equality of men be injured by masses or individually. An individual is not of the same importance in a mass represented by a few as in a mass represented by many. It would be too much to tell a man jealous of his equality that the elector has the same franchise who votes for three members as he who votes for ten.
Now take it in the outer point of view and let us suppose their principle of representation according to contribution, that is, according to riches, to be well imagined and to be a necessary basis for their republic. In this their third basis they assume that riches ought to be respected, and that justice and policy require that they should entitle men, in some mode or other, to a larger share in the administration of public affairs; it is now to be seen how the Assembly provides for the preeminence, or even for the security, of the rich by conferring, in virtue of their opulence, that larger measure of power to their district which is denied to them personally. I readily admit (indeed I should lay it down as a fundamental principle) that in a republican government which has a democratic basis the rich do require an additional security above what is necessary to them in monarchies. They are subject to envy, and through envy to oppression. On the present scheme it is impossible to divine what advantage they derive from the aristocratic preference upon which the unequal representation of the masses is founded. The rich cannot feel it, either as a support to dignity or as security to fortune, for the aristocratic mass is generated from purely democratic principles, and the preference given to it in the general representation has no sort of reference to, or connection with, the persons upon account of whose property this superiority of the mass is established. If the contrivers of this scheme meant any sort of favor to the rich, in consequence of their contribution, they ought to have conferred the privilege either on the individual rich or on some class formed of rich persons (as historians represent Servius Tullius to have done in the early constitution of Rome), because the contest between the rich and the poor is not a struggle between corporation and corporation, but a contest between men and men — a competition not between districts, but between descriptions. It would answer its purpose better if the scheme were inverted: that the vote of the masses were rendered equal, and that the votes within each mass were proportioned to property.
Let us suppose one man in a district (it is an easy supposition) to contribute as much as a hundred of his neighbors. Against these he has but one vote. If there were but one representative for the mass, his poor neighbors would outvote him by a hundred to one for that single representative. Bad enough. But amends are to be made him. How? The district, in virtue of his wealth, is to choose, say, ten members instead of one; that is to say, by paying a very large contribution he has the happiness of being outvoted a hundred to one by the poor for ten representatives, instead of being outvoted exactly in the same proportion for a single member. In truth, instead of benefiting by this superior quantity of representation, the rich man is subjected to an additional hardship. The increase of representation within his province sets up nine persons more, and as many more than nine as there may be democratic candidates, to cabal and intrigue, and to flatter the people at his expense and to his oppression. An interest is by this means held out to multitudes of the inferior sort, in obtaining a salary of eighteen livres a day (to them a vast object) besides the pleasure of a residence in Paris and their share in the government of the kingdom. The more the objects of ambition are multiplied and become democratic, just in that proportion the rich are endangered.
Thus it must fare between the poor and the rich in the province deemed aristocratic, which in its internal relation is the very reverse of that character. In its external relation, that is, its relation to the other provinces, I cannot see how the unequal representation which is given to masses on account of wealth becomes the means of preserving the equipoise and the tranquillity of the commonwealth. For if it be one of the objects to secure the weak from being crushed by the strong (as in all society undoubtedly it is), how are the smaller and poorer of these masses to be saved from the tyranny of the more wealthy? Is it by adding to the wealthy further and more systematical means of oppressing them? When we come to a balance of representation between corporate bodies, provincial interests, emulations, and jealousies are full as likely to arise among them as among individuals; and their divisions are likely to produce a much hotter spirit of dissension, and something leading much more nearly to a war.
I see that these aristocratic masses are made upon what is called the principle of direct contribution. Nothing can be a more unequal standard than this. The indirect contribution, that which arises from duties on consumption, is in truth a better standard and follows and discovers wealth more naturally than this of direct contribution. It is difficult, indeed, to fix a standard of local preference on account of the one, or of the other, or of both, because some provinces may pay the more of either or of both on account of causes not intrinsic, but originating from those very districts over whom they have obtained a preference in consequence of their ostensible contribution. If the masses were independent, sovereign bodies who were to provide for a federative treasury by distinct contingents, and that the revenue had not (as it has) many impositions running through the whole, which affect men individually, and not corporately, and which, by their nature, confound all territorial limits, something might be said for the basis of contribution as founded on masses. But of all things, this representation, to be measured by contribution, is the most difficult to settle upon principles of equity in a country which considers its districts as members of a whole. For a great city, such as Bordeaux or Paris, appears to pay a vast body of duties, almost out of all assignable proportion to other places, and its mass is considered accordingly. But are these cities the true contributors in that proportion? No. The consumers of the commodities imported into Bordeaux, who are scattered through all France, pay the import duties of Bordeaux. The produce of the vintage in Guienne and Languedoc give to that city the means of its contribution growing out of an export commerce. The landholders who spend their estates in Paris, and are thereby the creators of that city, contribute for Paris from the provinces out of which their revenues arise. Very nearly the same arguments will apply to the representative share given on account of direct contributions, because the direct contribution must be assessed on wealth, real or presumed; and that local wealth will itself arise from causes not local, and which therefore in equity ought not to produce a local preference.
It is very remarkable that in this fundamental regulation which settles the representation of the mass upon the direct contribution, they have not yet settled how that direct contribution shall be laid, and how apportioned. Perhaps there is some latent policy toward the continuance of the present Assembly in this strange procedure. However, until they do this, they can have no certain constitution. It must depend at last upon the system of taxation, and must vary with every variation in that system. As they have contrived matters, their taxation does not so much depend on their constitution as their constitution on their taxation. This must introduce great confusion among the masses, as the variable qualification for votes within the district must, if ever real contested elections take place, cause infinite internal controversies.
To compare together the three bases, not on their political reason, but on the ideas on which the Assembly works, and to try its consistency with itself, we cannot avoid observing that the principle which the committee call the basis of population does not begin to operate from the same point with the two other principles called the bases of territory and of contribution, which are both of an aristocratic nature. The consequence is that, where all three begin to operate together, there is the most absurd inequality produced by the operation of the former on the two latter principles. Every canton contains four square leagues, and is estimated to contain, on the average, 4000 inhabitants or 680 voters in the primary assemblies, which vary in numbers with the population of the canton, and send one deputy to the commune for every 200 voters. Nine cantons make a commune.
Now let us take a canton containing a seaport town of trade, or a great manufacturing town. Let us suppose the population of this canton to be 12,700 inhabitants, or 2193 voters, forming three primary assemblies, and sending ten deputies to the commune.
Oppose to this one canton two others of the remaining eight in the same commune. These we may suppose to have their fair population of 4000 inhabitants and 680 voters each, or 8000 inhabitants and 1360 voters, both together. These will form only two primary assemblies and send only six deputies to the commune.
When the assembly of the commune comes to vote on the basis of territory, which principle is first admitted to operate in that assembly, the single canton which has half the territory of the other two will have ten voices to six in the election of three deputies to the assembly of the department chosen on the express ground of a representation of territory.
This inequality, striking as it is, will be yet highly aggravated if we suppose, as we fairly may, the several other cantons of the commune to fall proportionably short of the average population, as much as the principal canton exceeds it. Now as to the basis of contribution, which also is a principle admitted first to operate in the assembly of the commune. Let us again take one canton, such as is stated above. If the whole of the direct contributions paid by a great trading or manufacturing town be divided equally among the inhabitants, each individual will be found to pay much more than an individual living in the country according to the same average. The whole paid by the inhabitants of the former will be more than the whole paid by the inhabitants of the latter — we may fairly assume one-third more. Then the 12,700 inhabitants, or 2193 voters of the canton, will pay as much as 19,050 inhabitants, or 3289 voters of the other cantons, which are nearly the estimated proportion of inhabitants and voters of five other cantons. Now the 2193 voters will, as I before said, send only ten deputies to the assembly; the 3289 voters will send sixteen. Thus, for an equal share in the contribution of the whole commune, there will be a difference of sixteen voices to ten in voting for deputies to be chosen on the principle of representing the general contribution of the whole commune.
By the same mode of computation we shall find 15,875 inhabitants, or 2741 voters of the other cantons, who pay one-sixth LESS to the contribution of the whole commune, will have three VOICES MORE than the 12,700 inhabitants, or 2193 voters of the one canton.
Such is the fantastical and unjust inequality between mass and mass in this curious repartition of the rights of representation arising out of territory and contribution. The qualifications which these confer are in truth negative qualifications, that give a right in an inverse proportion to the possession of them.
In this whole contrivance of the three bases, consider it in any light you please, I do not see a variety of objects reconciled in one consistent whole, but several contradictory principles reluctantly and irreconcilably brought and held together by your philosophers, like wild beasts shut up in a cage to claw and bite each other to their mutual destruction.
I am afraid I have gone too far into their way of considering the formation of a constitution. They have much, but bad, metaphysics; much, but bad, geometry; much, but false, proportionate arithmetic; but if it were all as exact as metaphysics, geometry, and arithmetic ought to be, and if their schemes were perfectly consistent in all their parts, it would make only a more fair and sightly vision. It is remarkable that, in a great arrangement of mankind, not one reference whatsoever is to be found to anything moral or anything politic, nothing that relates to the concerns, the actions, the passions, the interests of men. Hominem non sapiunt.
You see I only consider this constitution as electoral, and leading by steps to the National Assembly. I do not enter into the internal government of the departments and their genealogy through the communes and cantons. These local governments are, in the original plan, to be as nearly as possible composed in the same manner and on the same principles with the elective assemblies. They are each of them bodies perfectly compact and rounded in themselves.
You cannot but perceive in this scheme that it has a direct and immediate tendency to sever France into a variety of republics, and to render them totally independent of each other without any direct constitutional means of coherence, connection, or subordination, except what may be derived from their acquiescence in the determinations of the general congress of the ambassadors from each independent republic. Such in reality is the National Assembly, and such governments I admit do exist in the world, though in forms infinitely more suitable to the local and habitual circumstances of their people. But such associations, rather than bodies politic, have generally been the effect of necessity, not choice; and I believe the present French power is the very first body of citizens who, having obtained full authority to do with their country what they pleased, have chosen to dissever it in this barbarous manner.
It is impossible not to observe that, in the spirit of this geometrical distribution and arithmetical arrangement, these pretended citizens treat France exactly like a country of conquest. Acting as conquerors, they have imitated the policy of the harshest of that harsh race. The policy of such barbarous victors, who contemn a subdued people and insult their feelings, has ever been, as much as in them lay, to destroy all vestiges of the ancient country, in religion, in polity, in laws, and in manners; to confound all territorial limits; to produce a general poverty; to put up their properties to auction; to crush their princes, nobles, and pontiffs; to lay low everything which had lifted its head above the level, or which could serve to combine or rally, in their distresses, the disbanded people under the standard of old opinion. They have made France free in the manner in which those sincere friends to the rights of mankind, the Romans, freed Greece, Macedon, and other nations. They destroyed the bonds of their union under color of providing for the independence of each of their cities.
When the members who compose these new bodies of cantons, communes, and departments — arrangements purposely produced through the medium of confusion — begin to act, they will find themselves in a great measure strangers to one another. The electors and elected throughout, especially in the rural cantons, will be frequently without any civil habitudes or connections, or any of that natural discipline which is the soul of a true republic. Magistrates and collectors of revenue are now no longer acquainted with their districts, bishops with their dioceses, or curates with their parishes. These new colonies of the rights of men bear a strong resemblance to that sort of military colonies which Tacitus has observed upon in the declining policy of Rome. In better and wiser days (whatever course they took with foreign nations) they were careful to make the elements of methodical subordination and settlement to be coeval, and even to lay the foundations of civil discipline in the military. But when all the good arts had fallen into ruin, they proceeded, as your Assembly does, upon the equality of men, and with as little judgment and as little care for those things which make a republic tolerable or durable. But in this, as well as almost every instance, your new commonwealth is born and bred and fed in those corruptions which mark degenerated and worn-out republics. Your child comes into the world with the symptoms of death: the facies Hippocratica forms the character of its physiognomy, and the prognostic of its fate.
The legislators who framed the ancient republics knew that their business was too arduous to be accomplished with no better apparatus than the metaphysics of an undergraduate, and the mathematics and arithmetic of an exciseman. They had to do with men, and they were obliged to study human nature. They had to do with citizens, and they were obliged to study the effects of those habits which are communicated by the circumstances of civil life. They were sensible that the operation of this second nature on the first produced a new combination; and thence arose many diversities amongst men, according to their birth, their education, their professions, the periods of their lives, their residence in towns or in the country, their several ways of acquiring and of fixing property, and according to the quality of the property itself — all which rendered them as it were so many different species of animals. From hence they thought themselves obliged to dispose their citizens into such classes, and to place them in such situations in the state, as their peculiar habits might qualify them to fill, and to allot to them such appropriated privileges as might secure to them what their specific occasions required, and which might furnish to each description such force as might protect it in the conflict caused by the diversity of interests that must exist and must contend in all complex society; for the legislator would have been ashamed that the coarse husbandman should well know how to assort and to use his sheep, horses, and oxen, and should have enough of common sense not to abstract and equalize them all into animals without providing for each kind an appropriate food, care, and employment, whilst he, the economist, disposer, and shepherd of his own kindred, subliming himself into an airy metaphysician, was resolved to know nothing of his flocks but as men in general. It is for this reason that Montesquieu observed very justly that in their classification of the citizens the great legislators of antiquity made the greatest display of their powers, and even soared above themselves. It is here that your modern legislators have gone deep into the negative series, and sunk even below their own nothing. As the first sort of legislators attended to the different kinds of citizens and combined them into one commonwealth, the others, the metaphysical and alchemistical legislators, have taken the direct contrary course. They have attempted to confound all sorts of citizens, as well as they could, into one homogeneous mass; and then they divided this their amalgama into a number of incoherent republics. They reduce men to loose counters, merely for the sake of simple telling, and not to figures whose power is to arise from their place in the table. The elements of their own metaphysics might have taught them better lessons. The troll of their categorical table might have informed them that there was something else in the intellectual world besides substance and quantity. They might learn from the catechism of metaphysics that there were eight heads more in every complex deliberation which they have never thought of, though these, of all the ten, are the subjects on which the skill of man can operate anything at all.
So far from this able disposition of some of the old republican legislators, which follows with a solicitous accuracy the moral conditions and propensities of men, they have leveled and crushed together all the orders which they found, even under the coarse unartificial arrangement of the monarchy, in which mode of government the classing of the citizens is not of so much importance as in a republic. It is true, however, that every such classification, if properly ordered, is good in all forms of government, and composes a strong barrier against the excesses of despotism, as well as it is the necessary means of giving effect and permanence to a republic. For want of something of this kind, if the present project of a republic should fail, all securities to a moderated freedom fail along with it; all the indirect restraints which mitigate despotism are removed, insomuch that if monarchy should ever again obtain an entire ascendancy in France, under this or under any other dynasty, it will probably be, if not voluntarily tempered at setting out by the wise and virtuous counsels of the prince, the most completely arbitrary power that has ever appeared on earth. This is to play a most desperate game.
The confusion which attends on all such proceedings they even declare to be one of their objects, and they hope to secure their constitution by a terror of a return of those evils which attended their making it. ""By this,"" say they, ""its destruction will become difficult to authority, which cannot break it up without the entire disorganization of the whole state."" They presume that, if this authority should ever come to the same degree of power that they have acquired, it would make a more moderate and chastised use of it, and would piously tremble entirely to disorganize the state in the savage manner that they have done. They expect, from the virtues of returning despotism, the security which is to be enjoyed by the offspring of their popular vices.
I WISH, Sir, that you and my readers would give an attentive perusal to the work of M. de Calonne on this subject. It is, indeed, not only an eloquent, but an able and instructive, performance. I confine myself to what he says relative to the constitution of the new state and to the condition of the revenue. As to the disputes of this minister with his rivals, I do not wish to pronounce upon them. As little do I mean to hazard any opinion concerning his ways and means, financial or political, for taking his country out of its present disgraceful and deplorable situation of servitude, anarchy, bankruptcy, and beggary. I cannot speculate quite so sanguinely as he does; but he is a Frenchman, and has a closer duty relative to those objects, and better means of judging of them, than I can have. I wish that the formal avowal which he refers to, made by one of the principal leaders in the Assembly concerning the tendency of their scheme to bring France not only from a monarchy to a republic, but from a republic to a mere confederacy, may be very particularly attended to. It adds new force to my observations, and indeed M. de Calonne's work supplies my deficiencies by many new and striking arguments on most of the subjects of this letter.
It is this resolution, to break their country into separate republics, which has driven them into the greatest number of their difficulties and contradictions. If it were not for this, all the questions of exact equality and these balances, never to be settled, of individual rights, population, and contribution would be wholly useless. The representation, though derived from parts, would be a duty which equally regarded the whole. Each deputy to the Assembly would be the representative of France, and of all its descriptions, of the many and of the few, of the rich and of the poor, of the great districts and of the small. All these districts would themselves be subordinate to some standing authority, existing independently of them, an authority in which their representation, and everything that belongs to it, originated, and to which it was pointed. This standing, unalterable, fundamental government would make, and it is the only thing which could make, that territory truly and properly a whole. With us, when we elect popular representatives, we send them to a council in which each man individually is a subject and submitted to a government complete in all its ordinary functions. With you the elective Assembly is the sovereign, and the sole sovereign; all the members are therefore integral parts of this sole sovereignty. But with us it is totally different. With us the representative, separated from the other parts, can have no action and no existence. The government is the point of reference of the several members and districts of our representation. This is the center of our unity. This government of reference is a trustee for the whole, and not for the parts. So is the other branch of our public council, I mean the House of Lords. With us the king and the lords are several and joint securities for the equality of each district, each province, each city. When did you hear in Great Britain of any province suffering from the inequality of its representation, what district from having no representation at all? Not only our monarchy and our peerage secure the equality on which our unity depends, but it is the spirit of the House of Commons itself. The very inequality of representation, which is so foolishly complained of, is perhaps the very thing which prevents us from thinking or acting as members for districts. Cornwall elects as many members as all Scotland. But is Cornwall better taken care of than Scotland? Few trouble their heads about any of your bases, out of some giddy clubs. Most of those who wish for any change, upon any plausible grounds, desire it on different ideas.
Your new constitution is the very reverse of ours in its principle; and I am astonished how any persons could dream of holding out anything done in it as an example for Great Britain. With you there is little, or rather no, connection between the last representative and the first constituent. The member who goes to the National Assembly is not chosen by the people, nor accountable to them. There are three elections before he is chosen; two sets of magistracy intervene between him and the primary assembly, so as to render him, as I have said, an ambassador of a state, and not the representative of the people within a state. By this the whole spirit of the election is changed, nor can any corrective which your constitution-mongers have devised render him anything else than what he is. The very attempt to do it would inevitably introduce a confusion, if possible, more horrid than the present. There is no way to make a connection between the original constituent and the representative, but by the circuitous means which may lead the candidate to apply in the first instance to the primary electors, in order that by their authoritative instructions (and something more perhaps) these primary electors may force the two succeeding bodies of electors to make a choice agreeable to their wishes. But this would plainly subvert the whole scheme. It would be to plunge them back into that tumult and confusion of popular election which, by their interposed gradation of elections, they mean to avoid, and at length to risk the whole fortune of the state with those who have the least knowledge of it and the least interest in it. This is a perpetual dilemma into which they are thrown by the vicious, weak, and contradictory principles they have chosen. Unless the people break up and level this gradation, it is plain that they do not at all substantially elect to the Assembly; indeed, they elect as little in appearance as reality.
What is it we all seek for in an election? To answer its real purposes, you must first possess the means of knowing the fitness of your man; and then you must retain some hold upon him by personal obligation or dependence. For what end are these primary electors complimented, or rather mocked, with a choice? They can never know anything of the qualities of him that is to serve them, nor has he any obligation whatsoever to them. Of all the powers unfit to be delegated by those who have any real means of judging, that most peculiarly unfit is what relates to a personal choice. In case of abuse, that body of primary electors never can call the representative to an account for his conduct. He is too far removed from them in the chain of representation. If he acts improperly at the end of his two years' lease, it does not concern him for two years more. By the new French constitution the best and the wisest representatives go equally with the worst into this Limbus Patrum. Their bottoms are supposed foul, and they must go into dock to be refitted. Every man who has served in an assembly is ineligible for two years after. Just as these magistrates begin to learn their trade, like chimney sweepers, they are disqualified for exercising it. Superficial, new, petulant acquisition, and interrupted, dronish, broken, ill recollection is to be the destined character of all your future governors. Your constitution has too much of jealousy to have much of sense in it. You consider the breach of trust in the representative so principally that you do not at all regard the question of his fitness to execute it.
This purgatory interval is not unfavorable to a faithless representative, who may be as good a canvasser as he was a bad governor. In this time he may cabal himself into a superiority over the wisest and most virtuous. As in the end all the members of this elective constitution are equally fugitive and exist only for the election, they may be no longer the same persons who had chosen him, to whom he is to be responsible when he solicits for a renewal of his trust. To call all the secondary electors of the Commune to account is ridiculous, impracticable, and unjust; they may themselves have been deceived in their choice, as the third set of electors, those of the Department, may be in theirs. In your elections responsibility cannot exist.
FINDING NO SORT OF PRINCIPLE of coherence with each other in the nature and constitution of the several new republics of France, I considered what cement the legislators had provided for them from any extraneous materials. Their confederations, their spectacles, their civic feasts, and their enthusiasm I take no notice of; they are nothing but mere tricks; but tracing their policy through their actions, I think I can distinguish the arrangements by which they propose to hold these republics together. The first is the confiscation, with the compulsory paper currency annexed to it; the second is the supreme power of the city of Paris; the third is the general army of the state. Of this last I shall reserve what I have to say until I come to consider the army as a head by itself.
As to the operation of the first (the confiscation and paper currency) merely as a cement, I cannot deny that these, the one depending on the other, may for some time compose some sort of cement if their madness and folly in the management, and in the tempering of the parts together, does not produce a repulsion in the very outset. But allowing to the scheme some coherence and some duration, it appears to me that if, after a while, the confiscation should not be found sufficient to support the paper coinage (as I am morally certain it will not), then, instead of cementing, it will add infinitely to the dissociation, distraction, and confusion of these confederate republics, both with relation to each other and to the several parts within themselves. But if the confiscation should so far succeed as to sink the paper currency, the cement is gone with the circulation. In the meantime its binding force will be very uncertain, and it will straighten or relax with every variation in the credit of the paper.
One thing only is certain in this scheme, which is an effect seemingly collateral, but direct, I have no doubt, in the minds of those who conduct this business, that is, its effect in producing an oligarchy in every one of the republics. A paper circulation, not founded on any real money deposited or engaged for, amounting already to forty-four millions of English money, and this currency by force substituted in the place of the coin of the kingdom, becoming thereby the substance of its revenue as well as the medium of all its commercial and civil intercourse, must put the whole of what power, authority, and influence is left, in any form whatsoever it may assume, into the hands of the managers and conductors of this circulation.
In England, we feel the influence of the Bank, though it is only the center of a voluntary dealing. He knows little indeed of the influence of money upon mankind who does not see the force of the management of a monied concern which is so much more extensive and in its nature so much more depending on the managers than any of ours. But this is not merely a money concern. There is another member in the system inseparably connected with this money management. It consists in the means of drawing out at discretion portions of the confiscated lands for sale, and carrying on a process of continual transmutation of paper into land, and land into paper. When we follow this process in its effects, we may conceive something of the intensity of the force with which this system must operate. By this means the spirit of money-jobbing and speculation goes into the mass of land itself and incorporates with it. By this kind of operation that species of property becomes (as it were) volatilized; it assumes an unnatural and monstrous activity, and thereby throws into the hands of the several managers, principal and subordinate, Parisian and provincial, all the representative of money and perhaps a full tenth part of all the land in France, which has now acquired the worst and most pernicious part of the evil of a paper circulation, the greatest possible uncertainty in its value. They have reversed the Latonian kindness to the landed property of Delos. They have sent theirs to be blown about, like the light fragments of a wreck, oras et littora circum.
The new dealers, being all habitually adventurers and without any fixed habits of local predilections, will purchase to job out again, as the market of paper or of money or of land shall present an advantage. For though a holy bishop thinks that agriculture will derive great advantages from the ""enlightened"" usurers who are to purchase the church confiscations, I, who am not a good but an old farmer, with great humility beg leave to tell his late lordship that usury is not a tutor of agriculture; and if the word ""enlightened"" be understood according to the new dictionary, as it always is in your new schools, I cannot conceive how a man's not believing in God can teach him to cultivate the earth with the least of any additional skill or encouragement. ""Diis immortalibus sero"", said an old Roman, when he held one handle of the plough, whilst Death held the other. Though you were to join in the commission all the directors of the two academies to the directors of the Caisse d'Escompte, one old, experienced peasant is worth them all. I have got more information upon a curious and interesting branch of husbandry, in one short conversation with an old Carthusian monk, than I have derived from all the Bank directors that I have ever conversed with. However, there is no cause for apprehension from the meddling of money dealers with rural economy. These gentlemen are too wise in their generation. At first, perhaps, their tender and susceptible imaginations may be captivated with the innocent and unprofitable delights of a pastoral life; but in a little time they will find that agriculture is a trade much more laborious, and much less lucrative, than that which they had left. After making its panegyric, they will turn their backs on it like their great precursor and prototype. They may, like him, begin by singing ""Beatus ille"" but what will be the end?
    Haec ubi locutus foenerator Alphius,
    Jam jam futurus rusticus
    Omnem redegit idibus pecuniam;
    Quaerit calendis ponere.
They will cultivate the Caisse d'Eglise, under the sacred auspices of this prelate, with much more profit than its vineyards and its cornfields. They will employ their talents according to their habits and their interests. They will not follow the plough whilst they can direct treasuries and govern provinces.
Your legislators, in everything new, are the very first who have founded a commonwealth upon gaming, and infused this spirit into it as its vital breath. The great object in these politics is to metamorphose France from a great kingdom into one great playtable; to turn its inhabitants into a nation of gamesters; to make speculation as extensive as life; to mix it with all its concerns and to divert the whole of the hopes and fears of the people from their usual channels into the impulses, passions, and superstitions of those who live on chances. They loudly proclaim their opinion that this their present system of a republic cannot possibly exist without this kind of gaming fund, and that the very thread of its life is spun out of the staple of these speculations. The old gaming in funds was mischievous enough, undoubtedly, but it was so only to individuals. Even when it had its greatest extent, in the Mississippi and South Sea, it affected but few, comparatively; where it extends further, as in lotteries, the spirit has but a single object. But where the law, which in most circumstances forbids, and in none countenances, gaming, is itself debauched so as to reverse its nature and policy and expressly to force the subject to this destructive table by bringing the spirit and symbols of gaming into the minutest matters and engaging everybody in it, and in everything, a more dreadful epidemic distemper of that kind is spread than yet has appeared in the world. With you a man can neither earn nor buy his dinner without a speculation. What he receives in the morning will not have the same value at night. What he is compelled to take as pay for an old debt will not be received as the same when he comes to pay a debt contracted by himself, nor will it be the same when by prompt payment he would avoid contracting any debt at all. Industry must wither away. Economy must be driven from your country. Careful provision will have no existence. Who will labor without knowing the amount of his pay? Who will study to increase what none can estimate? Who will accumulate, when he does not know the value of what he saves? If you abstract it from its uses in gaming, to accumulate your paper wealth would be not the providence of a man, but the distempered instinct of a jackdaw.
The truly melancholy part of the policy of systematically making a nation of gamesters is this, that though all are forced to play, few can understand the game; and fewer still are in a condition to avail themselves of the knowledge. The many must be the dupes of the few who conduct the machine of these speculations. What effect it must have on the country people is visible. The townsman can calculate from day to day, not so the inhabitant of the country. When the peasant first brings his corn to market, the magistrate in the towns obliges him to take the assignat at par; when he goes to the shop with his money, he finds it seven per cent the worse for crossing the way. This market he will not readily resort to again. The townspeople will be inflamed; they will force the country people to bring their corn. Resistance will begin, and the murders of Paris and St. Denis may be renewed through all France.
What signifies the empty compliment paid to the country by giving it, perhaps, more than its share in the theory of your representation? Where have you placed the real power over monied and landed circulation? Where have you placed the means of raising and falling the value of every man's freehold? Those whose operations can take from, or add ten per cent to, the possessions of every man in France must be the masters of every man in France. The whole of the power obtained by this revolution will settle in the towns among the burghers and the monied directors who lead them. The landed gentleman, the yeoman, and the peasant have, none of them, habits or inclinations or experience which can lead them to any share in this the sole source of power and influence now left in France. The very nature of a country life, the very nature of landed property, in all the occupations, and all the pleasures they afford, render combination and arrangement (the sole way of procuring and exerting influence) in a manner impossible amongst country people. Combine them by all the art you can, and all the industry, they are always dissolving into individuality. Anything in the nature of incorporation is almost impracticable amongst them. Hope, fear, alarm, jealousy, the ephemerous tale that does its business and dies in a day — all these things which are the reins and spurs by which leaders check or urge the minds of followers are not easily employed, or hardly at all, amongst scattered people. They assemble, they arm, they act with the utmost difficulty and at the greatest charge. Their efforts, if ever they can be commenced, cannot be sustained. They cannot proceed systematically. If the country gentlemen attempt an influence through the mere income of their property, what is it to that of those who have ten times their income to sell, and who can ruin their property by bringing their plunder to meet it at market? If the landed man wishes to mortgage, he falls the value of his land and raises the value of assignats. He augments the power of his enemy by the very means he must take to contend with him. The country gentleman, therefore, the officer by sea and land, the man of liberal views and habits, attached to no profession, will be as completely excluded from the government of his country as if he were legislatively proscribed. It is obvious that in the towns all things which conspire against the country gentleman combine in favor of the money manager and director. In towns combination is natural. The habits of burghers, their occupations, their diversion, their business, their idleness continually bring them into mutual contact. Their virtues and their vices are sociable; they are always in garrison; and they come embodied and half disciplined into the hands of those who mean to form them for civil or military action.
All these considerations leave no doubt on my mind that, if this monster of a constitution can continue, France will be wholly governed by the agitators in corporations, by societies in the towns formed of directors of assignats, and trustees for the sale of church lands, attorneys, agents, money jobbers, speculators, and adventurers, composing an ignoble oligarchy founded on the destruction of the crown, the church, the nobility, and the people. Here end all the deceitful dreams and visions of the equality and rights of men. In the Serbonian bog of this base oligarchy they are all absorbed, sunk, and lost forever.
Though human eyes cannot trace them, one would be tempted to think some great offenses in France must cry to heaven, which has thought fit to punish it with a subjection to a vile and inglorious domination in which no comfort or compensation is to be found in any, even of those false, splendors which, playing about other tyrannies, prevent mankind from feeling themselves dishonored even whilst they are oppressed. I must confess I am touched with a sorrow, mixed with some indignation, at the conduct of a few men, once of great rank and still of great character, who, deluded with specious names, have engaged in a business too deep for the line of their understanding to fathom; who have lent their fair reputation and the authority of their high-sounding names to the designs of men with whom they could not be acquainted, and have thereby made their very virtues operate to the ruin of their country.
So far as to the first cementing principle.
THE second material of cement for their new republic is the superiority of the city of Paris; and this I admit is strongly connected with the other cementing principle of paper circulation and confiscation. It is in this part of the project we must look for the cause of the destruction of all the old bounds of provinces and jurisdictions, ecclesiastical and secular, and the dissolution of all ancient combinations of things, as well as the formation of so many small unconnected republics. The power of the city of Paris is evidently one great spring of all their politics. It is through the power of Paris, now become the center and focus of jobbing, that the leaders of this faction direct, or rather command, the whole legislative and the whole executive government. Everything, therefore, must be done which can confirm the authority of that city over the other republics. Paris is compact; she has an enormous strength, wholly disproportioned to the force of any of the square republics; and this strength is collected and condensed within a narrow compass. Paris has a natural and easy connection of its parts, which will not be affected by any scheme of a geometrical constitution, nor does it much signify whether its proportion of representation be more or less, since it has the whole draft of fishes in its dragnet. The other divisions of the kingdom, being hackled and torn to pieces, and separated from all their habitual means and even principles of union, cannot, for some time at least, confederate against her. Nothing was to be left in all the subordinate members but weakness, disconnection, and confusion. To confirm this part of the plan, the Assembly has lately come to a resolution that no two of their republics shall have the same commander-in-chief.
To a person who takes a view of the whole, the strength of Paris, thus formed, will appear a system of general weakness. It is boasted that the geometrical policy has been adopted, that all local ideas should be sunk, and that the people should no longer be Gascons, Picards, Bretons, Normans, but Frenchmen, with one country, one heart, and one Assembly. But instead of being all Frenchmen, the greater likelihood is that the inhabitants of that region will shortly have no country. No man ever was attached by a sense of pride, partiality, or real affection to a description of square measurement. He never will glory in belonging to the Chequer No. 71, or to any other badge-ticket. We begin our public affections in our families. No cold relation is a zealous citizen. We pass on to our neighborhoods and our habitual provincial connections. These are inns and resting places. Such divisions of our country as have been formed by habit, and not by a sudden jerk of authority, were so many little images of the great country in which the heart found something which it could fill. The love to the whole is not extinguished by this subordinate partiality. Perhaps it is a sort of elemental training to those higher and more large regards by which alone men come to be affected, as with their own concern, in the prosperity of a kingdom so extensive as that of France. In that general territory itself, as in the old name of provinces, the citizens are interested from old prejudices and unreasoned habits, and not on account of the geometric properties of its figure. The power and pre-eminence of Paris does certainly press down and hold these republics together as long as it lasts. But, for the reasons I have already given you, I think it cannot last very long.
Passing from the civil creating and the civil cementing principles of this constitution to the National Assembly, which is to appear and act as sovereign, we see a body in its constitution with every possible power, and no possible external control. We see a body without fundamental laws, without established maxims, without respected rules of proceeding, which nothing can keep firm to any system whatsoever. Their idea of their powers is always taken at the utmost stretch of legislative competence, and their examples for common cases from the exceptions of the most urgent necessity. The future is to be in most respects like the present Assembly; but, by the mode of the new elections and the tendency of the new circulations, it will be purged of the small degree of internal control existing in a minority chosen originally from various interests, and preserving something of their spirit. If possible, the next Assembly must be worse than the present. The present, by destroying and altering everything, will leave to their successors apparently nothing popular to do. They will be roused by emulation and example to enterprises the boldest and the most absurd. To suppose such an Assembly sitting in perfect quietude is ridiculous.
Your all-sufficient legislators, in their hurry to do everything at once, have forgotten one thing that seems essential, and which I believe never has been before, in the theory or the practice, omitted by any projector of a republic. They have forgotten to constitute a senate or something of that nature and character. Never before this time was heard of a body politic composed of one legislative and active assembly, and its executive officers, without such a council, without something to which foreign states might connect themselves; something to which, in the ordinary detail of government, the people could look up; something which might give a bias and steadiness and preserve something like consistency in the proceedings of state. Such a body kings generally have as a council. A monarchy may exist without it, but it seems to be in the very essence of a republican government. It holds a sort of middle place between the supreme power exercised by the people, or immediately delegated from them, and the mere executive. Of this there are no traces in your constitution, and in providing nothing of this kind your Solons and Numas have, as much as in anything else, discovered a sovereign incapacity.
LET US NOW TURN OUR EYES to what they have done toward the formation of an executive power. For this they have chosen a degraded king. This their first executive officer is to be a machine without any sort of deliberative discretion in any one act of his function. At best he is but a channel to convey to the National Assembly such matter as it may import that body to know. If he had been made the exclusive channel, the power would not have been without its importance, though infinitely perilous to those who would choose to exercise it. But public intelligence and statement of facts may pass to the Assembly with equal authenticity through any other conveyance. As to the means, therefore, of giving a direction to measures by the statement of an authorized reporter, this office of intelligence is as nothing.
To consider the French scheme of an executive officer, in its two natural divisions of civil and political. — In the first, it must be observed that, according to the new constitution, the higher parts of judicature, in either of its lines, are not in the king. The king of France is not the fountain of justice. The judges, neither the original nor the appellate, are of his nomination. He neither proposes the candidates, nor has a negative on the choice. He is not even the public prosecutor. He serves only as a notary to authenticate the choice made of the judges in the several districts. By his officers he is to execute their sentence. When we look into the true nature of his authority, he appears to be nothing more than a chief of bum bailiffs, sergeants at mace, catchpoles, jailers, and hangmen. It is impossible to place anything called royalty in a more degrading point of view. A thousand times better had it been for the dignity of this unhappy prince that he had nothing at all to do with the administration of justice, deprived as he is of all that is venerable and all that is consolatory in that function, without power of originating any process, without a power of suspension, mitigation, or pardon. Everything in justice that is vile and odious is thrown upon him. It was not for nothing that the Assembly has been at such pains to remove the stigma from certain offices when they are resolved to place the person who had lately been their king in a situation but one degree above the executioner, and in an office nearly of the same quality. It is not in nature that, situated as the king of the French now is, he can respect himself or can be respected by others.
View this new executive officer on the side of his political capacity, as he acts under the orders of the National Assembly. To execute laws is a royal office; to execute orders is not to be a king. However, a political executive magistracy, though merely such, is a great trust. It is a trust indeed that has much depending upon its faithful and diligent performance, both in the person presiding in it and in all its subordinates. Means of performing this duty ought to be given by regulation; and dispositions toward it ought to be infused by the circumstances attendant on the trust. It ought to be environed with dignity, authority, and consideration, and it ought to lead to glory. The office of execution is an office of exertion. It is not from impotence we are to expect the tasks of power. What sort of person is a king to command executory service, who has no means whatsoever to reward it? Not in a permanent office; not in a grant of land; no, not in a pension of fifty pounds a year; not in the vainest and most trivial title. In France, the king is no more the fountain of honor than he is the fountain of justice. All rewards, all distinctions are in other hands. Those who serve the king can be actuated by no natural motive but fear — by a fear of everything except their master. His functions of internal coercion are as odious as those which he exercises in the department of justice. If relief is to be given to any municipality, the Assembly gives it. If troops are to be sent to reduce them to obedience to the Assembly, the king is to execute the order; and upon every occasion he is to be spattered over with the blood of his people. He has no negative; yet his name and authority is used to enforce every harsh decree. Nay, he must concur in the butchery of those who shall attempt to free him from his imprisonment or show the slightest attachment to his person or to his ancient authority.
Executive magistracy ought to be constituted in such a manner that those who compose it should be disposed to love and to venerate those whom they are bound to obey. A purposed neglect or, what is worse, a literal but perverse and malignant obedience must be the ruin of the wisest counsels. In vain will the law attempt to anticipate or to follow such studied neglects and fraudulent attentions. To make them act zealously is not in the competence of law. Kings, even such as are truly kings, may and ought to bear the freedom of subjects that are obnoxious to them. They may, too, without derogating from themselves, bear even the authority of such persons if it promotes their service. Louis the Thirteenth mortally hated the Cardinal de Richelieu, but his support of that minister against his rivals was the source of all the glory of his reign and the solid foundation of his throne itself. Louis the Fourteenth, when come to the throne, did not love the Cardinal Mazarin, but for his interests he preserved him in power. When old, he detested Louvois, but for years, whilst he faithfully served his greatness, he endured his person. When George the Second took Mr. Pitt, who certainly was not agreeable to him, into his councils, he did nothing which could humble a wise sovereign. But these ministers, who were chosen by affairs, not by affections, acted in the name of, and in trust for, kings, and not as their avowed, constitutional, and ostensible masters. I think it impossible that any king, when he has recovered his first terrors, can cordially infuse vivacity and vigor into measures which he knows to be dictated by those who, he must be persuaded, are in the highest degree ill affected to his person. Will any ministers who serve such a king (or whatever he may be called) with but a decent appearance of respect cordially obey the orders of those whom but the other day in his name they had committed to the Bastille? Will they obey the orders of those whom, whilst they were exercising despotic justice upon them, they conceived they were treating with lenity, and from whom, in a prison, they thought they had provided an asylum? If you expect such obedience amongst your other innovations and regenerations, you ought to make a revolution in nature and provide a new constitution for the human mind. Otherwise, your supreme government cannot harmonize with its executory system. There are cases in which we cannot take up with names and abstractions. You may call half a dozen leading individuals, whom we have reason to fear and hate, the nation. It makes no other difference than to make us fear and hate them the more. If it had been thought justifiable and expedient to make such a revolution by such means, and through such persons, as you have made yours, it would have been more wise to have completed the business of the fifth and sixth of October. The new executive officer would then owe his situation to those who are his creators as well as his masters; and he might be bound in interest, in the society of crime, and (if in crimes there could be virtues) in gratitude to serve those who had promoted him to a place of great lucre and great sensual indulgence, and of something more; for more he must have received from those who certainly would not have limited an aggrandized creature, as they have done a submitting antagonist.
A king circumstanced as the present, if he is totally stupefied by his misfortunes so as to think it not the necessity but the premium and privilege of life to eat and sleep, without any regard to glory, can never be fit for the office. If he feels as men commonly feel, he must be sensible that an office so circumstanced is one in which he can obtain no fame or reputation. He has no generous interest that can excite him to action. At best, his conduct will be passive and defensive. To inferior people such an office might be matter of honor. But to be raised to it, and to descend to it, are different things and suggest different sentiments. Does he really name the ministers? They will have a sympathy with him. Are they forced upon him? The whole business between them and the nominal king will be mutual counteraction. In all other countries, the office of ministers of state is of the highest dignity. In France it is full of peril, and incapable of glory. Rivals, however, they will have in their nothingness, whilst shallow ambition exists in the world, or the desire of a miserable salary is an incentive to short-sighted avarice. Those competitors of the ministers are enabled by your constitution to attack them in their vital parts, whilst they have not the means of repelling their charges in any other than the degrading character of culprits. The ministers of state in France are the only persons in that country who are incapable of a share in the national councils. What ministers! What councils! What a nation! — But they are responsible. It is a poor service that is to be had from responsibility. The elevation of mind to be derived from fear will never make a nation glorious. Responsibility prevents crimes. It makes all attempts against the laws dangerous. But for a principle of active and zealous service, none but idiots could think of it. Is the conduct of a war to be trusted to a man who may abhor its principle, who, in every step he may take to render it successful, confirms the power of those by whom he is oppressed? Will foreign states seriously treat with him who has no prerogative of peace or war? No, not so much as in a single vote by himself or his ministers, or by any one whom he can possibly influence. A state of contempt is not a state for a prince; better get rid of him at once.
I know it will be said that these humors in the court and executive government will continue only through this generation, and that the king has been brought to declare the dauphin shall be educated in a conformity to his situation. If he is made to conform to his situation, he will have no education at all. His training must be worse, even, than that of an arbitrary monarch. If he reads — whether he reads or not — some good or evil genius will tell him his ancestors were kings. Thenceforward his object must be to assert himself and to avenge his parents. This you will say is not his duty. That may be; but it is nature; and whilst you pique nature against you, you do unwisely to trust to duty. In this futile scheme of polity, the state nurses in its bosom, for the present, a source of weakness, perplexity, counteraction, inefficiency, and decay; and it prepares the means of its final ruin. In short, I see nothing in the executive force (I cannot call it authority) that has even an appearance of vigor, or that has the smallest degree of just correspondence or symmetry, or amicable relation with the supreme power, either as it now exists or as it is planned for the future government.
You have settled, by an economy as perverted as the policy, two establishments of government — one real, one fictitious. Both maintained at a vast expense, but the fictitious at, I think, the greatest. Such a machine as the latter is not worth the grease of its wheels. The expense is exorbitant, and neither the show nor the use deserve the tenth part of the charge. Oh! but I don't do justice to the talents of the legislators: I don't allow, as I ought to do, for necessity. Their scheme of executive force was not their choice. This pageant must be kept. The people would not consent to part with it. Right; I understand you. You do, in spite of your grand theories, to which you would have heaven and earth to bend — you do know how to conform yourselves to the nature and circumstances of things. But when you were obliged to conform thus far to circumstances, you ought to have carried your submission further, and to have made, what you were obliged to take, a proper instrument, and useful to its end.
That was in your power. For instance, among many others, it was in your power to leave to your king the right of peace and war. What! to leave to the executive magistrate the most dangerous of all prerogatives? I know none more dangerous, nor any one more necessary to be so trusted. I do not say that this prerogative ought to be trusted to your king unless he enjoyed other auxiliary trusts along with it, which he does not now hold. But if he did possess them, hazardous as they are undoubtedly, advantages would arise from such a constitution, more than compensating the risk. There is no other way of keeping the several potentates of Europe from intriguing distinctly and personally with the members of your Assembly, from intermeddling in all your concerns, and fomenting, in the heart of your country, the most pernicious of all factions — factions in the interest and under the direction of foreign powers. From that worst of evils, thank God, we are still free. Your skill, if you had any, would be well employed to find out indirect correctives and controls upon this perilous trust. If you did not like those which in England we have chosen, your leaders might have exerted their abilities in contriving better. If it were necessary to exemplify the consequences of such an executive government as yours, in the management of great affairs, I should refer you to the late reports of M. de Montmorin to the National Assembly, and all the other proceedings relative to the differences between Great Britain and Spain. It would be treating your understanding with disrespect to point them out to you.
I hear that the persons who are called ministers have signified an intention of resigning their places. I am rather astonished that they have not resigned long since. For the universe I would not have stood in the situation in which they have been for this last twelvemonth. They wished well, I take it for granted, to the revolution. Let this fact be as it may, they could not, placed as they were upon an eminence, though an eminence of humiliation, but be the first to see collectively, and to feel each in his own department, the evils which have been produced by that revolution. In every step which they took, or forbore to take, they must have felt the degraded situation of their country and their utter incapacity of serving it. They are in a species of subordinate servitude, in which no men before them were ever seen. Without confidence from their sovereign, on whom they were forced, or from the Assembly, who forced them upon him, all the noble functions of their office are executed by committees of the Assembly without any regard whatsoever to their personal or their official authority. They are to execute, without power; they are to be responsible, without discretion; they are to deliberate, without choice. In their puzzled situations, under two sovereigns, over neither of whom they have any influence, they must act in such a manner as (in effect, whatever they may intend) sometimes to betray the one, sometimes the other, and always to betray themselves. Such has been their situation, such must be the situation of those who succeed them. I have much respect and many good wishes for M. Necker. I am obliged to him for attentions. I thought, when his enemies had driven him from Versailles, that his exile was a subject of most serious congratulations — sed multae urbes et publica vota vicerunt. He is now sitting on the ruins of the finances and of the monarchy of France.
A great deal more might be observed on the strange constitution of the executory part of the new government, but fatigue must give bounds to the discussion of subjects which in themselves have hardly any limits.
AS little genius and talent am I able to perceive in the plan of judicature formed by the National Assembly. According to their invariable course, the framers of your constitution have begun with the utter abolition of the parliaments. These venerable bodies, like the rest of the old government, stood in need of reform, even though there should be no change made in the monarchy. They required several more alterations to adapt them to the system of a free constitution. But they had particulars in their constitution, and those not a few, which deserved approbation from the wise. They possessed one fundamental excellence: they were independent. The most doubtful circumstance attendant on their office, that of its being vendible, contributed however to this independence of character. They held for life. Indeed, they may be said to have held by inheritance. Appointed by the monarch, they were considered as nearly out of his power. The most determined exertions of that authority against them only showed their radical independence. They composed permanent bodies politic, constituted to resist arbitrary innovation; and from that corporate constitution, and from most of their forms, they were well calculated to afford both certainty and stability to the laws. They had been a safe asylum to secure these laws in all the revolutions of humor and opinion. They had saved that sacred deposit of the country during the reigns of arbitrary princes and the struggles of arbitrary factions. They kept alive the memory and record of the constitution. They were the great security to private property which might be said (when personal liberty had no existence) to be, in fact, as well guarded in France as in any other country. Whatever is supreme in a state ought to have, as much as possible, its judicial authority so constituted as not only not to depend upon it, but in some sort to balance it. It ought to give a security to its justice against its power. It ought to make its judicature, as it were, something exterior to the state.
These parliaments had furnished, not the best certainly, but some considerable corrective to the excesses and vices of the monarchy. Such an independent judicature was ten times more necessary when a democracy became the absolute power of the country. In that constitution, elective temporary, local judges, such as you have contrived, exercising their dependent functions in a narrow society, must be the worst of all tribunals. In them it will be vain to look for any appearance of justice toward strangers, toward the obnoxious rich, toward the minority of routed parties, toward all those who in the election have supported unsuccessful candidates. It will be impossible to keep the new tribunals clear of the worst spirit of faction. All contrivances by ballot we know experimentally to be vain and childish to prevent a discovery of inclinations. Where they may the best answer the purposes of concealment, they answer to produce suspicion, and this is a still more mischievous cause of partiality.
If the parliaments had been preserved, instead of being dissolved at so ruinous a charge to the nation, they might have served in this new commonwealth, perhaps not precisely the same (I do not mean an exact parallel), but nearly the same, purposes as the court and senate of Areopagus did in Athens; that is, as one of the balances and correctives to the evils of a light and unjust democracy. Every one knows that this tribunal was the great stay of that state; every one knows with what care it was upheld, and with what a religious awe it was consecrated. The parliaments were not wholly free from faction, I admit; but this evil was exterior and accidental, and not so much the vice of their constitution itself, as it must be in your new contrivance of sexennial elective judicatories. Several English commend the abolition of the old tribunals, as supposing that they determined everything by bribery and corruption. But they have stood the test of monarchic and republican scrutiny. The court was well disposed to prove corruption on those bodies when the were dissolved in 1771. Those who have again dissolved them would have done the same if they could, but both inquisitions having failed, I conclude that gross pecuniary corruption must have been rather rare amongst them.
It would have been prudent, along with the parliaments, to preserve their ancient power of registering, and of remonstrating at least upon, all the decrees of the National Assembly, as they did upon those which passed in the time of the monarchy. It would be a means of squaring the occasional decrees of a democracy to some principles of general jurisprudence. The vice of the ancient democracies, and one cause of their ruin, was that they ruled, as you do, by occasional decrees, psephismata. This practice soon broke in upon the tenor and consistency of the laws; it abated the respect of the people toward them, and totally destroyed them in the end.
Your vesting the power of remonstrance, which, in the time of the monarchy, existed in the parliament of Paris, in your principal executive officer, whom, in spite of common sense, you persevere in calling king, is the height of absurdity. You ought never to suffer remonstrance from him who is to execute. This is to understand neither council nor execution, neither authority nor obedience. The person whom you call king ought not to have this power, or he ought to have more.
Your present arrangement is strictly judicial. Instead of imitating your monarchy and seating your judges on a bench of independence, your object is to reduce them to the most blind obedience. As you have changed all things, you have invented new principles of order. You first appoint judges, who, I suppose, are to determine according to law, and then you let them know that, at some time or other, you intend to give them some law by which they are to determine. Any studies which they have made (if any they have made) are to be useless to them. But to supply these studies, they are to be sworn to obey all the rules, orders, and instructions which from time to time they are to receive from the National Assembly. These if they submit to, they leave no ground of law to the subject. They become complete and most dangerous instruments in the hands of the governing power which, in the midst of a cause or on the prospect of it, may wholly change the rule of decision. If these orders of the National Assembly come to be contrary to the will of the people, who locally choose judges, such confusion must happen as is terrible to think of. For the judges owe their places to the local authority, and the commands they are sworn to obey come from those who have no share in their appointment. In the meantime they have the example of the court of Chatelet to encourage and guide them in the exercise of their functions. That court is to try criminals sent to it by the National Assembly, or brought before it by other courses of delation. They sit under a guard to save their own lives. They know not by what law they judge, nor under what authority they act, nor by what tenure they hold. It is thought that they are sometimes obliged to condemn at peril of their lives. This is not perhaps certain, nor can it be ascertained; but when they acquit, we know they have seen the persons whom they discharge, with perfect impunity to the actors, hanged at the door of their court.
The Assembly indeed promises that they will form a body of law, which shall be short, simple, clear, and so forth. That is, by their short laws they will leave much to the discretion of the judge, whilst they have exploded the authority of all the learning which could make judicial discretion (a thing perilous at best) deserving the appellation of a sound discretion.
It is curious to observe that the administrative bodies are carefully exempted from the jurisdiction of these new tribunals. That is, those persons are exempted from the power of the laws who ought to be the most entirely submitted to them. Those who execute public pecuniary trusts ought of all men to be the most strictly held to their duty. One would have thought that it must have been among your earliest cares, if you did not mean that those administrative bodies should be real, sovereign, independent states, to form an awful tribunal, like your late parliaments, or like our king's bench, where all corporate officers might obtain protection in the legal exercise of their functions, and would find coercion if they trespassed against their legal duty. But the cause of the exemption is plain. These administrative bodies are the great instruments of the present leaders in their progress through democracy to oligarchy. They must, therefore, be put above the law. It will be said that the legal tribunals which you have made are unfit to coerce them. They are, undoubtedly. They are unfit for any rational purpose. It will be said, too, that the administrative bodies will be accountable to the General Assembly. This I fear is talking without much consideration of the nature of that Assembly, or of these corporations. However, to be subject to the pleasure of that Assembly is not to be subject to law either for protection or for constraint.
This establishment of judges as yet wants something to its completion. It is to be crowned by a new tribunal. This is to be a grand state judicature, and it is to judge of crimes committed against the nation, that is, against the power of the Assembly. It seems as if they had something in their view of the nature of the high court of justice erected in England during the time of the great usurpation. As they have not yet finished this part of the scheme, it is impossible to form a right judgment upon it. However, if great care is not taken to form it in a spirit very different from that which has guided them in their proceedings relative to state offenses, this tribunal, subservient to their inquisition, the Committee of Research, will extinguish the last sparks of liberty in France and settle the most dreadful and arbitrary tyranny ever known in any nation. If they wish to give to this tribunal any appearance of liberty and justice, they must not evoke from or send to it the causes relative to their own members, at their pleasure. They must also remove the seat of that tribunal out of the republic of Paris.
HAS more wisdom been displayed in the constitution of your army than what is discoverable in your plan of judicature? The able arrangement of this part is the more difficult, and requires the greatest skill and attention, not only as the great concern in itself, but as it is the third cementing principle in the new body of republics which you call the French nation. Truly it is not easy to divine what that army may become at last. You have voted a very large one, and on good appointments, at least fully equal to your apparent means of payment. But what is the principle of its discipline, or whom is it to obey? You have got the wolf by the ears, and I wish you joy of the happy position in which you have chosen to place yourselves, and in which you are well circumstanced for a free deliberation relatively to that army or to anything else.
The minister and secretary of state for the war department is M. de la Tour du Pin. This gentleman, like his colleagues in administration, is a most zealous assertor of the revolution, and a sanguine admirer of the new constitution which originated in that event. His statement of facts, relative to the military of France, is important, not only from his official and personal authority, but because it displays very clearly the actual condition of the army in France, and because it throws light on the principles upon which the Assembly proceeds in the administration of this critical object. It may enable us to form some judgment how far it may be expedient in this country to imitate the martial policy of France.
M. de la Tour du Pin, on the fourth of last June, comes to give an account of the state of his department as it exists under the auspices of the National Assembly. No man knows it so well; no man can express it better. Addressing himself to the National Assembly, he says
   His Majesty has this day sent me to apprise you of the multiplied disorders of
   which every day he receives the most distressing intelligence. The army (le
   corps militaire) threatens to fall into the most turbulent anarchy. Entire
   regiments have dared to violate at once the respect due to the laws, to the
   king, to the order established by your decrees, and to the oaths which they
   have taken with the most awful solemnity. Compelled by my duty to give you
   information of these excesses, my heart bleeds when I consider who they are
   that have committed them. Those against whom it is not in my power to
   withhold the most grievous complaints are a part of that very soldiery which to
   this day have been so full of honor and loyalty, and with whom, for fifty years, I
   have lived the comrade and the friend.
   What incomprehensible spirit of delirium and delusion has all at once led them
   astray? Whilst you are indefatigable in establishing uniformity in the empire,
   and molding the whole into one coherent and consistent body; whilst the
   French are taught by you at once the respect which the laws owe to the rights
   of man, and that which the citizens owe to the laws, the administration of the
   army presents nothing but disturbance and confusion. I see in more than one
   corps the bonds of discipline relaxed or broken; the most unheard-of
   pretensions avowed directly and without any disguise; the ordinances
   without force; the chiefs without authority; the military chest and the
   colors carried off; the authority of the king himself (risum teneatis?) proudly
   defied; the officers despised, degraded, threatened, driven away, and some of
   them prisoners in the midst of their corps, dragging on a precarious life
   in the bosom of disgust and humiliation. To fill up the measure of all
   these horrors, the commandants of places have had their throats cut,
   under the eyes and almost in the arms of their own soldiers.
   These evils are great; but they are not the worst consequences which may be
   produced by such military insurrections. Sooner or later they may menace the
   nation itself. The nature of things requires that the army should never act
   but as an instrument. The moment that, erecting itself into a deliberative
   body, it shall act according to its own resolutions, the government, be it
   what it may, will immediately degenerate into a military democracy — a species
   of political monster which has always ended by devouring those who have
   produced it.
   After all this, who must not be alarmed at the irregular consultations and
   turbulent committees formed in some regiments by the common soldiers and
   non-commissioned officers without the knowledge, or even in contempt of the
   authority, of their superiors, although the presence and concurrence of those
   superiors could give no authority to such monstrous democratic assemblies
   (comices).
It is not necessary to add much to this finished picture — finished as far as its canvas admits, but, as I apprehend, not taking in the whole of the nature and complexity of the disorders of this military democracy which, the minister at war truly and wisely observes, wherever it exists must be the true constitution of the state, by whatever formal appellation it may pass. For though he informs the Assembly that the more considerable part of the army have not cast off their obedience, but are still attached to their duty, yet those travelers who have seen the corps whose conduct is the best rather observe in them the absence of mutiny than the existence of discipline.
I cannot help pausing here for a moment to reflect upon the expressions of surprise which this minister has let fall, relative to the excesses he relates. To him the departure of the troops from their ancient principles of loyalty and honor seems quite inconceivable. Surely those to whom he addresses himself know the causes of it but too well. They know the doctrines which they have preached, the decrees which they have passed, the practices which they have countenanced. The soldiers remember the 6th of October. They recollect the French guards. They have not forgotten the taking of the king's castles in Paris and Marseilles. That the governors in both places were murdered with impunity is a fact that has not passed out of their minds. They do not abandon the principles laid down so ostentatiously and laboriously of the equality of men. They cannot shut their eyes to the degradation of the whole noblesse of France and the suppression of the very idea of a gentleman. The total abolition of titles and distinctions is not lost upon them. But M. de la Tour du Pin is astonished at their disloyalty, when the doctors of the Assembly have taught them at the same time the respect due to laws. It is easy to judge which of the two sorts of lessons men with arms in their hands are likely to learn. As to the authority of the king, we may collect from the minister himself (if any argument on that head were not quite superfluous) that it is not of more consideration with these troops than it is with everybody else. ""The king"", says he, ""has over and over again repeated his orders to put a stop to these excesses; but in so terrible a crisis your (the Assembly's) concurrence is become indispensably necessary to prevent the evils which menace the state. You unite to the force of the legislative power that of opinion still more important"". To be sure the army can have no opinion of the power or authority of the king. Perhaps the soldier has by this time learned that the Assembly itself does not enjoy a much greater degree of liberty than that royal figure.
It is now to be seen what has been proposed in this exigency, one of the greatest that can happen in a state. The minister requests the Assembly to array itself in all its terrors, and to call forth all its majesty. He desires that the grave and severe principles announced by them may give vigor to the king's proclamation. After this we should have looked for courts, civil and martial, breaking of some corps, decimating of others, and all the terrible means which necessity has employed in such cases to arrest the progress of the most terrible of all evils; particularly, one might expect that a serious inquiry would be made into the murder of commandants in the view of their soldiers. Not one word of all this or of anything like it. After they had been told that the soldiery trampled upon the decrees of the Assembly promulgated by the king, the Assembly pass new decrees, and they authorize the king to make new proclamations. After the secretary at war had stated that the regiments had paid no regard to oaths pretes avec la plus imposante solemnite, they propose — what? More oaths. They renew decrees and proclamations as they experience their insufficiency, and they multiply oaths in proportion as they weaken in the minds of men, the sanctions of religion. I hope that handy abridgments of the excellent sermons of Voltaire, d'Alembert, Diderot, and Helvetius, on the Immortality of the Soul, on a particular superintending Providence, and on a Future State of Rewards and Punishments are sent down to the soldiers along with their civic oaths. Of this I have no doubt; as I understand that a certain description of reading makes no inconsiderable part of their military exercises, and that they are full as well supplied with the ammunition of pamphlets as of cartridges.
To prevent the mischiefs arising from conspiracies, irregular consultations, seditious committees, and monstrous democratic assemblies (comitia, comices) of the soldiers, and all the disorders arising from idleness, luxury, dissipation, and insubordination, I believe the most astonishing means have been used that ever occurred to men, even in all the inventions of this prolific age. It is no less than this: the king has promulgated in circular letters to all the regiments his direct authority and encouragement that the several corps should join themselves with the clubs and confederations in the several municipalities, and mix with them in their feasts and civic entertainments! This jolly discipline, it seems, is to soften the ferocity of their minds, to reconcile them to their bottle companions of other descriptions, and to merge particular conspiracies in more general associations That this remedy would be pleasing to the soldiers, as they are described by M. de la Tour du Pin, I can readily believe; and that, however mutinous otherwise, they will dutifully submit themselves to these royal proclamations. But I should question whether all this civic swearing, clubbing, and feasting would dispose them, more than at present they are disposed, to an obedience to their officers, or teach them better to submit to the austere rules of military discipline. It will make them admirable citizens after the French mode, but not quite so good soldiers after any mode. A doubt might well arise whether the conversations at these good tables would fit them a great deal the better for the character of mere instruments, which this veteran officer and statesman justly observes the nature of things always requires an army to be.
Concerning the likelihood of this improvement in discipline by the free conversation of the soldiers with municipal festive societies, which is thus officially encouraged by royal authority and sanction, we may judge by the state of the municipalities themselves, furnished to us by the war minister in this very speech. He conceives good hopes of the success of his endeavors toward restoring order for the present from the good disposition of certain regiments, but he finds something cloudy with regard to the future. As to preventing the return of confusion, for this the administration (says he) cannot be answerable to you as long as they see the municipalities arrogate to themselves an authority over the troops which your institutions have reserved wholly to the monarch. You have fixed the limits of the military authority and the municipal authority. You have bounded the action which you have permitted to the latter over the former to the right of requisition, but never did the letter or the spirit of your decrees authorize the commons in these municipalities to break the officers, to try them, to give orders to the soldiers, to drive them from the posts committed to their guard, to stop them in their marches ordered by the king, or, in a word, to enslave the troops to the caprice of each of the cities or even market towns through which they are to pass.
Such is the character and disposition of the municipal society which is to reclaim the soldiery, to bring them back to the true principles of military subordination, and to render them machines in the hands of the supreme power of the country! Such are the distempers of the French troops! Such is their cure! As the army is, so is the navy. The municipalities supersede the orders of the Assembly, and the seamen in their turn supersede the orders of the municipalities. From my heart I pity the condition of a respectable servant of the public like this war minister, obliged in his old age to pledge the Assembly in their civic cups, and to enter with a hoary head into all the fantastic vagaries of these juvenile politicians. Such schemes are not like propositions coming from a man of fifty years' wear and tear amongst mankind. They seem rather such as ought to be expected from those grand compounders in politics who shorten the road to their degrees in the state and have a certain inward fanatical assurance and illumination upon all subjects, upon the credit of which one of their doctors has thought fit, with great applause, and greater success, to caution the Assembly not to attend to old men or to any persons who valued themselves upon their experience. I suppose all the ministers of state must qualify and take this test — wholly abjuring the errors and heresies of experience and observation. Every man has his own relish. But I think if I could not attain to the wisdom, I would at least preserve something of the stiff and peremptory dignity of age. These gentlemen deal in regeneration; but at any price I should hardly yield my rigid fibers to be regenerated by them, nor begin, in my grand climacteric, to squall in their new accents or to stammer, in my second cradle, the elemental sounds of their barbarous metaphysics. Si isti mihi largiantur ut repuerascam, et in eorum cunis vagiam, valde recusem!
The imbecility of any part of the puerile and pedantic system, which they call a constitution, cannot be laid open without discovering the utter insufficiency and mischief of every other part with which it comes in contact, or that bears any the remotest relation to it. You cannot propose a remedy for the incompetence of the crown without displaying the debility of the Assembly. You cannot deliberate on the confusion of the army of the state without disclosing the worse disorders of the armed municipalities. The military lays open the civil, and the civil betrays the military, anarchy. I wish everybody carefully to peruse the eloquent speech (such it is) of M. de la Tour du Pin. He attributes the salvation of the municipalities to the good behavior of some of the troops. These troops are to preserve the well-disposed part of those municipalities, which is confessed to be the weakest, from the pillage of the worst-disposed, which is the strongest. But the municipalities affect a sovereignty and will command those troops which are necessary for their protection. Indeed they must command them or court them. The municipalities, by the necessity of their situation, and by the republican powers they have obtained, must, with relation to the military, be the masters, or the servants, or the confederates, or each successively; or they must make a jumble of all together, according to circumstances. What government is there to coerce the army but the municipality, or the municipality but the army? To preserve concord where authority is extinguished, at the hazard of all consequences, the Assembly attempts to cure the distempers by the distempers themselves; and they hope to preserve themselves from a purely military democracy by giving it a debauched interest in the municipal.
If the soldiers once come to mix for any time in the municipal clubs, cabals, and confederacies, an elective attraction will draw them to the lowest and most desperate part. With them will be their habits, affections, and sympathies. The military conspiracies, which are to be remedied by civic confederacies; the rebellious municipalities, which are to be rendered obedient by furnishing them with the means of seducing the very armies of the state that are to keep them in order; all these chimeras of a monstrous and portentous policy must aggravate the confusion from which they have arisen. There must be blood. The want of common judgment manifested in the construction of all their descriptions of forces and in all their kinds of civil and judicial authorities will make it flow. Disorders may be quieted in one time and in one part. They will break out in others, because the evil is radical and intrinsic. All these schemes of mixing mutinous soldiers with seditious citizens must weaken still more and more the military connection of soldiers with their officers, as well as add military and mutinous audacity to turbulent artificers and peasants. To secure a real army, the officer should be first and last in the eye of the soldier; first and last in his attention, observance, and esteem. Officers it seems there are to be, whose chief qualification must be temper and patience. They are to manage their troops by electioneering arts. They must bear themselves as candidates, not as commanders. But as by such means power may be occasionally in their hands, the authority by which they are to be nominated becomes of high importance.
What you may do finally does not appear, nor is it of much moment whilst the strange and contradictory relation between your army and all the parts of your republic, as well as the puzzled relation of those parts to each other and to the whole, remain as they are. You seem to have given the provisional nomination of the officers in the first instance to the king, with a reserve of approbation by the National Assembly. Men who have an interest to pursue are extremely sagacious in discovering the true seat of power. They must soon perceive that those who can negative indefinitely in reality appoint. The officers must, therefore, look to their intrigues in that Assembly as the sole certain road to promotion. Still, however, by your new constitution they must begin their solicitation at court. This double negotiation for military rank seems to me a contrivance as well adapted, as if it were studied for no other end, to promote faction in the Assembly itself, relative to this vast military patronage, and then to poison the corps of officers with factions of a nature still more dangerous to the safety of government, upon any bottom on which it can be placed, and destructive in the end to the efficiency of the army itself. Those officers who lose the promotions intended for them by the crown must become of a faction opposite to that of the Assembly, which has rejected their claims, and must nourish discontents in the heart of the army against the ruling powers. Those officers, on the other hand, who, by carrying their point through an interest in the Assembly, feel themselves to be at best only second in the good will of the crown, though first in that of the Assembly, must slight an authority which would not advance and could not retard their promotion. If to avoid these evils you will have no other rule for command or promotion than seniority, you will have an army of formality; at the same time it will become more independent and more of a military republic. Not they, but the king is the machine. A king is not to be deposed by halves. If he is not everything in the command of an army, he is nothing. What is the effect of a power placed nominally at the head of the army who to that army is no object of gratitude or of fear? Such a cipher is not fit for the administration of an object, of all things the most delicate, the supreme command of military men. They must be constrained (and their inclinations lead them to what their necessities require) by a real, vigorous, effective, decided, personal authority. The authority of the Assembly itself suffers by passing through such a debilitating channel as they have chosen. The army will not long look to an assembly acting through the organ of false show and palpable imposition. They will not seriously yield obedience to a prisoner. They will either despise a pageant, or they will pity a captive king. This relation of your army to the crown will, if I am not greatly mistaken, become a serious dilemma in your politics.
It is, besides, to be considered whether an assembly like yours, even supposing that it was in possession of another sort of organ through which its orders were to pass, is fit for promoting the obedience and discipline of an army. It is known that armies have hitherto yielded a very precarious and uncertain obedience to any senate or popular authority; and they will least of all yield it to an assembly which is only to have a continuance of two years. The officers must totally lose the characteristic disposition of military men if they see with perfect submission and due admiration the dominion of pleaders; especially when they find that they have a new court to pay to an endless succession of those pleaders, whose military policy, and the genius of whose command (if they should have any), must be as uncertain as their duration is transient. In the weakness of one kind of authority, and in the fluctuation of all, the officers of an army will remain for some time mutinous and full of faction until some popular general, who understands the art of conciliating the soldiery, and who possesses the true spirit of command, shall draw the eyes of all men upon himself. Armies will obey him on his personal account. There is no other way of securing military obedience in this state of things. But the moment in which that event shall happen, the person who really commands the army is your master — the master (that is little) of your king, the master of your Assembly, the master of your whole republic.
How came the Assembly by their present power over the army? Chiefly, to be sure, by debauching the soldiers from their officers. They have begun by a most terrible operation. They have touched the central point about which the particles that compose armies are at repose. They have destroyed the principle of obedience in the great, essential, critical link between the officer and the soldier, just where the chain of military subordination commences and on which the whole of that system depends. The soldier is told he is a citizen and has the rights of man and citizen. The right of a man, he is told, is to be his own governor and to be ruled only by those to whom he delegates that self-government. It is very natural he should think that he ought most of all to have his choice where he is to yield the greatest degree of obedience. He will therefore, in all probability, systematically do what he does at present occasionally; that is, he will exercise at least a negative in the choice of his officers. At present the officers are known at best to be only permissive, and on their good behavior. In fact, there have been many instances in which they have been cashiered by their corps. Here is a second negative on the choice of the king — a negative as effectual at least as the other of the Assembly. The soldiers know already that it has been a question, not ill received in the National Assembly, whether they ought not to have the direct choice of their officers, or some proportion of them? When such matters are in deliberation it is no extravagant supposition that they will incline to the opinion most favorable to their pretensions. They will not bear to be deemed the army of an imprisoned king whilst another army in the same country, with whom, too, they are to feast and confederate, is to be considered as the free army of a free constitution. They will cast their eyes on the other and more permanent army; I mean the municipal. That corps, they well know, does actually elect its own officers. They may not be able to discern the grounds of distinction on which they are not to elect a Marquis de la Fayette (or what is his new name?) of their own. If this election of a commander-in-chief be a part of the rights of men, why not of theirs? They see elective justices of peace, elective judges, elective curates, elective bishops, elective municipalities, and elective commanders of the Parisian army — why should they alone be excluded? Are the brave troops of France the only men in that nation who are not the fit judges of military merit and of the qualifications necessary for a commander-in-chief? Are they paid by the state and do they, therefore, lose the rights of men? They are a part of that nation themselves and contribute to that pay. And is not the king, is not the National Assembly, and are not all who elect the National Assembly, likewise paid? Instead of seeing all these forfeit their rights by their receiving a salary, they perceive that in all these cases a salary is given for the exercise of those rights. All your resolutions, all your proceedings, all your debates, all the works of your doctors in religion and politics have industriously been put into their hands, and you expect that they will apply to their own case just as much of your doctrines and examples as suits your pleasure.
EVERYTHING depends upon the army in such a government as yours, for you have industriously destroyed all the opinions and prejudices and, as far as in you lay, all the instincts which support government. Therefore, the moment any difference arises between your National Assembly and any part of the nation, you must have recourse to force. Nothing else is left to you, or rather you have left nothing else to yourselves. You see, by the report of your war minister, that the distribution of the army is in a great measure made with a view of internal coercion. You must rule by an army; and you have infused into that army by which you rule, as well as into the whole body of the nation, principles which after a time must disable you in the use you resolve to make of it. The king is to call out troops to act against his people, when the world has been told, and the assertion is still ringing in our ears, that troops ought not to fire on citizens. The colonies assert to themselves an independent constitution and a free trade. They must be constrained by troops. In what chapter of your code of the rights of men are they able to read that it is a part of the rights of men to have their commerce monopolized and restrained for the benefit of others? As the colonists rise on you, the Negroes rise on them. Troops again — massacre, torture, hanging! These are your rights of men! These are the fruits of metaphysic declarations wantonly made, and shamefully retracted! It was but the other day that the farmers of land in one of your provinces refused to pay some sort of rents to the lord of the soil. In consequence of this, you decree that the country people shall pay all rents and dues, except those which as grievances you have abolished; and if they refuse, then you order the king to march troops against them. You lay down metaphysic propositions which infer universal consequences, and then you attempt to limit logic by despotism. The leaders of the present system tell them of their rights, as men, to take fortresses, to murder guards, to seize on kings without the least appearance of authority even from the Assembly, whilst, as the sovereign legislative body, that Assembly was sitting in the name of the nation — and yet these leaders presume to order out the troops which have acted in these very disorders, to coerce those who shall judge on the principles, and follow the examples, which have been guaranteed by their own approbation.
The leaders teach the people to abhor and reject all feudality as the barbarism of tyranny, and they tell them afterwards how much of that barbarous tyranny they are to bear with patience. As they are prodigal of light with regard to grievances, so the people find them sparing in the extreme with regard to redress. They know that not only certain quitrents and personal duties, which you have permitted them to redeem (but have furnished no money for the redemption), are as nothing to those burdens for which you have made no provision at all. They know that almost the whole system of landed property in its origin is feudal; that it is the distribution of the possessions of the original proprietors, made by a barbarous conqueror to his barbarous instruments; and that the most grievous effects of the conquest are the land rents of every kind, as without question they are.
The peasants, in all probability, are the descendants of these ancient proprietors, Romans or Gauls. But if they fail, in any degree, in the titles which they make on the principles of antiquaries and lawyers, they retreat into the citadel of the rights of men. There they find that men are equal; and the earth, the kind and equal mother of all, ought not to be monopolized to foster the pride and luxury of any men, who by nature are no better than themselves, and who, if they do not labor for their bread, are worse. They find that by the laws of nature the occupant and subduer of the soil is the true proprietor; that there is no prescription against nature; and that the agreements (where any there are) which have been made with the landlords, during the time of slavery, are only the effect of duress and force; and that when the people reentered into the rights of men, those agreements were made as void as everything else which had been settled under the prevalence of the old feudal and aristocratic tyranny. They will tell you that they see no difference between an idler with a hat and a national cockade and an idler in a cowl or in a rochet. If you ground the title to rents on succession and prescription, they tell you from the speech of M. Camus, published by the National Assembly for their information, that things ill begun cannot avail themselves of prescription; that the title of these lords was vicious in its origin; and that force is at least as bad as fraud. As to the title by succession, they will tell you that the succession of those who have cultivated the soil is the true pedigree of property, and not rotten parchments and silly substitutions; that the lords have enjoyed their usurpation too long; and that if they allow to these lay monks any charitable pension, they ought to be thankful to the bounty of the true proprietor, who is so generous toward a false claimant to his goods.
When the peasants give you back that coin of sophistic reason on which you have set your image and superscription, you cry it down as base money and tell them you will pay for the future with French guards, and dragoons, and hussars. You hold up, to chastise them, the second-hand authority of a king, who is only the instrument of destroying, without any power of protecting either the people or his own person. Through him it seems you will make yourselves obeyed. They answer: You have taught us that there are no gentlemen, and which of your principles teach us to bow to kings whom we have not elected? We know without your teaching that lands were given for the support of feudal dignities, feudal titles, and feudal offices. When you took down the cause as a grievance, why should the more grievous effect remain? As there are now no hereditary honors, and no distinguished families, why are we taxed to maintain what you tell us ought not to exist? You have sent down our old aristocratic landlords in no other character, and with no other title, but that of exactors under your authority. Have you endeavored to make these your rent-gatherers respectable to us? No. You have sent them to us with their arms reversed, their shields broken, their impresses defaced; and so displumed, degraded, and metamorphosed, such unfeathered two-legged things, that we no longer know them. They are strangers to us. They do not even go by the names of our ancient lords. Physically they may be the same men, though we are not quite sure of that, on your new philosophic doctrines of personal identity. In all other respects they are totally changed. We do not see why we have not as good a right to refuse them their rents as you have to abrogate all their honors, titles, and distinctions. This we have never commissioned you to do; and it is one instance, among many indeed, of your assumption of undelegated power. We see the burghers of Paris, through their clubs, their mobs, and their national guards, directing you at their pleasure and giving that as law to you which, under your authority, is transmitted as law to us. Through you these burghers dispose of the lives and fortunes of us all. Why should not you attend as much to the desires of the laborious husbandman with regard to our rent, by which we are affected in the most serious manner, as you do to the demands of these insolent burghers, relative to distinctions and titles of honor, by which neither they nor we are affected at all? But we find you pay more regard to their fancies than to our necessities. Is it among the rights of man to pay tribute to his equals? Before this measure of yours, we might have thought we were not perfectly equal. We might have entertained some old, habitual, unmeaning prepossession in favor of those landlords; but we cannot conceive with what other view than that of destroying all respect to them, you could have made the law that degrades them. You have forbidden us to treat them with any of the old formalities of respect, and now you send troops to saber and to bayonet us into a submission to fear and force, which you did not suffer us to yield to the mild authority of opinion.
The ground of some of these arguments is horrid and ridiculous to all rational ears, but to the politicians of metaphysics who have opened schools for sophistry and made establishments for anarchy, it is solid and conclusive. It is obvious that, on a mere consideration of the right, the leaders in the Assembly would not in the least have scrupled to abrogate the rents along with the title and family ensigns. It would be only to follow up the principle of their reasonings and to complete the analogy of their conduct. But they had newly possessed themselves of a great body of landed property by confiscation. They had this commodity at market; and the market would have been wholly destroyed if they were to permit the husbandmen to riot in the speculations with which they so freely intoxicated themselves. The only security which property enjoys in any one of its descriptions is from the interests of their rapacity with regard to some other. They have left nothing but their own arbitrary pleasure to determine what property is to be protected and what subverted.
Neither have they left any principle by which any of their municipalities can be bound to obedience, or even conscientiously obliged not to separate from the whole to become independent, or to connect itself with some other state. The people of Lyons, it seems, have refused lately to pay taxes. Why should they not? What lawful authority is there left to exact them? The king imposed some of them. The old states, methodized by orders, settled the more ancient. They may say to the Assembly: who are you, that are not our kings, nor the states we have elected, nor sit on the principles on which we have elected you? And who are we, that when we see the gabelles, which you have ordered to be paid, wholly shaken off, when we see the act of disobedience afterwards ratified by yourselves — who are we, that we are not to judge what taxes we ought or ought not to pay, and are not to avail ourselves of the same powers, the validity of which you have approved in others? To this the answer is, We will send troops. The last reason of kings is always the first with your Assembly. This military aid may serve for a time, whilst the impression of the increase of pay remains, and the vanity of being umpires in all disputes is flattered. But this weapon will snap short, unfaithful to the hand that employs it. The Assembly keep a school where, systematically, and with unremitting perseverance, they teach principles and form regulations destructive to all spirit of subordination, civil and military — and then they expect that they shall hold in obedience an anarchic people by an anarchic army.
The municipal army which, according to the new policy, is to balance this national army, if considered in itself only, is of a constitution much more simple, and in every respect less exceptionable. It is a mere democratic body, unconnected with the crown or the kingdom, armed and trained and officered at the pleasure of the districts to which the corps severally belong, and the personal service of the individuals who compose, or the fine in lieu of personal service, are directed by the same authority.Nothing is more uniform. If, however, considered in any relation to the crown, to the National Assembly, to the public tribunals, or to the other army, or considered in a view to any coherence or connection between its parts, it seems a monster, and can hardly fail to terminate its perplexed movements in some great national calamity. It is a worse preservative of a general constitution than the systasis of Crete, or the confederation of Poland, or any other ill-devised corrective which has yet been imagined in the necessities produced by an ill-constructed system of government.
Having concluded my few remarks on the constitution of the supreme power, the executive, the judicature, the military, and on the reciprocal relation of all these establishments, I shall say something of the ability shown by your legislators with regard to the revenue.
IN THEIR PROCEEDINGS relative to this object, if possible, still fewer traces appear of political judgment or financial resource. When the states met, it seemed to be the great object to improve the system of revenue, to enlarge its collection, to cleanse it of oppression and vexation, and to establish it on the most solid footing. Great were the expectations entertained on that head throughout Europe. It was by this grand arrangement that France was to stand or fall; and this became, in my opinion, very properly the test by which the skill and patriotism of those who ruled in that Assembly would be tried. The revenue of the state is the state. In effect, all depends upon it, whether for support or for reformation. The dignity of every occupation wholly depends upon the quantity and the kind of virtue that may be exerted in it. As all great qualities of the mind which operate in public, and are not merely suffering and passive, require force for their display, I had almost said for their unequivocal existence, the revenue, which is the spring of all power, becomes in its administration the sphere of every active virtue. Public virtue, being of a nature magnificent and splendid, instituted for great things and conversant about great concerns, requires abundant scope and room and cannot spread and grow under confinement and in circumstances straitened, narrow, and sordid. Through the revenue alone the body politic can act in its true genius and character, and, therefore, it will display just as much of its collective virtue, and as much of that virtue which may characterize those who move it and are, as it were, its life and guiding principle, as it is possessed of a just revenue. For from hence not only magnanimity, and liberality, and beneficence, and fortitude, and providence, and the tutelary protection of all good arts derive their food and the growth of their organs; but continence, and self-denial, and labor, and vigilance, and frugality, and whatever else there is in which the mind shows itself above the appetite, are nowhere more in their proper element than in the provision and distribution of the public wealth. It is, therefore, not without reason that the science of speculative and practical finance, which must take to its aid so many auxiliary branches of knowledge, stands high in the estimation not only of the ordinary sort but of the wisest and best men; and as this science has grown with the progress of its object, the prosperity and improvement of nations has generally increased with the increase of their revenues; and they will both continue to grow and flourish as long as the balance between what is left to strengthen the efforts of individuals and what is collected for the common efforts of the state bear to each other a due reciprocal proportion and are kept in a close correspondence and communication. And perhaps it may be owing to the greatness of revenues and to the urgency of state necessities that old abuses in the constitution of finances are discovered and their true nature and rational theory comes to be more perfectly understood: insomuch, that a smaller revenue might have been more distressing in one period than a far greater is found to be in another, the proportionate wealth even remaining the same. In this state of things, the French Assembly found something in their revenues to preserve, to secure, and wisely to administer, as well as to abrogate and alter. Though their proud assumption might justify the severest tests, yet in trying their abilities on their financial proceedings, I would only consider what is the plain obvious duty of a common finance minister, and try them upon that, and not upon models of ideal perfection.
The objects of a financier are, then, to secure an ample revenue, to impose it with judgment and equality, to employ it economically, and when necessity obliges him to make use of credit, to secure its foundations in that instance, and forever, by the clearness and candor of his proceedings, the exactness of his calculations and the solidity of his funds. On these heads we may take a short and distinct view of the merits and abilities of those in the National Assembly who have taken to themselves the management of this arduous concern. Far from any increase of revenue in their hands, I find, by a report of M. Vernier, from the committee of finances, of the second of August last, that the amount of the national revenue, as compared with its produce before the Revolution, was diminished by the sum of two hundred millions, or eight millions sterling of the annual income, considerably more than one-third of the whole.
If this be the result of great ability, never surely was ability displayed in a more distinguished manner or with so powerful an effect. No common folly, no vulgar incapacity, no ordinary official negligence, even no official crime, no corruption, no peculation, hardly any direct hostility which we have seen in the modern world could in so short a time have made so complete an overthrow of the finances and, with them, of the strength of a great kingdom. — Cedo qui vestram rempublicam tantam amisistis tam cito?
The sophisters and declaimers, as soon as the Assembly met, began with decrying the ancient constitution of the revenue in many of its most essential branches, such as the public monopoly of salt. They charged it, as truly as unwisely, with being ill-contrived, oppressive, and partial. This representation they were not satisfied to make use of in speeches preliminary to some plan of reform; they declared it in a solemn resolution or public sentence, as it were judicially passed upon it; and this they dispersed throughout the nation. At the time they passed the decree, with the same gravity they ordered the same absurd, oppressive, and partial tax to be paid until they could find a revenue to replace it. The consequence was inevitable. The provinces which had been always exempted from this salt monopoly, some of whom were charged with other contributions, perhaps equivalent, were totally disinclined to bear any part of the burden which by an equal distribution was to redeem the others. As to the Assembly, occupied as it was with the declaration and violation of the rights of men, and with their arrangements for general confusion, it had neither leisure nor capacity to contrive, nor authority to enforce, any plan of any kind relative to the replacing the tax or equalizing it, or compensating the provinces, or for conducting their minds to any scheme of accommodation with other districts which were to be relieved.
The people of the salt provinces, impatient under taxes, damned by the authority which had directed their payment, very soon found their patience exhausted. They thought themselves as skillful in demolishing as the Assembly could be. They relieved themselves by throwing off the whole burden. Animated by this example, each district, or part of a district, judging of its own grievance by its own feeling, and of its remedy by its own opinion, did as it pleased with other taxes.
We are next to see how they have conducted themselves in contriving equal impositions, proportioned to the means of the citizens, and the least likely to lean heavy on the active capital employed in the generation of that private wealth from whence the public fortune must be derived. By suffering the several districts, and several of the individuals in each district, to judge of what part of the old revenue they might withhold, instead of better principles of equality, a new inequality was introduced of the most oppressive kind. Payments were regulated by dispositions. The parts of the kingdom which were the most submissive, the most orderly, or the most affectionate to the commonwealth bore the whole burden of the state. Nothing turns out to be so oppressive and unjust as a feeble government. To fill up all the deficiencies in the old impositions and the new deficiencies of every kind which were to be expected — what remained to a state without authority? The National Assembly called for a voluntary benevolence: for a fourth part of the income of all the citizens, to be estimated on the honor of those who were to pay. They obtained something more than could be rationally calculated, but what was far indeed from answerable to their real necessities, and much less to their fond expectations. Rational people could have hoped for little from this their tax in the disguise of a benevolence — a tax weak, ineffective, and unequal; a tax by which luxury, avarice, and selfishness were screened, and the load thrown upon productive capital, upon integrity, generosity, and public spirit; a tax of regulation upon virtue. At length the mask is thrown off, and they are now trying means (with little success) of exacting their benevolence by force.
This benevolence, the rickety offspring of weakness, was to be supported by another resource, the twin brother of the same prolific imbecility. The patriotic donations were to make good the failure of the patriotic contribution. John Doe was to become security for Richard Roe. By this scheme they took things of much price from the giver, comparatively of small value to the receiver; they ruined several trades; they pillaged the crown of its ornaments, the churches of their plate, and the people of their personal decorations. The invention of these juvenile pretenders to liberty was in reality nothing more than a servile imitation of one of the poorest resources of doting despotism. They took an old, huge, full-bottomed periwig out of the wardrobe of the antiquated frippery of Louis the Fourteenth to cover the premature baldness of the National Assembly. They produced this old-fashioned formal folly, though it had been so abundantly exposed in the Memoirs of the Duke de St. Simon, if to reasonable men it had wanted any arguments to display its mischief and insufficiency. A device of the same kind was tried, in my memory, by Louis the Fifteenth, but it answered at no time. However, the necessities of ruinous wars were some excuse for desperate projects. The deliberations of calamity are rarely wise. But here was a season for disposition and providence. It was in a time of profound peace, then enjoyed for five years, and promising a much longer continuance, that they had recourse to this desperate trifling. They were sure to lose more reputation by sporting, in their serious situation, with these toys and playthings of finance, which have filled half their journals, than could possibly be compensated by the poor temporary supply which they afforded. It seemed as if those who adopted such projects were wholly ignorant of their circumstances or wholly unequal to their necessities. Whatever virtue may be in these devices, it is obvious that neither the patriotic gifts, nor the patriotic contribution, can ever be resorted to again. The resources of public folly are soon exhausted. The whole, indeed, of their scheme of revenue is to make, by any artifice, an appearance of a full reservoir for the hour, whilst at the same time they cut off the springs and living fountains of perennial supply. The account not long since furnished by M. Necker was meant, without question, to be favorable. He gives a flattering view of the means of getting through the year, but he expresses, as it is natural he should, some apprehension for that which was to succeed. On this last prognostic, instead of entering into the grounds of this apprehension in order, by a proper foresight, to prevent the prognosticated evil, M. Necker receives a sort of friendly reprimand from the president of the Assembly.
As to their other schemes of taxation, it is impossible to say anything of them with certainty, because they have not yet had their operation; but nobody is so sanguine as to imagine they will fill up any perceptible part of the wide gaping breach which their incapacity had made in their revenues. At present the state of their treasury sinks every day more and more in cash, and swells more and more in fictitious representation. When so little within or without is now found but paper, the representative not of opulence but of want, the creature not of credit but of power, they imagine that our flourishing state in England is owing to that bank-paper, and not the bank-paper to the flourishing condition of our commerce, to the solidity of our credit, and to the total exclusion of all idea of power from any part of the transaction. They forget that, in England, not one shilling of paper money of any description is received but of choice; that the whole has had its origin in cash actually deposited; and that it is convertible at pleasure, in an instant and without the smallest loss, into cash again. Our paper is of value in commerce, because in law it is of none. It is powerful on 'Change, because in Westminster Hall it is impotent. In payment of a debt of twenty shillings, a creditor may refuse all the paper of the Bank of England. Nor is there amongst us a single public security, of any quality or nature whatsoever, that is enforced by authority. In fact, it might be easily shown that our paper wealth, instead of lessening the real coin, has a tendency to increase it; instead of being a substitute for money, it only facilitates its entry, its exit, and its circulation; that it is the symbol of prosperity, and not the badge of distress. Never was a scarcity of cash and an exuberance of paper a subject of complaint in this nation.
Well! but a lessening of prodigal expenses, and the economy which has been introduced by the virtuous and sapient Assembly, make amends for the losses sustained in the receipt of revenue. In this at least they have fulfilled the duty of a financier. Have those who say so looked at the expenses of the National Assembly itself, of the municipalities, of the city of Paris, of the increased pay of the two armies, of the new police, of the new judicatures? Have they even carefully compared the present pension list with the former? These politicians have been cruel, not economical. Comparing the expense of the former prodigal government and its relation to the then revenues with the expenses of this new system as opposed to the state of its new treasury, I believe the present will be found beyond all comparison more chargeable. 
It remains only to consider the proofs of financial ability furnished by the present French managers when they are to raise supplies on credit. Here I am a little at a stand, for credit, properly speaking, they have none. The credit of the ancient government was not indeed the best, but they could always, on some terms, command money, not only at home, but from most of the countries of Europe where a surplus capital was accumulated; and the credit of that government was improving daily. The establishment of a system of liberty would of course be supposed to give it new strength; and so it would actually have done if a system of liberty had been established. What offers has their government of pretended liberty had from Holland, from Hamburg, from Switzerland, from Genoa, from England for a dealing in their paper? Why should these nations of commerce and economy enter into any pecuniary dealings with a people who attempt to reverse the very nature of things, amongst whom they see the debtor prescribing at the point of the bayonet the medium of his solvency to the creditor, discharging one of his engagements with another, turning his very penury into his resource and paying his interest with his rags?
Their fanatical confidence in the omnipotence of church plunder has induced these philosophers to overlook all care of the public estate, just as the dream of the philosopher's stone induces dupes, under the more plausible delusion of the hermetic art, to neglect all rational means of improving their fortunes. With these philosophic financiers, this universal medicine made of church mummy is to cure all the evils of the state. These gentlemen perhaps do not believe a great deal in the miracles of piety, but it cannot be questioned that they have an undoubting faith in the prodigies of sacrilege. Is there a debt which presses them? — Issue assignats. Are compensations to be made or a maintenance decreed to those whom they have robbed of their freehold in their office, or expelled from their profession? — Assignats. Is a fleet to be fitted out? — Assignats. If sixteen millions sterling of these assignats, forced on the people, leave the wants of the state as urgent as ever — issue, says one, thirty millions sterling of assignats — says another, issue fourscore millions more of assignats. The only difference among their financial factions is on the greater or the lesser quantity of assignats to be imposed on the public sufferance. They are all professors of assignats. Even those whose natural good sense and knowledge of commerce, not obliterated by philosophy, furnish decisive arguments against this delusion conclude their arguments by proposing the emission of assignats. I suppose they must talk of assignats, as no other language would be understood. All experience of their inefficiency does not in the least discourage them. Are the old assignats depreciated at market? — What is the remedy? Issue new assignats. — Mais si maladia, opiniatria, non vult se garire, quid illi facere? assignare — postea assignare; ensuita assignare. The word is a trifle altered. The Latin of your present doctors may be better than that of your old comedy; their wisdom and the variety of their resources are the same. They have not more notes in their song than the cuckoo, though, far from the softness of that harbinger of summer and plenty, their voice is as harsh and as ominous as that of the raven.
Who but the most desperate adventurers in philosophy and finance could at all have thought of destroying the settled revenue of the state, the sole security for the public credit, in the hope of rebuilding it with the materials of confiscated property? If, however, an excessive zeal for the state should have led a pious and venerable prelate (by anticipation a father of the church to pillage his own order and, for the good of the church and people, to take upon himself the place of grand financier of confiscation and comptroller-general of sacrilege, he and his coadjutors were in my opinion bound to show by their subsequent conduct that they knew something of the office they assumed. When they had resolved to appropriate to the Fisc a certain portion of the landed property of their conquered country, it was their business to render their bank a real fund of credit, as far as such a bank was capable of becoming so.
To establish a current circulating credit upon any Land-bank, under any circumstances whatsoever, has hitherto proved difficult at the very least. The attempt has commonly ended in bankruptcy. But when the Assembly were led, through a contempt of moral, to a defiance of economical principles, it might at least have been expected that nothing would be omitted on their part to lessen this difficulty, to prevent any aggravation of this bankruptcy. It might be expected that to render your land-bank tolerable, every means would be adopted that could display openness and candor in the statement of the security — everything which could aid the recovery of the demand. To take things in their most favorable point of view, your condition was that of a man of a large landed estate which he wished to dispose of for the discharge of a debt and the supply of certain services. Not being able instantly to sell, you wished to mortgage. What would a man of fair intentions and a commonly clear understanding do in such circumstances? Ought he not first to ascertain the gross value of the estate, the charges of its management and disposition, the encumbrances perpetual and temporary of all kinds that affect it, then, striking a net surplus, to calculate the just value of the security? When that surplus (the only security to the creditor) had been clearly ascertained and properly vested in the hands of trustees, then he would indicate the parcels to be sold, and the time and conditions of sale; after this, he would admit the public creditor, if he chose it, to subscribe his stock into this new fund, or he might receive proposals for an assignat from those who would advance money to purchase this species of security.
This would be to proceed like men of business, methodically and rationally, and on the only principles of public and private credit that have an existence. The dealer would then know exactly what he purchased; and the only doubt which could hang upon his mind would be the dread of the resumption of the spoil, which one day might be made (perhaps with an addition of punishment) from the sacrilegious gripe of those execrable wretches who could become purchasers at the auction of their innocent fellow citizens.
AN open and exact statement of the clear value of the property and of the time, the circumstances, and the place of sale were all necessary to efface as much as possible the stigma that has hitherto been branded on every kind of land-bank. It became necessary on another principle, that is, on account of a pledge of faith previously given on that subject, that their future fidelity in a slippery concern might be established by their adherence to their first engagement. When they had finally determined on a state resource from church booty, they came, on the 14th of April, 1790, to a solemn resolution on the subject, and pledged themselves to their country, ""that in the statement of the public charges for each year, there should be brought to account a sum sufficient for defraying the expenses of the R. C. A. religion, the support of the ministers at the altars, the relief of the poor, the pensions to the ecclesiastics, secular as well as regular, of the one and of the other sex, in order that the estates and goods which are at the disposal of the nation may be disengaged of all charges and employed by the representatives, or the legislative body, to the great and most pressing exigencies of the state."" They further engaged, on the same day, that the sum necessary for the year 1791 should be forthwith determined.
In this resolution they admit it their duty to show distinctly the expense of the above objects which, by other resolutions, they had before engaged should be first in the order of provision. They admit that they ought to show the estate clear and disengaged of all charges, and that they should show it immediately. Have they done this immediately, or at any time? Have they ever furnished a rent-roll of the immovable estates, or given in an inventory of the movable effects which they confiscate to their assignats? In what manner they can fulfill their engagements of holding out to public service ""an estate disengaged of all charges"" without authenticating the value of the estate or the quantum of the charges, I leave it to their English admirers to explain. Instantly upon this assurance, and previously to any one step toward making it good, they issue, on the credit of so handsome a declaration, sixteen millions sterling of their paper. This was manly. Who, after this masterly stroke, can doubt of their abilities in finance? But then, before any other emission of these financial indulgences, they took care at least to make good their original promise! — If such estimate either of the value of the estate or the amount of the encumbrances has been made, it has escaped me. I never heard of it.
At length they have spoken out, and they have made a full discovery of their abominable fraud in holding out the church lands as a security for any debts, or any service whatsoever. They rob only to enable them to cheat, but in a very short time they defeat the ends both of the robbery and the fraud by making out accounts for other purposes which blow up their whole apparatus of force and of deception. I am obliged to M. de Calonne for his reference to the document which proves this extraordinary fact; it had by some means escaped me. Indeed it was not necessary to make out my assertion as to the breach of faith on the declaration of the 14th of April, 1790. By a report of their committee it now appears that the charge of keeping up the reduced ecclesiastical establishments and other expenses attendant on religion, and maintaining the religious of both sexes, retained or pensioned, and the other concomitant expenses of the same nature which they have brought upon themselves by this convulsion in property, exceeds the income of the estates acquired by it in the enormous sum of two millions sterling annually, besides a debt of seven millions and upwards. These are the calculating powers of imposture! This is the finance of philosophy! This is the result of all the delusions held out to engage a miserable people in rebellion, murder, and sacrilege, and to make them prompt and zealous instruments in the ruin of their country! Never did a state, in any case, enrich itself by the confiscations of the citizens. This new experiment has succeeded like all the rest. Every honest mind, every true lover of liberty and humanity, must rejoice to find that injustice is not always good policy, nor rapine the high road to riches. I subjoin with pleasure, in a note, the able and spirited observations of M. de Calonne on this subject.
In order to persuade the world of the bottomless resource of ecclesiastical confiscation, the Assembly have proceeded to other confiscations of estates in offices, which could not be done with any common color without being compensated out of this grand confiscation of landed property. They have thrown upon this fund, which was to show a surplus disengaged of all charges, a new charge — namely, the compensation to the whole body of the disbanded judicature, and of all suppressed offices and estates, a charge which I cannot ascertain, but which unquestionably amounts to many French millions. Another of the new charges is an annuity of four hundred and eighty thousand pounds sterling, to be paid (if they choose to keep faith) by daily payments, for the interest of the first assignats. Have they even given themselves the trouble to state fairly the expense of the management of the church lands in the hands of the municipalities to whose care, skill, and diligence, and that of their legion of unknown underagents, they have chosen to commit the charge of the forfeited estates, the consequence of which had been so ably pointed out by the bishop of Nancy?
But it is unnecessary to dwell on these obvious heads of encumbrance. Have they made out any clear state of the grand encumbrance of all, I mean the whole of the general and municipal establishments of all sorts, and compared it with the regular income by revenue? Every deficiency in these becomes a charge on the confiscated estate before the creditor can plant his cabbages on an acre of church property. There is no other prop than this confiscation to keep the whole state from tumbling to the ground. In this situation they have purposely covered all that they ought industriously to have cleared with a thick fog, and then, blindfold themselves, like bulls that shut their eyes when they push, they drive, by the point of the bayonets, their slaves, blindfolded indeed no worse than their lords, to take their fictions for currencies and to swallow down paper pills by thirty-four millions sterling at a dose. Then they proudly lay in their claim to a future credit, on failure of all their past engagements, and at a time when (if in such a matter anything can be clear) it is clear that the surplus estates will never answer even the first of their mortgages, I mean that of the four hundred millions (or sixteen millions sterling) of assignats. In all this procedure I can discern neither the solid sense of plain dealing nor the subtle dexterity of ingenious fraud. The objections within the Assembly to pulling up the floodgates for this inundation of fraud are unanswered, but they are thoroughly refuted by a hundred thousand financiers in the street. These are the numbers by which the metaphysic arithmeticians compute. These are the grand calculations on which a philosophical public credit is founded in France. They cannot raise supplies, but they can raise mobs. Let them rejoice in the applauses of the club at Dundee for their wisdom and patriotism in having thus applied the plunder of the citizens to the service of the state. I hear of no address upon this subject from the directors of the Bank of England, though their approbation would be of a little more weight in the scale of credit than that of the club at Dundee. But, to do justice to the club, I believe the gentlemen who compose it to be wiser than they appear; that they will be less liberal of their money than of their addresses; and that they would not give a dog's ear of their most rumpled and ragged Scotch paper for twenty of your fairest assignats.
Early in this year the Assembly issued paper to the amount of sixteen millions sterling; what must have been the state into which the Assembly has brought your affairs, that the relief afforded by so vast a supply has been hardly perceptible? This paper also felt an almost immediate depreciation of five per cent, which in a little time came to about seven. The effect of these assignats on the receipt of the revenue is remarkable. M. Necker found that the collectors of the revenue who received in coin paid the treasury in assignats. The collectors made seven per cent by thus receiving in money and accounting in depreciated paper. It was not very difficult to foresee that this must be inevitable. It was, however, not the less embarrassing. M. Necker was obliged (I believe, for a considerable part, in the market of London) to buy gold and silver for the mint, which amounted to about twelve thousand pounds above the value of the commodity gained. That minister was of opinion that, whatever their secret nutritive virtue might be, the state could not live upon assignats alone, that some real silver was necessary, particularly for the satisfaction of those who, having iron in their hands, were not likely to distinguish themselves for patience when they should perceive that, whilst an increase of pay was held out to them in real money, it was again to be fraudulently drawn back by depreciated paper. The minister, in this very natural distress, applied to the Assembly that they should order the collectors to pay in specie what in specie they had received. It could not escape him that if the treasury paid three per cent for the use of a currency which should be returned seven per cent worse than the minister issued it, such a dealing could not very greatly tend to enrich the public. The Assembly took no notice of this recommendation. They were in this dilemma: if they continued to receive the assignats, cash must become an alien to their treasury; if the treasury should refuse those paper amulets or should discountenance them in any degree, they must destroy the credit of their sole resource. They seem then to have made their option, and to have given some sort of credit to their paper by taking it themselves; at the same time in their speeches they made a sort of swaggering declaration, something, I rather think, above legislative competence; that is, that there is no difference in value between metallic money and their assignats. This was a good, stout, proof article of faith, pronounced under an anathema by the venerable fathers of this philosophic synod. Credat who will — certainly not Judaeus Apella.
A noble indignation rises in the minds of your popular leaders on hearing the magic lantern in their show of finance compared to the fraudulent exhibitions of Mr. Law. They cannot bear to hear the sands of his Mississippi compared with the rock of the church on which they build their system. Pray let them suppress this glorious spirit until they show to the world what piece of solid ground there is for their assignats which they have not preoccupied by other charges. They do injustice to that great mother fraud to compare it with their degenerate imitation. It is not true that Law built solely on a speculation concerning the Mississippi. He added the East India trade; he added the African trade; he added the farms of all the farmed revenue of France. All these together unquestionably could not support the structure which the public enthusiasm, not he, chose to build upon these bases. But these were, however, in comparison generous delusions. They supposed, and they aimed at, an increase of the commerce of France. They opened to it the whole range of the two hemispheres. They did not think of feeding France from its own substance. A grand imagination found in this night of commerce something to captivate. It was wherewithal to dazzle the eye of an eagle. It was not made to entice the smell of a mole nuzzling and burying himself in his mother earth, as yours is. Men were not then quite shrunk from their natural dimensions by a degrading and sordid philosophy, and fitted for low and vulgar deceptions. Above all, remember that in imposing on the imagination the then managers of the system made a compliment to the freedom of men. In their fraud there was no mixture of force. This was reserved to our time, to quench the little glimmerings of reason which might break in upon the solid darkness of this enlightened age.
On recollection, I have said nothing of a scheme of finance which may be urged in favor of the abilities of these gentlemen, and which has been introduced with great pomp, though not yet finally adopted, in the National Assembly. It comes with something solid in aid of the credit of the paper circulation; and much has been said of its utility and its elegance. I mean the project for coining into money the bells of the suppressed churches. This is their alchemy. There are some follies which baffle argument, which go beyond ridicule, and which excite no feeling in us but disgust; and therefore I say no more upon it.
It is as little worth remarking any further upon all their drawing and re-drawing on their circulation for putting off the evil day, on the play between the treasury and the Caisse d'Escompte, and on all these old, exploded contrivances of mercantile fraud now exalted into policy of state. The revenue will not be trifled with. The prattling about the rights of men will not be accepted in payment for a biscuit or a pound of gunpowder. Here then the metaphysicians descend from their airy speculations and faithfully follow examples. What examples? The examples of bankrupts. But defeated, baffled, disgraced, when their breath, their strength, their inventions, their fancies desert them, their confidence still maintains its ground. In the manifest failure of their abilities, they take credit for their benevolence. When the revenue disappears in their hands, they have the presumption, in some of their late proceedings, to value themselves on the relief given to the people. They did not relieve the people. If they entertained such intentions, why did they order the obnoxious taxes to be paid? The people relieved themselves in spite of the Assembly.
But waiving all discussion on the parties who may claim the merit of this fallacious relief, has there been, in effect, any relief to the people in any form? Mr. Bailly, one of the grand agents of paper circulation, lets you into the nature of this relief. His speech to the National Assembly contained a high and labored panegyric on the inhabitants of Paris for the constancy and unbroken resolution with which they have borne their distress and misery. A fine picture of public felicity! What great courage and unconquerable firmness of mind to endure benefits and sustain redress! One would think from the speech of this learned lord mayor that the Parisians, for this twelvemonth past, had been suffering the straits of some dreadful blockade, that Henry the Fourth had been stopping up the avenues to their supply, and Sully thundering with his ordnance at the gates of Paris, when in reality they are besieged by no other enemies than their own madness and folly, their own credulity and perverseness. But Mr. Bailly will sooner thaw the eternal ice of his Atlantic regions than restore the central heat to Paris whilst it remains ""smitten with the cold, dry, petrific mace"" of a false and unfeeling philosophy. Some time after this speech, that is, on the thirteenth of last August, the same magistrate, giving an account of his government at the bar of the same Assembly, expresses himself as follows:
    In the month of July, 1789, (the period of everlasting commemoration) the
    finances of the city of Paris were yet in good order; the expenditure was
    counterbalanced by the receipt; and she had at that time a million (forty
    thousand pounds sterling) in bank.
    The expenses which she has been constrained to incur, subsequent to the
    Revolution, amount to 2,500,000 livres. From these expenses, and the great
    falling off in the product of the free gifts, not only a momentary, but a
    total, want of money has taken place.
This is the Paris upon whose nourishment, in the course of the last year, such immense sums, drawn from the vitals of all France, have been expended. As long as Paris stands in the place of ancient Rome, so long she will be maintained by the subject provinces. It is an evil inevitably attendant on the dominion of sovereign democratic republics. As it happened in Rome, it may survive that republican domination which gave rise to it. In that case despotism itself must submit to the vices of popularity.
Rome, under her emperors, united the evils of both systems; and this unnatural combination was one great cause of her ruin.
To tell the people that they are relieved by the dilapidation of their public estate is a cruel and insolent imposition. Statesmen, before they valued themselves on the relief given to the people by the destruction of their revenue, ought first to have carefully attended to the solution of this problem — whether it be more advantageous to the people to pay considerably and to gain in proportion, or to gain little or nothing and to be disburdened of all contribution? My mind is made up to decide in favor of the first proposition. Experience is with me, and, I believe, the best opinions also. To keep a balance between the power of acquisition on the part of the subject and the demands he is to answer on the part of the state is the fundamental part of the skill of a true politician. The means of acquisition are prior in time and in arrangement. Good order is the foundation of all good things. To be enabled to acquire, the people, without being servile, must be tractable and obedient. The magistrate must have his reverence, the laws their authority. The body of the people must not find the principles of natural subordination by art rooted out of their minds. They must respect that property of which they cannot partake. They must labor to obtain what by labor can be obtained; and when they find, as they commonly do, the success disproportioned to the endeavour, they must be taught their consolation in the final proportions of eternal justice. Of this consolation, whoever deprives them deadens their industry and strikes at the root of all acquisition as of all conservation. He that does this is the cruel oppressor, the merciless enemy of the poor and wretched, at the same time that by his wicked speculations he exposes the fruits of successful industry and the accumulations of fortune to the plunder of the negligent, the disappointed, and the unprosperous.
Too many of the financiers by profession are apt to see nothing in revenue but banks, and circulations, and annuities on lives, and tontines, and perpetual rents, and all the small wares of the shop. In a settled order of the state, these things are not to be slighted, nor is the skill in them to be held of trivial estimation. They are good, but then only good when they assume the effects of that settled order and are built upon it. But when men think that these beggarly contrivances may supply a resource for the evils which result from breaking up the foundations of public order, and from causing or suffering the principles of property to be subverted, they will, in the ruin of their country, leave a melancholy and lasting monument of the effect of preposterous politics and presumptuous, short-sighted, narrow-minded wisdom.
The effects of the incapacity shown by the popular leaders in all the great members of the commonwealth are to be covered with the ""all-atoning name"" of liberty. In some people I see great liberty indeed; in many, if not in the most, an oppressive, degrading servitude. But what is liberty without wisdom and without virtue? It is the greatest of all possible evils; for it is folly, vice, and madness, without tuition or restraint. Those who know what virtuous liberty is cannot bear to see it disgraced by incapable heads on account of their having high-sounding words in their mouths. Grand, swelling sentiments of liberty I am sure I do not despise. They warm the heart; they enlarge and liberalize our minds; they animate our courage in a time of conflict. Old as I am, I read the fine raptures of Lucan and Corneille with pleasure. Neither do I wholly condemn the little arts and devices of popularity. They facilitate the carrying of many points of moment; they keep the people together; they refresh the mind in its exertions; and they diffuse occasional gaiety over the severe brow of moral freedom. Every politician ought to sacrifice to the graces, and to join compliance with reason. But in such an undertaking as that in France, all these subsidiary sentiments and artifices are of little avail. To make a government requires no great prudence. Settle the seat of power, teach obedience, and the work is done. To give freedom is still more easy. It is not necessary to guide; it only requires to let go the rein. But to form a free government, that is, to temper together these opposite elements of liberty and restraint in one consistent work, requires much thought, deep reflection, a sagacious, powerful, and combining mind. This I do not find in those who take the lead in the National Assembly. Perhaps they are not so miserably deficient as they appear. I rather believe it. It would put them below the common level of human understanding. But when the leaders choose to make themselves bidders at an auction of popularity, their talents, in the construction of the state, will be of no service. They will become flatterers instead of legislators, the instruments, not the guides, of the people. If any of them should happen to propose a scheme of liberty, soberly limited and defined with proper qualifications, he will be immediately outbid by his competitors who will produce something more splendidly popular. Suspicions will be raised of his fidelity to his cause. Moderation will be stigmatized as the virtue of cowards, and compromise as the prudence of traitors, until, in hopes of preserving the credit which may enable him to temper and moderate, on some occasions, the popular leader is obliged to become active in propagating doctrines and establishing powers that will afterwards defeat any sober purpose at which he ultimately might have aimed.
But am I so unreasonable as to see nothing at all that deserves commendation in the indefatigable labors of this Assembly? I do not deny that, among an infinite number of acts of violence and folly, some good may have been done. They who destroy everything certainly will remove some grievance. They who make everything new have a chance that they may establish something beneficial. To give them credit for what they have done in virtue of the authority they have usurped, or which can excuse them in the crimes by which that authority has been acquired, it must appear that the same things could not have been accomplished without producing such a revolution. Most assuredly they might, because almost every one of the regulations made by them which is not very equivocal was either in the cession of the king, voluntarily made at the meeting of the states, or in the concurrent instructions to the orders. Some usages have been abolished on just grounds, but they were such that if they had stood as they were to all eternity, they would little detract from the happiness and prosperity of any state. The improvements of the National Assembly are superficial, their errors fundamental.
Whatever they are, I wish my countrymen rather to recommend to our neighbors the example of the British constitution than to take models from them for the improvement of our own. In the former, they have got an invaluable treasure. They are not, I think, without some causes of apprehension and complaint, but these they do not owe to their constitution but to their own conduct. I think our happy situation owing to our constitution, but owing to the whole of it, and not to any part singly, owing in a great measure to what we have left standing in our several reviews and reformations as well as to what we have altered or superadded. Our people will find employment enough for a truly patriotic, free, and independent spirit in guarding what they possess from violation. I would not exclude alteration neither, but even when I changed, it should be to preserve. I should be led to my remedy by a great grievance. In what I did, I should follow the example of our ancestors. I would make the reparation as nearly as possible in the style of the building. A politic caution, a guarded circumspection, a moral rather than a complexional timidity were among the ruling principles of our forefathers in their most decided conduct. Not being illuminated with the light of which the gentlemen of France tell us they have got so abundant a share, they acted under a strong impression of the ignorance and fallibility of mankind. He that had made them thus fallible rewarded them for having in their conduct attended to their nature. Let us imitate their caution if we wish to deserve their fortune or to retain their bequests. Let us add, if we please, but let us preserve what they have left; and, standing on the firm ground of the British constitution, let us be satisfied to admire rather than attempt to follow in their desperate flights the aeronauts of France.
I have told you candidly my sentiments. I think they are not likely to alter yours. I do not know that they ought. You are young; you cannot guide but must follow the fortune of your country. But hereafter they may be of some use to you, in some future form which your commonwealth may take. In the present it can hardly remain; but before its final settlement it may be obliged to pass, as one of our poets says, ""through great varieties of untried being"", and in all its transmigrations to be purified by fire and blood.
I have little to recommend my opinions but long observation and much impartiality. They come from one who has been no tool of power, no flatterer of greatness; and who in his last acts does not wish to belie the tenor of his life. They come from one almost the whole of whose public exertion has been a struggle for the liberty of others; from one in whose breast no anger, durable or vehement, has ever been kindled but by what he considered as tyranny; and who snatches from his share in the endeavors which are used by good men to discredit opulent oppression the hours he has employed on your affairs; and who in so doing persuades himself he has not departed from his usual office; they come from one who desires honors, distinctions, and emoluments but little, and who expects them not at all; who has no contempt for fame, and no fear of obloquy; who shuns contention, though he will hazard an opinion; from one who wishes to preserve consistency, but who would preserve consistency by varying his means to secure the unity of his end, and, when the equipoise of the vessel in which he sails may be endangered by overloading it upon one side, is desirous of carrying the small weight of his reasons to that which may preserve its equipoise.

. It is proper here to refer to a letter written upon this subject by an eye witness. That eye witness was one of the most honest, intelligent, and eloquent members of the National Assembly, one of the most active and zealous reformers of the state. He was obliged to secede from the Assembly; and he afterwards became a voluntary exile, on account of the horrors of this pious triumph and the dispositions of men who, profiting of crimes, if not causing them, have taken the lead in public affairs.
. N.B. Mr. Mounier was then speaker of the National Assembly. He has since been obliged to live in exile, though one of the firmest assertors of liberty.

. The English are, I conceive, misrepresented in a letter published in one of the papers, by a gentleman thought to be a dissenting minister. — When writing to Dr. Price of the spirit which prevails at Paris, he says: ""The spirit of the people in this place has abolished all the proud distinctions which the king and nobles had usurped in their minds; whether they talk of the king, the noble, or the priest, their whole language is that of the most enlightened and liberal among st the English"". If this gentleman means to confine the terms ""enlightened"" and ""liberal"" to one set of men in England, it may be true. It is not generally so.

. The rest of the passage is this
""Who having spent the treasures of his crown,
Condemns their luxury to feed his own.
And yet this act, to varnish over the shame
Of sacrilege, must bear devotion's name.
No crime so bold, but would be understood
A real, or at least a seeming good;
Who fears not to do ill, yet fears the name,
And, free from conscience, is a slave to fame.
Thus he the church at once protects, and spoils;
But princes swords are sharper than their styles
And thus to the ages past he makes amends,
Their charity destroys, their faith defends.
Then did religion in a lazy cell,
In empty aery contemplation dwell;
And, like the block, unmoved lay; but ours,
As much too active, like the stork devours.
Is there no temperate region can be known,
Betwixt their frigid and our torrid zone?
Could we not wake from that lethargic dream,
But to be restless in a worse extreme?
And for that lethargy was there no cure,
But to be cast into a calenture?
Can knowledge have no bound, but must advance
So far, to make us wish for ignorance?
And rather in the dark to grope our way,
Than, led by a false guide, to err by day?
Who sees these dismal heaps, but would demand,
What barbarous invader sacked the land?
But when he hears, no Goth, no Turk did bring
This desolation, but a Christian king;
When nothing, but the name of zeal, appears
Twixt our best actions and the worst of theirs,
What does he think our sacrilege would spare,
When such the effects of our devotion are?""

. In the constitution of Scotland, during the Stuart reigns, a committee sat for preparing bills; and none could pass but those previously approved by them. The committee was called ""Lords of Articles"".
. When I wrote this I quoted from memory, after many years had elapsed from my reading the passage. A learned friend has found it, and it is as follows:
To ethos to auto, kai ampho despotika ton beltionon, kai ta psephismata, osper ekei ta epitagmata kai o demagogos kai o kolax, oi autoi kai analogoi kai malista ekateroi par ekaterois ischuousin, oi men kolakes para turannois, oi de demagogoi para tois demois tois toioutois.
""The ethical character is the same; both exercise despotism over the better class of citizens; and decrees are in the one, what ordinances and arrets are in the other: the demagogue, too, and the court favorite are not unfrequently the same identical men, and always bear a close analogy; and these have the principal power, each in their respective forms of government, favorites with the absolute monarch, and demagogues with a people such as I have described"".

. Whether the following description is strictly true, I know not; but it is what the publishers would have pass for true in order to animate others. In a letter from Toul, given in one of their papers, is the following passage concerning the people of that district: ""Dans la Revolution actuelle, ils ont resiste a toutes les seductions du bigotisme, aux persecutions, et aux tracasseries des ennemis de la Revolution. Oubliant leurs plus grands interets pour rendre hommage aux vues d'ordre general qui ont determine l'Assemblee Nationale, ils voient, sans se plaindre, supprimer cette foule detablissemens ecclesiastiques par lesquels ils subsistoient; et meme, en perdant leur siege episcopal, la seule de toutes ces ressources qui pouvoit, ou plutot qui devoit, en toute equite, leur etre conservee; condamnes a la plus effrayante misere, sans avoir ete ni pu etre entendus, ils ne murmurent point, ils restent fideles aux principes du plus pur patriotisme; ils sont encore prets a verser leur sang pour le maintien de la Constitution, qui va reduire leur ville a la plus deplorable nullite."" These people are not supposed to have endured those sufferings and injustices in a struggle for liberty, for the same account states truly that they had been always free; their patience in beggary and ruin, and their suffering, without remonstrance, the most flagrant and confessed injustice, if strictly true, can be nothing but the effect of this dire fanaticism. A great multitude all over France is in the same condition and the same temper.
. See the proceedings of the confederation at Nantz.
. ""Si plures sunt ii quibus improbe datum est, quam illi quibus injuste ademptum est, idcirco plus etiam valent? Non enim numero haec judicantur sed pondere. Quam autem habet aequitatem, ut agrum multis annis, aut etiam saeculis ante possessum, qui nullum habuit habeat; qui autem habuit amittat? Ac, propter hoc injuriae genus, Lacedaemonii Lysandrum Ephorum expulerunt: Agin regem (quod nunquam antea apud eos acciderat) necaverunt: exque eo tempore tantae discordiae secutae sunt, ut et tyranni existerint, et optimates exterminarentur, et preclarissime constituta respublica dilaberetur. Nec vero solum ipsa cecidit, sed etiam reliquam Graeciam evertit contagionibus malorum, quae a Lacedaemoniis profectae manarunt latius"". — After speaking of the conduct of the model of true patriots, Aratus of Sicyon, which was in a very different spirit, he says, ""Sic par est agere cum civibus; non ut bis jam vidimus, hastam in foro ponere et bona civium voci subjicere praeconis. At ille Graecus (id quod fuit sapientis et praestantis viri) omnibus consulendum esse putavit: eaque est summa ratio et sapientia boni civis, commoda civium non divellere, sed omnes eadem aequitate continere."" Cic. Off. 1. 2.
. See two books entitled, Einige Originalschriften des Illuminatenordens. — System und Folgen des Illuminatenordens. Munchen, 1787.
. A leading member of the Assembly, M. Rabaud de St. Etienne, has expressed the principle of all their proceedings as clearly as possible Nothing can be more simple: ""Tous les etablissemens en France couronnent le malheur du peuple: pour le rendre heureux il faut le renouveler; changer ses idees; changer ses loix; changer ses moeurs;... changer les hommes; changer les choses; changer les mots... tout detruire; oui, tout detruire; puisque tout est a recreer"". This gentleman was chosen president in an assembly not sitting at the Quinze-vingt, or the Petits Maisons; and composed of persons giving themselves out to be rational beings; but neither his ideas, language, or conduct, differ in the smallest degree from the discourses, opinions, and actions of those within and without the Assembly, who direct the operations of the machine now at work in France.
. The Assembly, in executing the plan of their committee, made some alterations. They have struck out one stage in these gradations; this removes a part of the objection; but the main objection, namely, that in their scheme the first constituent voter has no connection with the representative legislator, remains in all its force. There are other alterations, some possibly for the better, some certainly for the worse; but to the author the merit or demerit of these smaller alterations appears to be of no moment where the scheme itself is fundamentally vicious and absurd.
. Non, ut olim, universae legiones deducebantur cum tribunis, et centurionibus, et sui cujusque ordinis militibus, ut consensu et caritate rempublicam afficerent; sed ignoti inter se, diversis manipulis, sine rectore, sine affectibus mutuis, quasi ex alio genere mortalium, repente in unum collecti, numerus magis quam colonia. Tac. Annal. 1. 14, sect. 27. All this will be still more applicable to the unconnected, rotatory, biennial national assemblies, in this absurd and senseless constitution.

Comme sa Majeste y a reconnu, non une systeme d'associations particulieres, mais une reunion de volontes de tous les Francois pour la liberte et la prosperite communes, ainsi pour la maintien de l'ordre publique; il a pense qu'il convenoit que chaque regiment prit part a ces fetes civiques pour multiplier les rapports et reserrer les liens d'union entre les citoyens et les troupes. — Lest should not be credited, I insert the words, authorizing the troops to feast with the popular confederacies.

. Courier Francois, 30th July, 1790. Assemblee Nationale, Numero 210.
. I see by M. Necker's account that the national guards of Paris have received, over and above the money levied within their own city, about £145,000 sterling out of the public treasures. Whether this be an actual payment for the nine months of their existence or an estimate of their yearly charge, I do not clearly perceive. It is of no great importance, as certainly they may take whatever they please.
. The reader will observe that I have but lightly touched (my plan demanded nothing more) on the condition of the French finances, as connected with the demands upon them. If I had intended to do otherwise, the materials in my hands for such a task are not altogether perfect. On this subject I refer the reader to M. de Calonne's work; and the tremendous display that he has made of the havoc and devastation in the public estate, and in all the affairs of France, caused by the presumptuous good intentions of ignorance and incapacity. Such effects those causes will always produce. Looking over that account with a pretty strict eye, and, with perhaps too much rigor, deducting everything which may be placed to the account of a financier out of place, who might be supposed by his enemies desirous of making the most of his cause, I believe it will be found that a more salutary lesson of caution against the daring spirit of innovators than what has been supplied at the expense of France never was at any time furnished to mankind.

Mais le peuple que vous y interessez, quel avantage peut-il y trouver? En vous servant sans cesse de lui, que faites vous pour lui? Rien, absolument rien; &, au contraire, vous faites ce qui ne conduit qu'a l'accabler de nouvelles charges. Vous avez rejete, a son prejudice, une offre de 400 millions, dont l'acceptation pouvoit devenir un moyen de soulagement en sa faveur; & a cette ressource, aussi profitable que legitime, vous avez substitue une injustice ruineuse, qui, de votre propre aveu, charge le tresor public, & par consequent le peuple, d'un surcroit de depense annuelle de 50 millions au moins, & d'un remboursement de 150 millions.
""Malheureux peuple, voila ce que vous vaut en dernier resultat l'expropriation de l'Eglise, & la durete des decrets taxateurs du traitement des ministres d'une religion bienfaisante; & deformais ils seront a votre charge: leurs charites soulageoient les pauvres; vous allez etre imposes pour subvenir a leur entretien!"" — De l'Etat de la France, p. 81.

Sayang, bakit ako nag-alinlangan pa

Ako na 'yong alipin at ayoko ng pilitin
Pa sayo, dapat kong ituloy na ang paglayo
Biktima nitong tadhana natin na mapaglaro
Dahil kung titignan sa titig lang para bang nabibiglang
Naiwan tulala ng dahil lamang sa pagibig lang
Di na mapagbibigyan at yon ang masakit
Sana ay hindi nalang pala sayo napalapit
Sa napiling mahalin ay bakit ba sayo pa nga ba?
At ang Dellong mainipin pagdating sayo mahaba
Ang pasensya at nagti-tiyagang nag aabang kahit ilang
Beses ng pinagmumukhang tanga't hibang nagbibilang
Ng aking pagkakataon, pero bat nagkaganon
Mahal kita, mahal mo sya, nagtataka't nagtatanong
Kung bakit ka naging tanga para lang maloko nya
Ako naman ang mas tanga dahil kahit ayoko na
Nagbabalik parin at ako sayo'y palagi
Pero di ka naman sakin kailanman di maaari
Sakin ikaw ang reyna, di naman ako ang hari
Kung alam ko lang nung una di na sana 'to nangyari
Di na sana naganap, ako na sana'y naghanap
Ng ibang dapat ibigin di na sana ako hirap
Sa kalagayan ko ngayon kung nalaman ko noon
Na maiinlab pala ko kaagad sa isang iglap
Sana di nalang
Di na sana kita nakilala, di na sana ako lumapit
Di na sana kita nakilala, di na sana ako nagdurusa ng
Dahil lang sayo

Sana nung umpisa hindi na tayo nagtabi
Kaya ngayon ay alanganin napaibig mo kasi
At naging kabado na ko kahit di pa nagkape
Umaasta na ayos kahit na hindi naman kami
Sana di ka napayuhan tungkol sa mga Ex
Sana wala akong cellphone para di ka nakatext
Nung in-add kita sa facebook sana di mo in-accept
Ngayon sarili ko bakit ba hindi ko masagip
Sana di na umalalay sayo sa pagtawid
Pagpunta mo sa Cavite, sana di na naghatid
At ang aking nahawakan sana di sayong kamay
Kaya ako'y nahihirapan pagkat di ngayon sanay
Na wala ka sa tabi, parang wala sa katinuan
Sana di na uminom para di ka nakainuman
Sana di na naglasing para di naging praning
Na kahit magpakasabog sitwasyon ganun parin
Na ako'y isang alalay na laging nakasunod
Na kahit ka pa nakalugay o kahit nakapusod
Maganda ka parin sa paningin at palihim nakatingin
Sayo mula umaga, tanghali, hanggang sa gabihin
Mahirap na tong gawin kahit na ipikit
Ang mga mata. bakit ba ang puso ang kulit
Kahit nadama ulit sa damdamin ang pait
Sana di ka minahal dahil ang sakit
 (Repeat 2x)
Di na sana kita nakilala, di na sana ako lumapit
Di na sana kita nakilala, di na sana ako nagdurusa ng
Dahil lang sayo

Alam mo
Di na talaga sana tayo nagkakilala eh..
Di ko alam bakit pa tayo nagkita
Nagkaroon pa ng ikaw saka ako
Ngayon, di ko alam pano lulusutan lahat ng nangyari satin
Bakit may isang ikaw na hindi pwedeng maging sakin
Bakit ang mga gabi ay hindi pwedeng maging satin
Kung pwede lang na ang nadarama 'toy palipatin
Maisalin ko sa iba, ayaw bang marapatin
Ang pag kakataon, bakit pa ngayon pa lumitaw
Kung kailan di na pwede at kailangan ko ng bumitaw
Sa pag-asa ng pagibig na hapdi ang dinala
Kasi mahal kita ng sobra... sana di nalang pala..."

End of another long show
And I search for the love of a lifetime
This is the best that you gave

Need of some laughter

Oh, please let me live in your world

I can have anyone that I see

Dapat ba na ako ay manatili sa sitwasyong na di ako alam

Kahit ano pa sabihin meronng kapalit Kung saan may liwanag laging may lilim
Papasilaw pa ako kung sakali
Ang takbo ng oras pa abante
Kung ano man desisyon ay di mababalik
Kung ano man ang posibleng mangyare
At kung isang gabi lang?
Bakit hindi?
Kung maari halika saking tabi
At kung isang gabi langgg?
Mag kamali?

Laro nalang ba palagi
Parang may iba yatang kasali

Sabihin mo sa akin kung wala na nga
Kasi ang daming nasayang, ilang oras, ilang araw na
Bakit nagkaganyan?
Ganon na ba kadali umayaw?

Bakit, bakit ka umalis?
Wala ka man lang sinabi
Parang iniwan ako sa isang tabi
Bakit, bakit ka umalis?
Laro nalang ba palagi
Parang may iba yatang kasali
Sagutin mo 'ko, bakit
Bakit wala kang masabi
Sagutin mo 'ko, bakit
Bakit wala kang masabi

Bakit
Bakit
Bakit"

Oooh, oooh

Kailan pa ba
Naging larawan ng pag-ibig
Ang pagtikom ng iyong isipan
Na para bang may dambuhalang
Kinakatakutan na manguha
Ooooh, oooh
Oooh, oooh

Nililinang ang panlilinlang
Sa isipang natutunghayang nagtatagisan
Kaliwa't kanang usapan
Ngunit walang nakaaalam
Ikaw at ikaw lang naman

Magkano na ba ang 'yong kaluluwa? Oooh
Ikaw ba'y nasasakal sa pamumuhay ng hangal?
Magkano na ba ang 'yong kaluluwa? Oooh
Manatiling mulat sa hirap ng 'yong paghinga
Ikaw ba'y nasasakal
(Magkano?)
Sa pamumuhay ng hangal?
(Magkano, magkano?)
Manatiling mulat sa
(Magkano?)
Hirap ng 'yong paghinga

57,84201898,Kung Mahal Mo Siya,Jay R,[15],['R&B/Soul'],"Intro
Oh...... Yeah
Di ko kayang mag isa
Dahil kailanman ay laging ikaw
Ang siyang iibigin ko sa tuwina
Di mo man sabihin ang nasa damdamin
Ay nadaramang lumalayo ka na ngayon sa akin
Chorus
Kung mahal mo siya ay pipilitin kong
Di mo makita na di ko kaya
Kung mahal mo siya di mo maririnig sa akin
Ang mga hikbi dahil mahal kita
Kung di mo makita sa kanya ang nais
Ay narito ako naghihintay pa rin lagi ang puso
Di ka pipilitin na muling ibigin tatandaan mo lang
Na ganun pa rin ikaw sa akin
Chorus
Refrain
Ganyan ang pag ibig na alay ko
Hinding hindi magbabago
Magunay at maglaho man itong mundo
Ikaw ang pag ibig ko
Chorus"

62,198121996,Alapaap (feat. Liaah & Jobe Derick),VIN,[15],['R&B/Soul'],"Piti viettää koti-ilta mut se menee puihin
Kun alapäät alkaa kuuloluihin
Idän diskoista jymistä
Se haittaa keskittymistä
Vaik on vieressä vino pino Willereitä
Niin diskos on himokkaita hillereitä
Ja on hallaa koti-illalle
Jos ilmassa tuoksuu villalle
Mut ei, en alistu
Jos koskaan ei lue, ei valistu
Ja tungen korviini kittiä
Diggailen Texiä, Carsonin Kittiä
Nyrkkitappeluita, ruutia, rikkiä
Mut ketä mä petän?
Onko disko valmis, soiko poppi?
Rautis tulee, ota koppi!
Rautis tulee, ota koppi! Ota koppi!
Rautis tulee, ota koppi!
Rautis tulee! Ota koppi!
Onko disko valmis, soiko poppi?
Rautis tulee, ota koppi!
Wenlassa Rotan kunniaks tervetulijaismalja
Mut en olis se aidoin Rautaperse
Jos mielessä ei ois talja
Komeettaan tapittamaan
Että kenet valkkaan napittamaan
Mut ulos ahtaista byysistä
Eteen muodostuu ryysistä
Siin on villaa ku lankakerällä
Hei, ollaan iisisti siellä perällä
Sillä pelin henki tän rehdin
On että puikotan minkä ehdin
Ja jos sun ei tarvii luntata
Miten cupidoja kutkassa humpata
Niin löytyykö soppi ja siisti moppi?
Rautis tulee, ota koppi!
Rautis tulee, ota koppi! Ota koppi!
Rautis tulee, ota koppi!
Rautis tulee! Ota koppi!
Löytyykö soppi ja siisti moppi?
Rautis tulee, ota koppi!"

Puro lang groupies huh bilang ang aking homies
Uso kasi ang set up so no love to fucking phonies
I’m taking my time doing my grind taking it easy baby
Rolling the weed, planting seeds, keeping it high up baby
Walang uumutos ako ang boss dimo katulad baby
Kontrolado ko ang buhay ko di ako alipin baby
Grinding, stress free, walang 9 to 5
Isang weekend ko isang buwan mo ng strive
Puro ka trabaho pero di nagsusurvie

Kahit na alam kong wala akong babalikan

Kahit na pilit kitang iwasan
Alaala mo'y lagi kong tangan
Dapat ba sadyang tanggapin
'Di kita kayang limutin
Kahit na tayo'y nagbago, iisa ang ating mundo

Hahanap-hanapin ka

Bakit ba ang hirap pigilan?
Para bang sinasapian

Paano mo naisip na
Hindi ako nasasaktan?
Hindi porke’t sinasakyan
Ay hindi na ‘ko nasasaktan
Kung alam mo lang
Hindi mo lang nababatid
Kung alam mo lang
Kasi ‘di naman ako manhid
Kasi kung alam mo lang
Hindi mo lang nababatid
Kung alam mo lang
Na ikaw pala itong manhid
Kasi kung alam mo lang
Matagal ko nang sinabi sa iyo na ‘di ko kaya
Kasi kung alam mo lang
Kaso nga lang natatakot ako na baka sa akin mawala ka
Kung alam mo lang
Tinitiis ko na lang ang lahat kasi baka bigla mong maalala
Na tao lang ako at isa din na umaasa sa tunay na pag-ibig makalasa
Kung alam mo lang
Masakit kung iisipin na
Kailangan ko pang pilitan ka
Na sana’y iyong isipin na
Nakakasakit ka pero kailangan kong ilihim pa
Kasi nga takot ako do’n sa katotohanan
Na baka kaya mo lang na nakakayanang
Manatili pa sa akin kasi wala kang damdaming wawasakin
Paano, iniisip mo yata na ayos lang sa akin
Tao lang ako’t nasasaktan
Napapamahal kaya lahat nasasakyan
Hindi porke’t nakangiti, hindi na nasasaktan
Nag-aalala pa rin ako’t nagdaramdam
‘Di ko tuloy alam kung alam mong mahal kita
Kasi kung alam mo, ‘di mo sa ‘kin ‘to ginagawa
‘Di mo kinakayan-kayanan
Ang aking damdamin na sumusugal, lahat ay tinataya

Kasi kung alam mo lang ano ang pakiramdam ng nasasaktan
Mas maiintindihan mo ang pakiramdam ng nagmamahal
Naranasan mo na ba ang sumugal
Para sa isang relasyon nang ‘di bumigay?
Ang sa ‘kin lang, isipin mo naman ako
Hangga’t kaya ko pang tiisin ang lahat ng ginagawa mo
Kasi kung alam mo lang
Wala akong ibang maisip na idahilan
Kahit palagi mo na lang akong sinasaktan
Sa isip ko napakalabo pa rin kitang palitan
Kahit napakahirap sa ‘kin
Na ikaw ay unawain
‘Pag ‘di mo ‘ko kayang kausapin
‘Di na lang ako kumikibo
Hinihintay kong lumamig ang ulo mo
‘Pag laging nag-iinit sa ‘kin
‘Di mo lang alam ako’y nasasaktan
Kapag lagi mo na lang akong ginaganyan
Manhid ka ba o ‘di ka lang makaramdam?
Kaya ang pagmamahal ko’y ‘di mo na masakyan
Masakit sa pakiramdam ko na kahit gan’to ako sa ‘yo
‘Di naman ako nagkulang
Pero sana bago mo sabihin sa ‘kin ang lahat, naging tayo
Pero ‘di kita sinukuan

Kung alam mo lang, kung alam mo lang
Mga araw kong walang masandalan
‘Di mo lang alam, ‘di mo lang alam
Mga gabi na gusto kitang iyakan
‘Di ka naman nag-alala sa ‘king nararamdaman
‘Di mo man lang naisip na ako’y nasasaktan, palagi naman
Kinasanayan na ikaw ang laging pinagbibigyan, pilitin ko man
Ang puso ko’y ‘di maapektuhan sa ‘yo
Nandito pa rin ako (para sa ‘yo)
Kung alam mo lang, kung alam mo lang
‘Di mo lang alam, ‘di mo lang alam
Paano tayo nagkaganito?
‘Di na tayo magkasundo
Paano mo naisip na (naisip na)
Hindi ako nasasaktan?
Hindi porke’t sinasakyan
Ay hindi na ‘ko nasasaktan
Hindi mo lang alam

Ba’t ba kita nakilala?
Ba’t ba kita nakasama?
Kung ‘di naman ako nagtitiwala sa ‘yo
At okay lang sa ‘kin lahat ng gawin mo
Isipin mo naman, uuwi ka ng umaga
Bakit ngayon mo lang ba ‘ko naalala?
Akala mo siguro na hindi ako umiiyak
Kapag mag-isa lang ako sa kama
Ang tagal ko nang dinadamdam
Akala mo siguro na hindi ako nasasaktan
Sinasakyan lang kita… yeah!

Kasi kung alam mo lang
Matagal ko nang sinabi sa iyo na ‘di ko kaya
Kasi kung alam mo lang
Kaso nga lang natatakot ako na baka sa akin mawala ka
Kung alam mo lang
Tinitiis ko na lang ang lahat kasi baka bigla mong maalala
Kung alam mo lang

Wag nang mag alala; hindi na dadalhin sa kama
Magkatabi't magkaharap ang ating mga mukha
Hawakan mo aking kamay
Unti-unting paibaba
Hinding hindi ka na muli mag-iisa dito
Diba't sabi mo pang matagalan naman na tayo
Panandaliang landian; iwasan maging gago
Lahat ay aking gagawin wag lang tayo magkalayo
Di man tayo gano katagal magkakilala
Pero parang sabi ng puso ko ""ito na nga""
Dalawang kamay mahigpit ang pagkakapit
Subalit; merong pang ibang naiisip
Minsan ay nananaginip
""handa na ba kong magmahal?""
Di pa nga tumamtagal
Naririnig sa aking isip
Tumatawag ka
Ito na ba
Wala na nga
Di na yon mahalaga
Basta ikaw aking kasama
Basta't ikaw aking kasama
Tayong dalawa
Di mag hihiwalay
Basta't magkasabay
Di tayo sasablay
Wag na natin pag usapan kung ano nangyari satin kagabi
Teka sandali
Wag magmadali
Marami pa ang oras para tayong dalawang magkatabi
Ngayon gabi na din ako aamin sa iyo
Hinding hindi ko rin malilimutan ang iyong halik
Bat ganun pa din
Ang lamig lamig
Sa tuwing akoy lalapit
Di mapaghihiwalay
Palapit ng palapit hindi ko rin naman alam
Kung bakit parang tayo dalawa nalang ang nandito sa silid
Di ako bibitaw
Wag nang mag alala
Handa na talaga
Subukan mo naman paminsan na tumaya
Baka sakali ikaw ay sumaya
Hindi ko pa naramdaman ang ganitong saya
Pwede ba
Ikaw ay maiba
Dito ka nalang
Kesa pa masayang
Sabi mo diba
""di ako katulad nila""
Subukang magtiwala na muli
Habang tumatagal ang sandali
Wag magkamali
Wag na  patagalin
Iniwan na sa hangin
Umaasa parin
Tanga parin
Marupok pa rin
Marupok pa rin

Mahal mo pa kahit hindi naman na tayo
Walang iba bastat hindi ka magbabago
Di bale na bastat hindi ito matapos
Sawa ka na
Ayoko na talaga ng bago
Pwede ba maiba ka naman
Pagod na ko maiwan
Di ko na alam kung ano bang patutunguhan
Halika dito
Alisin ang kalungkutan
Mamahalin kita
Hanggang sa dulo
Wala tong hangganan
Pangako sa iyo
Hindi kita iiwan
Kahit pa ilan buwan
Kahit pa nasan ka
Di kita malilimutan
Kahit pa ano ang sabihin ng iba
Basta akin ka
Wala na problema
Wala na problema
Basta akin ka"

Hinahanap ko mula sayo
Oo lang naman, ako ng oo sa iyo
Kasi alam ko sa sarili kong
Masaya ako sa ganto
Wala nang hahanapin pa
Basta ikaw ay nasa piling ko
Kaya please, wag kang aalis
Please lang, wag kang aalis

Wag kang umalis
Dito ka nalang
Sa aking tabi
Kung san ika'y nakangiti
Yeah, aye, yeah, aye
Wag kang umalis
Dito ka nalang
Sa aking tabi
Kung san ika'y nakangiti
Yeah, aye, yeah, aye

Ako'y nag tataka
Kung bakit di mo siya mabitawan
Andito naman ako
Handang saluhin ka kung kailangan
Ilang beses ka niloko
Ba't ka nag mahal ng gago
Kita mo ngayon lahat sira
Pati ang 'yong pagkatao
Wala akong pake kung ako ay masaktan mo
Ang importante lang naman sakin ay ang kasiyahan mo
Ayoko lang kasi ulit makita kang umiiyak
Siya ang kahalikan mo
Pero ba't ako ang sandalan mo
Kayo ang pinagtagpo
Pero sana ako ang tinadhana
Sa iyo, lamang ako
Ang puso at damdamin ko
Ubos nanaman ang yosi at alak na hawak-hawak ko kaya
Sana naman ako'y pakinggan mo
Kapag sinabi kong

Wag kang umalis
Dito ka nalang
Sa aking tabi
Kung san ika'y nakangiti
Yeah, aye, yeah, aye
Wag kang umalis
Dito ka nalang
Sa aking tabi
Kung san ika'y nakangiti
Yeah, aye, yeah, aye"

CUT TO: TAXI
Deadpool sits in the back of a taxi cab. He takes a pamphlet for ‘Haunted Segway Tours’, folds it up, and puts it in his pocket. He plays with the window. He puts his finger in some gum on the ceiling. He tries flicking it off, but it ends up on the camera lense. He picks it off. Cut to the taxi driver. Suddenly, Deadpool sticks his head up front.
DEADPOOL: Kinda lonesome back here.
He begins climbing up into the passenger seat, grunting.
DEADPOOL: Little help?
DOPINDER: Sir, I have to keep my hands on the wheel.
DEADPOOL: Excuse me.
He finishes climbing into the seat and rights himself. The cabbie extends his hand.
DOPINDER: Dopinder.
DEADPOOL: Pool. Dead.
They shake hands. Deadpool notices a picture of a woman on Dopinder’s dashboard.
DEADPOOL: Mmm. Nice.
DOPINDER: Smells good, no?
DEADPOOL: Not the Daffodil Daydream. The girl.
DOPINDER: Ah, yes. Gita. She is quite lovely. She would have made me a very agreeable wife, but, um… Gita’s heart has been stolen by my cousin Bantu. He is as dishonorable as he is attractive.
DEADPOOL: Dopinder, I’m starting to think there’s a reason I’m in this cab today.
DOPINDER: Yes, sir, you called for it, remember?
DEADPOOL: No, my slender, brown friend. Love is a beautiful thing. When you find it, the whole world tastes like Daffodil Daydream.
DOPINDER: Mmm.
DEADPOOL: So you gotta hold onto love. Tight!
Deadpool makes a fist. Dopinder copies him.
DEADPOOL: And never let go. Don’t make the same mistakes I did. Got it?
Dopinder nods.
DOPINDER: Yes.
DEADPOOL: Or else the whole world tastes like Mama June after hot yoga.
DOPINDER: Sir, what does Miss Mama June taste like?
DEADPOOL: Like two hobos fucking in a shoe filled with piss.
DOPINDER: Okay, stop.
DEADPOOL: I can go all day, Dopinder. The point is, it’s bad.
DOPINDER: It’s bad. Uh, why the fancy red suit Mr. Pool?
DEADPOOL: Oh, that’s because it’s Christmas Day, Dopinder. And I’m after someone on my naughty list. I’ve been waiting one year, three weeks, six days, and oh…
He checks his Adventure Time watch.
DEADPOOL: Fourteen minutes to make him fix what he did to me.
DOPINDER: And what did he do to you?
DEADPOOL: This shit.
Deadpool lifts up his mask, revealing his horribly scarred face.
DEADPOOL: Boo!
CUT TO: AIRPORT RUNWAY
Francis sits on top of a crate. A helicopter lands a few yards away. Some men get off. One in particular approaches him. Francis smiles and taps on a crate, standing up.
FRANCIS: They won’t disappoint.
MAN: They better not. What about next month’s shipment?
FRANCIS: There won’t be one. You’re not the only one with a war to win.
MAN: That won’t do.
FRANCIS: See, we’ve had this small disruption to our supply chain.
Francis grabs the man by the throat and lifts him into the air.
FRANCIS: We’d appreciate your patience.
MAN: Okay!
FRANCIS: We’ll deliver in full the following month.
Francis drops the man, who chokes a little.
FRANCIS: Pleasure doing business with you.
He walks away. He and his men leave.
MAN: Fucking mutant.
Some men grab the crates. Francis’s convoy drives off.
CUT TO: TAXI
Deadpool begins patting his costume, looking for something. He looks in the backseat.
DEADPOOL: Aw, shit! I forgot my ammo bag!
DOPINDER: Shall we turn back?
DEADPOOL: Nope, no time. Fuck it. I got this. Nine, ten, eleven, twelve bullets, or bust. We’re here!
Dopinder slams on the breaks. They’re on the middle of a bridge over a highway.
DOPINDER: That’s uh, twenty seven fifty.
DEADPOOL: I, I never carry a wallet while I’m working. Ruins the lines of my suit.
DOPINDER: Oh.
DEADPOOL: But, uh, how ‘bout a crisp high-five!
DOPINDER: Okay.
The high-five.
DEADPOOL: Merry Christmas.
DOPINDER: And a convival Tuesday in April to you too, Mr. Pool!
Deadpool gets out of the cab. Cut to him sitting on the side of the bridge. He’s listening to music and coloring a picture with crayons. Deadpool sings along. We see that the picture he’s drawing is him shooting Francis in the head. He then turns his head to the camera.
DEADPOOL: Wha- Oh! Oh, hello. I know, right? Who’s balls did I have to fondle to get my very own movie? I can’t tell you, but it does rhyme with Pullverine. And let me tell you; (In an Australian accent) he’s got a nice pair of smooth criminals down under. Anyway, I got places to be, a face to fix, and - oh! Bad guys to kill.
Deadpool spots Francis’s convoy.
DEADPOOL: Maximum effort.
He walks off of the side of the bridge, landing in one of the cars in the convoy. He beats all of the men in the car, sending one flying out the back, and barely holding on. Deadpool laughs at him. One of the men takes his head and slams it into a car seat.
DEADPOOL: Rich, corinthian leather.
He beats the man holding him down and snaps his neck.
DEADPOOL: I’m looking for Francis. Have you seen this man?
He holds up his crayon drawing. The man repeatedly shoves Deadpool’s head into the car radio, changing the channel. Someone rides up on a motorcycle next to the car. They fire into the car indiscriminately, killing everyone but Deadpool and the driver. Deadpool kicks the door open, sending the person on the motorcycle flying. The guy holding on to the back of the car starts to pull himself up. Deadpool holds the gas pedal down, and they crash into the car in front of them. Deadpool places both of the men in headlocks. He takes out the cigarette lighter, brand’s one of the men’s foreheads, and shoves it into the man’s mouth, holding his jaw shut.
DEADPOOL: I’ve never said this, but don’t swallow.
Another car pulls up beside them. Inside, men are prepared to shoot. Deadpool swerves the car, causing it to flip and crash. In front of the car, a man on a motorcycle begins shooting. As the car flips, Deadpool grabs the man on the motorcycle by the waist, pulling him into the spinning wreck. Everything slows down for a moment.
DEADPOOL: Shit. Did I leave the stove on?
Everything returns to normal speed. A chain slices the biker’s head off. Another man is sent flying, crashing into a highway sign. Bodies fall out of the car. Finally, the car comes to a stop.
CUT TO: THE X-MANSION
Wide shot of the mansion.
REPORTER: Now, breaking news: A multi car collision turns shots fired on the crosstown expressway this morning. Gridlock has kept police from the scene.
Cut to the kitchen. Colossus is eating cereal and watching the news.
REPORTER: Residents are advised to remain in their homes the assailant appears to be armed, dangerous, and wearing a red suit.
COLOSSUS: Red suit.
He slams his hands on the table, and stands up.
COLOSSUS: Deadpool. Negasonic! Come. We have mission.
Cut to elsewhere in the mansion. Colossus and Negasonic approach a door, which opens automatically.
NEGASONIC: Colossus, wait up.
They approach a plane in the hangar.
COLOSSUS: I’ve given Deadpool every chance to join us. But he’d rather act like a child. A heavily armed child. When will he grow up and see benefits of becoming X-man?
NEGASONIC: Which benefits, the matching unitards? The house that blows up every few years?
COLOSSUS: Please. House blowing up builds character. You ate breakfast, yes? Breakfast is most important meal of day. Here. Protein bar. Good for bones.
He hands her a protein bar.
COLOSSUS: Deadpool may try to break yours.
The plane takes off from the mansion.
CUT TO: HIGHWAY
A number of men get out of their cars with guns and approach the car that Deadpool is in. He rolls down the window and pops his head up.
DEADPOOL: Hey! Oh!
The men begin shooting at him. He puts his dead back down. After a moment they stop. Some of them exchange glances and they all approach the car. Deadpool throws his hands up.
DEADPOOL: Wait! You may be wondering, why the red suit? Well, that’s so bad guys can’t see me bleed. This guy’s got the right idea.
Deadpool points to one of the men.
DEADPOOL: He wore the brown pants.
The man shoots at the car for a moment. Deadpool puts his hands down.
DEADPOOL: Fine! I only have twelve bullets, so you’re going to have to share. Let’s count ‘em down.
He jumps into the air, quickly firing off two shots. The casings say 12 and 11. Two men get shot in the head. The men begin shooting again. One rides past on a motorcycle, shooting as he goes. Deadpool looks down at his arm.
DEADPOOL: Shit.
He holds his arm up, revealing a bullet hole going straight through. Through the hole, he sees the motorcycle coming back.
DEADPOOL: Mother fucker! Ten. (He shoots and misses). Shit! Nine. (He shoots and misses). Fuck! Eight. (He shoots and misses). Shit fuck!
He leaps over the car and takes aim, but loses his chance at a good shot.
DEADPOOL: Bad Deadpool.
He notices one of the men sneaking around the car, unaware that Deadpool is no longer there. Deadpool shoots him in the head.
DEADPOOL: Seven. Good Deadpool.
Another man begins shooting at him. Deadpool hides behind a car. The man reloads. The man shoots some more, then jumps on top of the car to find Deadpool seductively posed. He tries to shoot, but his gun just clicks.
DEADPOOL: Someone’s not counting.
He shoots the man in the head.
DEADPOOL: Six.
A pair of men approaches. One begins to throw a grenade. Deadpool shoots it while it’s still in the man’s hand, causing it to explode and kill both men. The bullet casing says five on it. Deadpool does a celebratory dance. Someone sneaks up behind him and shoots him. Deadpool lies on the ground, pretending to be dead. The man approaches.
DEADPOOL: Four.
He shoots the man from between his legs. He gets up, groaning.
DEADPOOL: Ah! Right up main street.
He walks up to the man he just shot and shoots him twice.
DEADPOOL Three! Two! Stupid! Worth it.
Some more men begin shooting at him. He ducks behind another car. Three men approach. Deadpool jumps over the car and shoots a single bullet, which goes through all three of their heads. The casing says one. Deadpool smells the smoke from his guns.
DEADPOOL: Ooh. I’m touching myself tonight.
Deadpool begins prancing through the wreckage and bodies.
DEADPOOL: Francis! Francis!
He searches one of the cars.
DEADPOOL: What the shit biscuit! Where you at, Francis?
Behind him, one of the men he shot gets up.
DEADPOOL: Ugh. You’re not Francis.
Rather than killing him, the bullet is just lodged in his forehead. He pulls it out and rolls up his sleeves.
DEADPOOL: Really? Rolling up the sleeves?
The man pulls out some knives and charges Deadpool. Deadpool takes out his swords and skewers the man. Everything slows down to a stop.
DEADPOOL: (Narrating) You’re probably thinking, ‘My boyfriend said this was a superhero movie, but this guy in the red suit just turned that other guy into a fucking kebab.’ Well, I may be super, but I am no hero. And yeah, technically, this is a murder. But some of the best love stories start with a murder. And that’s exactly what this is. A love story. And to tell it right, I gotta take you back to way before I squeezed this ass into red spandex.
CUT TO: APARTMENT, TWO YEARS AGO
MERCHANT: Look, what if I slow it down for you? I didn’t order the pizza.
JEREMY: Is this 7348 Red Ledge Drive? Are you Mr. Merchant?
MERCHANT: Yeah, the Mr. Merchant, who didn’t order the fucking pie!
JEREMY: Then who placed the call?
Wade Wilson calls out from the bathroom.
WADE: I did. Pineapple and olive? Sweet and salty.
The delivery boy hands the pizza to Wade.
MERCHANT: Fuck are you? The fuck you doing in my crib?
Wade pulls out a gun. Merchant backs off.
WADE: Is it bread crust?
JEREMY: Oh, God, I hope not.
MERCHANT: Woah, man, look. If this is about that poker game, I told him, I told Howie that uh… Just uh, just take whatever you want.
Merchant hands Wade his wallet.
WADE: Thanks.
JEREMY: Sir, before you do anything to him, mind if I get a big tip?
WADE: Jeremy, is it? Wade Wilson. That is ah, a no go on the tiperoo, Jer. I’m not here for him. I’m here for you.
MERCHANT: Oh, hey, wow, dodged a big time bullet on that one!
WADE: You’re not out of the woods yet. You need to seriously ease-up on the bedazzling. They’re jeans, not a chandelier. P.S., I am keeping your wallet. You did kind of give it to me.
MERCHANT: Hey, look man, can I just have my Sam’s Card -
WADE: I will shoot your fucking cat.
MERCHANT: I don’t even know what that means. I don’t have a cat.
WADE: Then who’s kitty litter did I just shit in?
No one says anything for a moment.
WADE: Anywho, tell me something, what situation isn’t improved by pizza? Do you happen to know a Megan, Orflowsky? Orlavsky? Orlovsky? Am I getting that right?
Jeremy nods.
WADE: Good.
He eats a slice of pizza.
WADE: Cause she knows you. Jeremy, I belong to a group of guys who take a dime to beat a fella down.
Wade hands a piece of pizza to Merchant, who reaches for it, but Wade drops it on the floor.
WADE: And Megan, she’s not made of money, but lucky for her, I got a soft spot.
JEREMY: I’m, uh…
WADE: A stalker. Threats hurt, Jer. But not nearly as much as serrated steel. So keep away from Megan. Cool?
JEREMY: Yes, sir.
WADE: Kay, we’re cool.
JEREMY: Wait, we are?
WADE: Yeah, totally done.
They all start laughing. Wade points to Merchant.
WADE: You should have seen your face!
MERCHANT: I didn’t know what to do. I was so scared.
WADE: Soft spot, remember?
Suddenly, Wade takes Jeremy by the neck and throws him up against the wall.
WADE: Read a book in her general direction again, and you will learn in the worst of ways that I have some hard spots too. That came out wrong. Or did it?
Wade gently kisses Jeremy’s cheek. Jeremy whimpers.
CUT TO: SKATE PARK
A bunch of teenagers are hanging out at a skate park. Wade arrives and walks towards a group of girls, point to one of them.
WADE: Megan.
He throws down a pizza box and some photos of him holding a gun to Jeremy.
WADE: You’ve heard the last of Jeremy. He’s sorry.
MEGAN: No friggin’ way!
DEADPOOL: Shoulda brought my roller blades, show these kids how it’s done.
Megan hugs him.
DEADPOOL: And that’s why we do it. But mostly the money.
GIRL: Think you could fuck up my step-dad?
DEADPOOL: If I give a guy a pavement facial, it’s cause he’s earned it.
He begins to leave.
MEGAN: Hey, wait! You’re my hero.
DEADPOOL: No, no, no, no, no. That I ain't.
CUT TO: SIDEWALK
Wade walks on a sidewalk. As a man walks past him, Wade hits him in the nuts.
WADE: (Narrating) Nope. Never will be.
MAN: Fuck you, Wade.
WADE: (Narrating) I’m just a bad guy who gets paid to fuck-up worse guys.
He enters a building.
WADE: (Narrating) Welcome to Sister Margaret’s. It’s like a job fair for mercenaries. Think of us like really fucked up tooth fairies, except we knock out the teeth and take the cash. You best hope we never see your name on a gold card.
Wade enters a bar. He greets a few men as he walks over to the bartender.
WEASEL: Wade Wilson. Patron saint of the pitiful. What can I do for you?
WADE: I’d love a blowjob.
WEASEL: Oh God, me too.
WADE: The drink, moose knuckle. But first…
Wade takes out a gold card and places it on the bar. Weasel takes it.
WADE: And I ain’t taking any babysitting money, alright? Make sure that gets back to Miss, uh…
WEASEL: Orlovsky?
WADE: Her.
WEASEL: You sure?
WADE: Mhm.
WEASEL: You know, for a merc, you’re pretty warm-blooded. I bet you let the kid of easy, too.
WADE: Oh, he’s not a bad kid, he’s… Just a little light stalking. I was way worse than him when I was his age. I was traveling to exotic places. Baghdad, Mogadishu, Jacksonville. Meeting new and exciting people.
WEASEL: And killing them, yeah. I’ve seen your instagram. So what was special forces doing in Jacksonville?
WADE: That’s classified. They have wonderful T.G.I. Friday’s.
WEASEL: Alright, Kalua, Bailey’s, and whipped cream. I give you: A Blowjob. Ah, why did you make me make that?
Wade gets the attention of one of the waitresses.
WADE: Kelly, Kelly, Kelly, Kelly. Could you bring that over to Bob, please? And tell him it’s from Buck.
WEASEL: Remind me what good will come of this?
WADE: I don’t take the shits, I just disturb them.
Suddenly, there’s a commotion. One of the mercs punches another in the face. A fight breaks out. Wade and Weasel clink glasses.
WADE: Cheers. To your health.
WEASEL: Fuck you.
One of the mercs picks up a stool.
WEASEL: That’s a new stool
The man breaks the stool over another man’s back.One of the mercs gets the better of the other and knocks him to the floor.
MERC: Stay the fuck down.
Weasel walks over.
WEASEL: Alright, move. Move, move, move, move.
He holds a mirror up to the face of the merc on the ground.
WEASEL: Yup. Still breathing.
Many of the people in the bar groan.
WEASEL: Nobody wins today. Nice try, Wade.
WADE: You got me. I picked Boothe in the dead pool. Who’d you pick?
WEASEL: You know, Wade, uh, um…
WADE: No… You did not bet on me to die.
He looks up at a chalkboard above the bar that has all of the information for the dead pool.
WADE: You bet on me to die. Wow. Mother fucker, you’re the world’s worst friend. But joke’s on you. I’m living to 102, and then dying, like the city of Detroit.
WEASEL: I’m sorry, I just wanted to win money. I never win anything.
WADE: Oh, whatever. Soldiers of fortune, drinks on me!
Everyone in the bar cheers and raises their glasses to Wade.
WEASEL: Domestic! Nothing imported.
A woman approaches Wade.
VANESSA: Woah, woah, woah, woah, baby. You sure you wanna shoot your full wad?
WADE: Uh… Tight.
VANESSA: Vanessa.
WADE: Wade. What’s a nice place like you doing in a girl like this?
One of the other mercs slaps her ass.
MERC: I’d hit that.
WADE: You’d best apologize, before…
Vanessa tightly grabs the mercs balls.
WADE: … Yeah. That.
VANESSA: Say the magic words, fat Gandalf.
MERC: I’m sorry.
WADE: Breath through the nose
MERC: I don’t have a filter between my brain and my-
Vanessa grabs his balls even harder.
WADE: Hey, woah, hakuna his tatas! He’s sorry. Get out of here, go. Go cast a spell.
Wade puts his hand on Vanessa.
VANESSA: Hey, hands off the merchandise.
WADE: Merchandise, oh. So you uh… Warm fuzzys for money?
VANESSA: Yep.
WADE: Rough childhood?
VANESSA: Rougher than yours. Daddy left before I was born.
WADE: Daddy left before I was conceived.
VANESSA: Ever had a cigarette put out on your skin?
WADE: Where else do you put one out?
VANESSA: I was molested.
WADE: Me too. Uncle.
VANESSA: Uncles. They took turns.
WADE: I watched my own birthday party through the keyhole of a locked closet, which also happens to be -
VANESSA: Your bedroom. Lucky. I slept in a dishwasher box.
Wade gasps.
WADE: You had a dishwasher! I didn’t even go to sleep. It was pretty much 24/7 ball gags, brownie mix and clown porn.
Vanessa laughs.
VANESSA: Who would do such a thing?
WADE: Hopefully you. Later tonight? Hey, what… What can I get for, uh… $275 and a yogurt lite rewards card?
VANESSA: Maybe about forty-eight minutes of whatever the fuck you want.
She puts the yogurt gift card in Wade’s mouth and walks away. Wade follows her.
WEASEL: Did she just put a gift card in your mouth?
CUT TO: ARCADE
Shot of what appears to be Wade on top of Vanessa.
WADE: It’s time to put balls in holes. You said whatever I want.
VANESSA: I get it.
Camera angle changes to shot of them in front of skeeball machines.
VANESSA: You love skeeball. Apparently more than you love vagina.
WADE: It’s a tough call. I just want to get to know the real you. Not the short, 2-dimensional sex object peddled by Hollywood.
VANESSA: Balls in holes.
WADE: Balls in holes. Prepare to lose tragically.
VANESSA: Bring it, big man.
WADE: Okay.
Rather than rolling the ball, Wade throws it directly into the hole labelled ‘100’.
VANESSA: Ruh-roh.
WADE: Ruh-roh.
Cut to wade walking up to the Arcade counter with a ton of tickets.
WADE: A limited edition, Voltron: Defender of the Universe ring, por favor. I’ve had my eye on this sucker for a while.
VANESSA: And I will take the pencil eraser.
ARCADE EMPLOYEE: Okay. You are now the proud protector of the planet. And you, can erase stuff, written in pencil.
WADE: M’lady?
He takes her arm and they walk away.
VANESSA: Well, I hate to break it to you, but your 48 minutes are up.
WADE: Hey, how many more minutes could I get for this? FYI, five mini-lion bots come together to form one super-lion bot.
VANESSA: (Excitedly) Five mini-lion bots? Three minutes.
WADE: What do we do with the remaining two minutes, thirty seven seconds?
VANESSA: Cuddle?
Cut to them having sex.
VANESSA: How long can you keep this up?
WADE: All year?
Cut to them having sex on a bed covered in rose petals.
VANESSA: Happy Valentine’s Day.
Cut to them having sex in a room lit by red lanterns.
WADE: Happy Chinese New Year.
VANESSA: Year of the Dog.
Cut to Wade looking stressed in bed.
VANESSA: Relax. And happy International Women’s Day.
WADE: Ah! Nope, nope, nope.
Cut to them sitting in chairs and reading.
WADE: Happy Lent.
Cut to Wade eating her out.
VANESSA: Ow, Wade!
He sticks his head up. He’s wearing plastic vampire teeth.
WADE: Happy Halloween.
He takes out the teeth.
WADE: Happy Halloween.
She laughs. Cut to them having sex on a table covered in food. She shoves some mashed potatoes into his mouth.
VANESSA: Happy Thanksgiving.
WADE: I love you.
Cut to Vanessa sitting in bed. Wade approaches her.
WADE: If your left leg is Thanksgiving and your right leg is Christmas, can I visit you between the holidays?
He pulls the sheets off of her. She’s wearing an ugly Christmas sweater.
WADE: Ugh, that sweater is terrible! But, it looks good on you.
VANESSA: Red’s your color. Brings out the bloodshot in your eyes.
WADE: Listen, I’ve been thinking.
VANESSA: Really?
WADE: About why we’re so good together.
VANESSA: Why’s that?
WADE: Well, your crazy matches my crazy. And we’re like two jigsaw pieces, you know? Um… Weird, curvy edges.
VANESSA: Put them together and you can see the picture on top. Wade, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you, but only because you haven’t gotten around to asking me. Will you, um… Stick it it my -
WADE: Marry me?
He holds up a ring-pop.
VANESSA: Uhh... Jinx? Where were you hiding that?
Shot of Wade’s bare ass.
WADE: Nowhere. I spent one month’s salary, so…
VANESSA: You mean it?
WADE: I do.
VANESSA: That’s my line.
They kiss.
VANESSA: I love you, Wade Wilson.
WADE: So that’s a… You’re s’posed to -
VANESSA: Yes!
WADE: Yes! Ha ha ha! I feel just like a little girl!
They spoon in bed.
WADE: What if I just held on and never let go?
VANESSA: Ride a bitch’s back like Yoda on Luke?
WADE: Oh, Star Wars jokes…
VANESSA: Empire.
WADE: Jesus Christ, it’s like I made you in a computer.
They kiss. He picks up a camera and takes a picture of them.
WADE: Hey. Perfect. Pee break. Shake it, yeah.
She shakes the picture to dry it off. He gets up to pee.
WADE: (Narrating) Here’s the thing. Life is an endless series of trainwrecks with only brief commercial like breaks of happiness. This had been the ultimate commercial break.
He finishes peeing and walks back to bed, taking his shirt off.
WADE: (Narrating) Which meant it was time to return to our regularly scheduled program.
He falls over on the floor, passing out.
VANESSA: Oh, my God! Wade!
CUT TO: HOSPITAL
Shot of an X-Ray of Wade’s body. There are a number of pinkish blobs. Cut to Wade and Vanessa sitting in a doctor’s office.
WADE: You’re clowning. You’re not clowning? I sense clowns.
DOCTOR: People react to news of late-stage cancer differently. There are certainly options we can look into. Drugs are being developed every day.
Wade and Vanessa look at each other.
VANESSA: So what do we do? Surely there must be something we can do. My uncle Ivan was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and all these new experimental drugs…
Her voice fades out. Wade looks at her.
WADE: (Narrating) Vanessa’s already working on plan A, B, all the way through Z. Me? I’m memorizing the details of her face. Like it’s the first time I’m seeing it. Or the last.
DOCTOR: Mr. Wilson. Mr Wilson? Take your time to process this. It’s important not to do anything rash.
CUT TO: BRIDGE
Cut back to the carnage on the bridge. Deadpool is skewering a guy with his swords, and cuts him in half. He puts his sword away.
DEADPOOL: Now, if I were a two-hundred pound sack of assholes named Francis, where would I hide? Oh.
A motorcycle starts. He turns around. The motorcycle speeds past him, shooting. Deadpool jumps into the air, throwing his sword into the front wheel of the motorcycle. The biker flies off. Deadpool walks over.
DEADPOOL: A hush falls over the crowd. Rookie sensation Wade W. Wilson out of Regina, Saskatchewan lines up the shot. His form looks good.
Deadpool kicks the biker in the chest, sending him back down.
DEADPOOL: And that's why Regina rhymes with fun. Ladies and gentlemen, what you're witnessing is sweet, dick-kicking revenge.
Deadpool continues beating the biker.
DEADPOOL: Oh! Giving him the business.
He throws the biker to the side of the bridge.
DEADPOOL: Incoming!
He kicks the biker's helmet off, revealing it to be Francis.
DEADPOOL: This is taking unsportsmanlike conduct to a whole new level!
He stabs his sword through Francis's shoulder and into the bridge barrier, pinning him down.
DEADPOOL: Looking good, Francis. Well rested. Like you've been pitching, not catching. Ringing any bells? No?
He lifts his mask up.
DEADPOOL: How about now?
FRANCIS: Huh. Wade fucking Wilson. Well hello, gorgeous.
DEADPOOL: Yeah, like I got bit by a radioactive Sharpei. Yeah, and whose fault is that, Francis? Time to undo what you did to this butterface.
FRANCIS: You should thank me. Apparently I made you immortal. I'm actually quite jealous.
DEADPOOL: Yeah, but this ain't a life worth living, is it? Now, I'm about to do to you what Limp Bizkit did to music in the late '90s.
Colossus walks up behind Deadpool. Deadpool raises his hand, hitting Colossus in the crotch. He feels around for a second.
DEADPOOL: Dad?
Colossus throws him into a car.
DEADPOOL: (Narrating) I think we can all agree that shit just went sideways in the most colossal way.
Cut to an action figure of Deadpool from the Wolverine Origins movie.
DEADPOOL: (Narrating) Well, maybe not the most.
CUT TO: WADE & VANESSA'S APARTMENT
WADE: Now this is my most prized possession.
He picks up and album by Wham!
VANESSA: Wham?
WADE: No, no, no, no. Wham! Make It Big is the album that George and Andy earned the exclamation point.
VANESSA: So, am I supposed to just smile and wave you out the door?
WADE: Think of it like spring cleaning. Only, if spring was death. God, if I had a nickel for every time I spanked it to Bernadette Peters.
He picks up a coin bag with Bernadette Peters on it. Vanessa takes it and shakes it.
VANESSA: Sounds like you do. Bernadette is not going anywhere, because you're not going anywhere! Drink.
She hands him a glass.
WADE: You're right. Cancer's only in my liver, lungs, prostate, and brain. All things I can live without.
VANESSA: You belong here at home. Surrounded by your Ultron, and your Bernadette, and your me.
WADE: Listen, we both know that cancer is a shitshow. Like, Yakoff Smirnoff opening for the Spin Doctors at the Iowa State Fair, shitshow. And under no circumstances will I take you to that show. I want you to remember me. Not the ghost of Christmas me.
VANESSA: Well, I want to remember us!
WADE: I swear to God, I'm gonna find you in the next life, and I'm gonna boombox Careless Whisper outside your window. Wham!
VANESSA: No one is boomboxing shit, okay?
She sits down next to him.
VANESSA: We can fight this. Besides, I just realized something. You win. Your life is officially way more fucked up than mine.
WADE: I love you.
They start making out.
CUT TO: BAR
Wade walks in.
WEASEL: Wade.
Wade sits at the bar.
WADE: Wease.
WEASEL: You look like you need a blowjob and a shower. Courtesy calls for the latter first.
WADE: Yeah, how about three shots of Patron?
WEASEL: Yeah, how about Triticum aestivum? Wheat grass. Excellent for the immune system.
WADE: Jesus Christ, you sound like Vanessa. Here, check it out. She's sending away for all these colorful clinic brochures.
He pulls out a bunch of brochures.
WADE: I'm sure they're all FDA approved. Chechnya. Isn't that where you go to get cancer? We've got China, and central Mexico. You know how they say cancer in spanish?
WEASEL: How?
WADE: El cancer.
WEASEL: Oh. I could have guessed that. Look how happy you look here?
He shows Wade the picture he took of himself and Vanessa.
WEASEL: Mind if I keep this? Put it up, so I can remember? When you looked alive. At least now I'm gonna win the dead pool, now that you're gonna die tragically of cancer.
WADE: Thanks.
WEASEL: Oh, and that guy over there came in looking for you.
He hands wade a card with a number on it.
WEASEL: Real grim reaper type. I dunno. Might further the plot.
Wade walks over to the man and sits down.
MAN: Ah! Mr. Wilson.
WADE: How can I help you? Besides luring children into a panel van.
MAN: I understand you've recently been diagnosed with terminal cancer.
WADE: Stalker alert.
MAN: My job. Recruitment. I'm sorry you've had such a tough go. But you're a fighter. Special forces, forty-one confirmed kills.
WADE: One every seven weeks. At that rate, most folks get a haircut.
He takes a sip of his drink.
WADE: It's to wash the taste out. Of being so... impressive.
MAN: And now you spend your days sticking up for the little people.
WADE: People change. What do you want?
MAN: I represent an organization of people that may be able to help. What if I told you we can cure your cancer? And what's more, give you abilities most men only dream of.
WADE: I'd say that you sound like an infomercial. But not a good one, like Slapchop, more Shakeweighty.
Wade makes a shakeweight gesture.
MAN: The world needs extraordinary soldiers. We won't just make you better. We will make you better than better. A superhero.
WADE: Look, Agent Smith. I tried the superhero business and it left a mark. But if I ever hit, 'Fuck it', I'll hit you up. Oh, uh, shit. We're within 500 yards of a school, so you may wanna... You know. Yeah.
Wade gets up and leaves, going back over to the bar.
WADE: His drinks on him.
CUT TO: WADE AND VANESSA'S APARTMENT
Wade sits in a chair.
VANESSA: Hey, what's going on?
WADE: Hey, sorry. I had a Liam Neeson nightmare. I dreamt I kidnapped his daughter and he just wasn't having it.
He gets into bed.
WADE: Hey, uh, they made three of those movies. At some point you have to wonder if he's just a bad parent.
Cut to Wade packing.
WADE: (Narrating) The worst part about cancer isn't what it does to you. But what it does to the people you love. Who knew if this guy could save my life. But I knew there was only one way I could save hers.
He leaves.
WADE: (Narrating) Isn't that what superheroes do?
Wade calls the man.
CUT TO: BRIDGE
Deadpool is frozen midair after Colossus threw him.
DEADPOOL:  Okay. Let's pro-con this superhero thing. Pro: they pull down a gaggle of ass. Dry cleaning-discounts, lucrative film deals both origin stories and larger ensemble team movies. Con: They're all lame-ass teacher's pets.
COLOSSUS: You know I can hear you.
DEADPOOL: I'm not talking to you. I was talking to them.
He points at the camera.
COLOSSUS: (To Francis) Stay right here. You've been warned before, Deadpool. This is a shameful and reckless use of your powers. You will both be coming with us.
DEADPOOL: Look, Colossus! I don't have time for the goody-two-shoes bullshit right now! And... you are?
NEGASONIC: Negasonic Teenage Warhead.
DEADPOOL: Negasonic Teenage... What the shit? That's the coolest name ever! So what, you're like his sidekick?
COLOSSUS: No, trainee.
DEADPOOL: Let me guess. X-men left you behind on, what, shit detail?
NEGASONIC: What does that make you?
DEADPOOL: Pretending you're not here, Negasonic Teenage Warhead. Trade names?
He punches Francis.
NEGASONIC: Can we go?
DEADPOOL: Look! I'm a teenage girl! I'd rather be anywhere than here. I'm all about long, sullen silences, followed by mean comments, followed by more silences. So what's it gonna be, huh? Long sullen silence, or mean comment? Go on.
NEGASONIC: You've got me in a box here.
DEADPOOL: Ah-hah!
COLOSSUS: We can't allow this Deadpool. Please, come quietly.
DEADPOOL: You big, chrome, cock-gobbler!
COLOSSUS: That's not nice.
DEADPOOL: You're really gonna fuck this up for me? Trust me. That wheezing bag of dick tips has it coming! He's pure evil! Besides, nobody's getting hurt!
The body that splattered onto the highway sign falls off. The three of them turn to look.
DEADPOOL: That guy was already up there when I got here.
COLOSSUS: Wade, you're better than this! Join us! Use your powers for good.
Deadpool tosses a metal disk at Francis, hitting him in the face.
DEADPOOL: Heads up.
COLOSSUS: Be a superhero!
DEADPOOL: Listen, the day I decide to become a crime-fighting shit-swizzler, who rooms with a bunch of other little whiners, at the Neverland mansion of some creepy, old, bald, Heaven's Gate-looking mother fucker, on that day... I'll send your shiny happy ass a friend request. But until then, I'm gonna do what I came here to do. Either that, or slap the bitch out of you.
COLOSSUS: Wade...
NEGASONIC: Hey -
DEAPOOL: Zip it, Sinead!
NEGASONIC: Hey, douchepool!
DEADPOOL: And I hope you're watching!
He turns around to point at Francis, who is no longer there. He gasps.
COLOSSUS: Quite unfortunate.
Deadpool looks back and forth at where Colossus is and where Francis was.
DEADPOOL: That does it!
He jumps up and hits Colossus's head, breaking his hand.
DEADPOOL: Oh, Canada! That's not good.
COLOSSUS: Wade, please.
DEADPOOL: Cock shot!
With his good hand, he punches Colossus in the crotch. This does nothing but break his hand.
DEADPOOL: Oh, your poor wife!
COLOSSUS: You really should stop.
He holds his broken hands in front of him.
DEADPOOL: All the dinosaurs feared the T-rex.
He flips up into the air, breaking his foot upon contact with Colossus's head. Negasonic laughs.
DEADPOOL: Ah! I promise this gets worse for you, big boy!
COLOSSUS: This is embarrassing. Please, stay down.
DEADPOOL: You ever hear of the one-legged man in the ass-kicking contest?
Deadpool gets up and hops on one leg, holding his other three broken limbs up.
COLOSSUS: Do you have off switch?
DEADPOOL: Yeah, it's right next to the prostate. Or is that the on switch?
COLOSSUS: Enough!
Colossus hits him into a car. Negasonic laughs. Deadpool moans in pain. Colossus handcuffs him and drags him along.
COLOSSUS: Let us go talk to the professor.
DEADPOOL: McAvoy or Stewart? These timelines are so confusing. Dead or alive you're coming with me!
COLOSSUS: You will recover, Wade. You always do.
Deadpool snaps his arm back into place and takes out a knife.
DEADPOOL: (To the camera) You ever see 127 Hours? Spoiler alert.
Deadpool begins cutting his own hand off, escaping the handcuffs.
NEGASONIC: Oh, my God. Nasty.
A spurt of blood hits Colossus in the face.
DEADPOOL: Oh, there's the money shot, baby! Are you there, God? It's me, Margaret.
Deadpool flips off of the bridge and lands in a truck passing underneath. His hand, still in the handcuff, is flipping off Colossus. Cut to Deadpool in the back of the truck.
DEADPOOL: Rock, meet Bottom. When life ends up breath-takingly fucked, you can generally trace it back to one big, bad decision.
CUT TO: DIMLY LIT FACILITY
WADE is on a stretcher.
WADE: (Narrating) The one that sent you down the road to shittsburgh. This, well, this was mine.
MAN: Mr. Wilson, nothing warms my heart more than a change of someone else's. You finally hit, 'Fuck it'.
WADE: Just promise me you'll do right by me. So I can do right by someone else.
MAN: Of course.
WADE: And please don't make the super suit green. Or animated!
Wade is brought into a large room with a lot of other people. One woman has spikes on her back. Another is bleeding and panting.
WADE: This place seems sanitary. My first request is warmer hands.
Some men put him on a chair and strap him down.
WADE: And, Jesus, a warmer table! You should really come up with a safe word fellas. I'm thinking pork and beans.
A woman comes by and pushes his head down, strapping him in.
WADE: Aren't you a little strong for a lady? I'm calling wang. What's up with the matches? Oral fixation? Or just a big Stallone fan?
She puts her hand over his mouth.
FRANCIS: Patience, Angel.
She removes her hand.
FRANCIS: All in good time.
WADE: Are you here for the turn down service or what?
FRANCIS: We have another talker.
WADE: I'm just excited about my first day at super hero camp.
ANGEL: Shut the fuck up.
She puts a rag over his mouth. Francis inspects him.
FRANCIS: Mr. Wilson, my name's Ajax. I manage this workshop. My welcome speech used to be filled with euphemisms like, 'This may hurt a little'. 'This may cause you some discomfort'. But I've grown blunt. This workshop is not a government led program. It's a private institution that turns reclamation projects like yourself into men of extraordinary abilities. But if you think super human powers are acquired painlessly, well... I'm injecting with a serum that activates any mutant genes lurking in your DNA. For it to work we need to subject you to extreme stress.
Francis puts an IV into Wade's arm and turns on a machine. A blue liquid begins to flow through.
FRANCIS: You've heard the whole, make an omelette break some eggs thing, right? I'm about to hurt you, Wade. I was a patient here once myself, you know. The treatment affects everyone differently. It made Angel inhumanly strong. In my case, it enhanced my reflexes, and scorched my nerve endings so I not longer feel pain. And in fact, I no longer feel anything.
Wade starts mumbling. Angel removes his gag.
WADE: Thank you! Thank you. You have something in your teeth. Just in the middle there. Romaine lettuce, or something. It's been bothering me for a long time.
Francis checks his teeth.
WADE: Ha! Made you look. Hey, is Ajax your actual name? Because it sounds suspiciously made up. What is it really? Kevin? Ruth? Scott? Mitch? Dexter? Is it Basil Fawlty?
FRANCIS: Joke away. The one thing that never survives this place is a sense of humor.
WADE: We'll see about that.
FRANCIS: I suppose we will. He's all yours.
Francis leaves.
WADE: Oh, come on. You're going to leave me all alone here with less angry Rosie O'Donnell?
She punches him. A montage of experiments on Wade begins, with Francis narrating.
FRANCIS: This is how it's going to work. Adrenaline acts as a catalyst for the serum, so we're going to have to make you suffer. If you're lucky, your mutant genes will activate and manifest in spectacular fashion. If not, well, we'll have to keep hurting you. In new and more painful ways, each more different than the last. Until you finally mutate. Or die.
Cut to Wade talking with another man.
WADE: Got a bucket list? I'd really like to light a spliff off of the Olympic Torch.
CUNNINGHAM: Pass it to me right after.
WADE: Let's not forget naked tandem base jumping with the WNBA Sacramento Monarchs.
CUNNINGHAM: Anything on my bucket list would involve public nudity.
WADE: Giving Meredith Baxter Birney a dutch oven.
CUNNINGHAM: No, receiving a dutch oven from Meredith Baxter Birney. Making banana pancakes for my kids.
WADE: Vanessa. I wanna see Vanessa.
FRANCIS: Lovely. I don't know about anyone else, but I'm touched.
CUNNINGHAM: We're just joking.
FRANCIS: No, no. It's okay. I encourage distractions. Wouldn't want you giving up on us, now would we?
WADE: Hey, don't take any shit from him, Cunningham. How tough can he be, with a name like Francis.
CUNNINGHAM: Francis?
WADE: That's his legal name. He got Ajax from the dish soap. F, R, A, N, C, I, oops! I snabbed the dry-cleaning tag off your lab coat. FYI, I could probably get you the super hero discount.
FRANCIS: You are so relentlessly annoying.
WADE: Thanks. Never heard that before.
FRANCIS: Why don't you do us all a favor and shut the fuck up? Or I'll sow your pretty mouth shut.
WADE: Oh, I wouldn't do that if I were you. See, here's the problem with round-the-clock torture. You can't really step it up from there.
FRANCIS: Is that what you think?
Cut to Wade being strapped down in a machine.
FRANCIS: If this doesn't unlock your mutation, well... Nothing will. Now, what we're going to do is lower the oxygen concentration in there to the exact point you feel like you're suffocating. If your brain waves slow, meaning you're about to pass out, then we'll turn up the O2. If your heart rate slows, meaning you're able to catch your breath, we'll turn it back down. And that's where we'll leave you. Right there.
WADE: Ugh, I thought you guys were dicks before.
FRANCIS: You know the funniest part of all this? You still think we're making you a super hero. You, a dishonorable discharge hook deep in hookers? You're nothing. Our secret, mate, is that this workshop doesn't make super heroes. We make super slaves. We're gonna fit you with a control collar and auction you off to the highest bidder. Who knows what they'll have you do. Terrorizing citizens, putting down freedom fighters. Maybe just mow the occasional lawn.
WADE: What the fuck is wrong with you?
FRANCIS: You're never going home after this. now there's a brave face.
WADE: Wait, wait! Seriously, you actually have something in your teeth now.
FRANCIS: Enjoy your weekend.
WADE: Weekend? Back up, weekend?
Francis starts the machine. Wade begins choking. Cut to night. His whole body begins to transform.
WADE: (Narrating) Did I say this was a love story? No, it's a horror movie.
Wade begins screaming. Cut to day time. Francis comes back and turns off the machine.
FRANCIS: Fucking hell. Looks like someone lost his shot at homecoming king.
WADE: What have you done to me?
FRANCIS: I've merely raised your stress levels high enough to trigger a mutation.
WADE: You sadistic fuck!
FRANCIS: I've cured you, Wade. Now your mutated cells can heal anything. It's attacking your cancer as fast as it can form. You know, I've seen some of the side effects before. I could cure them. But where's the fun in that? Now I'm gonna shut you in again Wade. Not because I need to. Because I want to. Ah, well. Go ahead.
Angel fiddles with the straps.
ANGEL: You smell like shit.
Wade head butts her.
ANGEL: Mother fucker -
FRANCIS: Hey, hey, hey! It's alright! It's alright. I think we owe him that, yeah? Take off. Go on, off you go. Quick question. What's my name? Didn't think so.
He closes the machine and turns it on.
WADE: (Narrating) Sorry, Francis, my lips are sealed.
In the machine, Wade reveals that he took a match from Angel. He lights it and throws it towards the oxygen vent. After a few moments, the machine explodes, causing massive damage to the facility and starting a fire. Francis comes down with a fire extinguisher. He sees that Wade escaped from the machine. Wade charges him with a metal pipe and they begin fighting.
FRANCIS: You don't wanna kill me! I'm the only one that can fix your barking mug!
They continue fighting. Francis gains the upper hand and skewers Wade with a metal pipe, bending it to prevent him from getting up.
FRANCIS: What's my name?
Francis leaves.
CUNNINGHAM: Wade...
Wade looks up to see Cunningham. Cut to much later, after the fire has died out. Wade rises up out of the dirt and rubble.
WADE: (Narrating) I didn't just get the cure to el cancer. I got the cure to el everything. But there was only one thing that really mattered.
CUT TO: STREET
Vanessa walks down a sidewalk. Wade follows her. A lot of people give him strange looks. He watched Vanessa purchase something at a market and follows her to her apartment. She enters, but he walks away.
CUT TO: BAR
WADE: No way. I'm not making her life as ugly as mine, man.
WEASEL: Oh, come on, Wade. It can't be that bad.
WADE: Ah, bullshit! I'm a monster inside and out. I belong in a fucking circus!
WEASEL: Wade, Vanessa loves you. She doesn't care what you - Oh. Oh.
WADE: Do you like what you see?
WEASEL: No. You look like an avocado had sex with an older, more disgusting avocado.
WADE: Yeah.
WEASEL: And not gently. Like, it was hate fucking. There was something wrong with the relationship, and that was the only catharsis they could find without violence.
WADE: And the only guy who can fix this fugly mug is the brown shitstick from the mutant factory, and he's gone! Poof.
WEASEL: Yeah, you've got to do something to remedy this, cause as of now you only have on course of action.
WADE: Damn straight. Find Francis -
WEASEL: Star in horror films.
WADE: What?
WEASEL: Star in your own horror films. Cause you look like Freddy Krueger face fucked a topographical map of Utah.
WADE: Here's what I'm actually going to do. I'm going to work through his crew until somebody gives up Francis, force him to fix this, put a bullet in his skull, and fuck the brain hole.
WEASEL: I don't want to see that or think of it again. But the douchebag does think you're dead, right?
WADE: Yeah.
WEASEL: That's good. You should keep it that way.
WADE: What, like, wear a mask?
WEASEL: Yes, a very thick mask, all the time. I am sorry, you are... haunting. Your face is the stuff of nightmares.
WADE: Like a testicle with teeth.
WEASEL: You will die alone. If, I mean, if you could die. Ideally. For others' sake.
WADE: That'll do.
WEASEL: All you need now is a suit and a nickname, like Wade the Wisecracker, or Scaredevil, Mr. Neverdie... Oh shit.
WADE: What?
WEASEL: I put all my money on you, and I just realized I'm never going to win the -
WADE: Deadpool. Captain Deadpool. No, just Deadpool. Yeah.
WEASEL: Yeah. To you, Mr. Pool. That sounds like a fucking franchise.
The clink glasses. Cut to a Deadpool making his costume.
DEADPOOL: This shit's gonna have nuts in it.
He attacks some guys, shouting 'Where's Francis?' Back at his apartment, he realizes his clothes are covered in blood. Cut to him in a laundry mat. An old blind woman addresses him.
AL: Seltzer water and lemon for blood. Or wear red. Dumbass.
Cut to him making a new, red costume. Cut to him interrupting a boxing match and attacking a man there.
DEADPOOL: Don't make me ask twice. Where's Francis?
Cut to him in his apartment, stabbing a picture of the man.
DEADPOOL: He made me ask twice. Is it the mask?
Cut to him making the newest costume. Cut to a montage of him killing people and asking where Francis is. Cut to an ice rink. A man is bleeding and crawling on the floor. Deadpool follows him with a Zamboni and laughs.
DEADPOOL: You're about to be killed by a Zamboni!
Back to the montage of killing people, and shouting various insults at people. Finally, Deadpool only has one person left to track down; the man who recruited him. Cut to that man recruiting another man. He gives the man a card and leaves with two guards. Deadpool confronts them.
DEADPOOL: Nice to see you, Jared. I'll take the footlong. Fully loaded.
The man runs away. Deadpool kills the two guards and catches up.
DEADPOOL: 41 confirmed kills. Now it's 89. About to be 90.
MAN: Mr. Wilson?
DEADPOOL: Ding ding!
MAN: You're looking very... alive.
DEADPOOL: Ha! Only on the outside.
MAN: This isn't going to end well for me.
DEADPOOL: This is not gonna end well for you, no. Where's your boss?
MAN: I can tell you exactly -
DEADPOOL: Ah, da, da, da, da ,da ,da, da. Oh, you'll tell me. But first, you might want to look away for this.
Deadpool pushes the camera away.
DEADPOOL: Now this little piggy went to...
MAN: Ah!
Cut back to Deadpool's apartment. He sticks a knife in a picture of the recruiter.
DEADPOOL: Thank you, Agent Smith.
Cut to Deadpool leaving his apartment and hailing a cab. Dopinder is inside.
DOPINDER: Hop in!
Deadpool gets in, then addresses the camera.
DEADPOOL: And we all know how this turned out.
Fast-forward through the cab drive and the bridge fight scene. Deadpool is holding a unicorn plushie and masturbating.
DEADPOOL: Whoops! You weren't meant to see that.
Rewind to him escaping Colossus and ending up in the truck.
DEADPOOL: There. All caught up.
CUT TO: OUTSIDE DEADPOOL'S APARTMENT
Deadpool gets out of the truck.
DEADPOOL: Sorry about bleeding in all of your garbage! Seltzer water and lemon for blood. Whoo! Some kinds of anger can't be managed. Like the kind where your year-long plan ends with the wrong guy getting dismembered! That said, when it comes time for licking wounds, there's no place like home. And I share that home with someone you've met. The old blind lady from the laundry mat, Al.
AL: God, I miss cocaine.
DEADPOOL: Her. Ah! Fourth wall break in a fourth wall break. That's like... sixteen walls! She's like Robin to my Batman, except she's old. And black. And blind. And I think she's in love with me. Wait, I'm pretty sure Robin loves Batman too.
He knocks on the door. Al goes to answer it, but trips and falls.
DEADPOOL: Al?
He opens the door.
DEADPOOL: Good morning, sleepy head. It smells like old lady pants in here.
AL: Yes, I'm old, I wear pants.
DEADPOOL: But you're no lady.
Deadpool takes off his shoes and puts crocs on.
DEADPOOL: Oh! So comfy.
AL: Upside of being blind, I've never seen you in crocs.
DEADPOOL: You mean my big rubber masturbatin' shoes?
AL: Yes, I know. Downside of being blind. I hear everything in this duplex.
DEADPOOL: Sit on a stick.
AL: Bactine?
DEADPOOL: Yeah. Bactine should do it.
He lifts up his hand, which is slowly starting to grow back. Al is assembling furniture.
DEADPOOL: How's that Cunen coming along? IKEA doesn't assemble itself, you know.
AL: You're telling me. I don't mind the Cunen. It's an improvement on the Holdall.
DEADPOOL: Please. Anything's an improvement over the Holdall. I'd have taken and Emness or a Tristes over the Holdall. No, I didn't get excited until I saw the Cunen.
AL: Screw please.
DEADPOOL: Here? Now? Just kidding, I know it's been decades.
AL: You'd be surprised.
DEADPOOL: Pretty grossed out.
AL: Ta da.
She finishes the furniture and sits down. After a moment, it completely falls apart.
AL: I wish I'd never heard of Craigslist.
DEADPOOL: And I quote, 'Looking for blind and likes imperfections, must be good with hands.' Or would you rather I build the ikea and you pay rent?
AL: Why so douchy this morning?
DEADPOOL: Let's recap. The cock-thistle that turned me into this freak slipped through my arms today. Arm. Catching him my only chance to be hot again, get my super sexy ex back, and prevent this shit from happening to someone else. So yeah, today was about as much fun as a sand paper dildo.
He's grabbed some lube and a unicorn plushie. As he walks by Al into his room, he loudly farts.
DEADPOOL: Hashtag drive by.
CUT TO: WAREHOUSE
Francis pulls up outside. Inside, Angel is getting some super slaves ready. Francis walks in.
FRANCIS: Found out who our friend in the red suit is.
Cut to Angel repairing his clothes.
FRANCIS: Fucking Wade Wilson. Of course, I'd wear a mask too with a face like that. I only wish I healed the same. Still. We'll put him out of our misery. On our terms.
ANGEL: Right. And when he heals?
FRANCIS: He can't. Not if there's nothing left of him to heal. You know, it's funny. I almost missed the fucker. I like a challenge. But he's bad for business. Now let's go and find him.
CUT TO: DEADPOOL'S APARTMENT
Deadpool sits on the couch. Al comes over with a drink.
AL: Tylenol PM?
DEADPOOL: I'd stick that where you stuck the Bactine. I raided my stash of wisdom teeth Percocet and I am orbiting fucking Saturn right now.
He strokes her chin with his hand, which looks like a baby's hand.
DEADPOOL: I appreciate the gesture.
AL: Am I crazy, or is your hand really small?
DEADPOOL: It's about the size of a KFC spork.
AL: I get why you're so pissy. But your mood's never going to right until you find this woman and tell her how you feel!
DEADPOOL: I keep telling you, Mrs. Magoo, she wouldn't have me! If you could see me, you'd understand.
AL: Looks aren't everything.
DEADPOOL: Looks are everything! You ever heard David Beckham speak? It's like he mouth-sexed a can of helium! You think Ryan Reynolds got this far on his superior acting method?
AL: Love is blind, Wade.
DEADPOOL: No. You're blind.
AL: So you're just gonna lie there and whimper?
DEADPOOL: No, I'm gonna wait till this arm plows through puberty, and then I'm gonna come up with a whole new Christmas Day plan. In the meantime, you might wanna leave the room. I bet it feels huge in this hand. Go, go, go, go, go ,go.
She begins to get up.
CUT TO: THE BAR
Weasel is telling a joke to some men.
WEASEL: So the doctor says, 'Well the bad news is, you don't have that much time to live?' He says, 'How long do I have?' The doctor says, 'Five.' The guy says, 'Five what?' The doctor says, 'Four, three, two...'
He and the men laugh. Weasel notices that Francis, Angel, and some of their men have come in.
WEASEL: Can I help you ladies?
FRANCIS: Well, I sure hope so. I heard you might be able to point me in the direction of a, um... A friend of mine. Name of Wade Wilson.
WEASEL: Sorry. I don't know the name.
Angel reaches and grabs something on the back wall.
WEASEL: Hey, you're not supposed to be behind the bar.
ANGEL: I recognize that girl.
FRANCIS: This must be Vanessa. I've heard so much about you.
Angel holds Weasel up against the wall. Everyone in the bar pulls out a gun and points it at her.
WEASEL: Um, sweetheart, you might want to look around. This isn't really the place to do something like that.
FRANCIS: Easy, Angel. Put the little man down.
She puts Weasel down.
FRANCIS: We have everything we need now.
WEASEL: You sure? You don't want any clothes that aren't monochromatic? Have fun at your midnight showing of Blade 2.
Angel and Francis leave.
WEASEL: Woo. Thanks for having my back, guys.
He calls Deadpool.
WEASEL: Wade, we have a fucking problem. And by we, I mean you.
CUT TO: STREET
Deadpool and Weasel walk down a sidewalk.
DEADPOOL: I can't believe I'm doing this. Is there a word for half afraid, half angry?
WEASEL: Yeah, afrangry, I guess. Do you know what you're going to say to her?
DEADPOOL: Ugh, fuck me.
WEASEL: Uh, I'd maybe not start with that.
They enter a strip club.
DJ: Hey, coming up on stage right now, give it up for Chastity!
WEASEL: Or, as I like to call her, irony.
DEADPOOL: We've got to find her fast, before numbnuts does.
WEASEL: How do you know she's in here?
DEADPOOL: Cause I'm constantly stalking the fox.
Weasel gets distracted by a stripper. Deadpool searches and eventually finds Vanessa.
DEADPOOL: (Narrating) Every time I see her, it's like the first time. Especially from this angle.
He approaches her, but stops short of getting her attention and instead walks away.
DJ: You can't find love, but you can rent it for three minutes!
Cut to Deadpool washing his face in the bathroom.
DEADPOOL: You weak motherfucker! Come on. Come on, get it together. This isn't about me, this is about Vanessa. Here we go. Maximum effort.
Cut back to the club.
MAN: Vanessa! Someone out back asking for you. Something about an old boyfriend.
Cut to an alley out back. Vanessa walks out and sees someone in the shadows.
VANESSA: I knew it was you. The weird curvy edges. Like a jigsaw puzzle.
The man walks out of the shadows. It's Francis, not Deadpool.
FRANCIS: You have Wade Wilson to thank for this.
She tries running, but Angel knocks her out. Cut back into the club. Deadpool approaches Weasel.
DEADPOOL: Hey, hey! Where'd she go?
WEASEL: I saw her head to the back. Go get her tiger.
Cut to Deadpool entering the alley out back. He finds his old coin purse on the ground.
DEADPOOL: Fuck... Mother fucker!
CUT TO DEADPOOL'S APARTMENT
Deadpool is yelling. Weasel tries to calm him down. Deadpool knocks over and beats up a dummy.
DEADPOOL: Chocolate! Jimminy! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Oh, I'm gonna rip this mother fucking -
A phone begins to ring.
DEADPOOL: Find that! Find that, I'm going to get angry!
Weasel gets the phone.
WEASEL: Here, it says Vanessa. No, wait, it's Francis. He says he wants you to come to him.
DEADPOOL: What is that?
WEASEL: That's the shit emoji. You know, it's the turd with the smiling face and the eyes. I thought it was chocolate yogurt for so long.
DEADPOOL: I need guns.
WEASEL: Okay, which ones.
DEADPOOL: I need all the guns!
WEASEL: Alright.
Cut to a montage of Deadpool, Weasel, and Al getting guns from all over the house.
WEASEL: That's about 3000 rounds.
DEADPOOL: Well, we all know what I can do with twelve.
Al comes in holding a gun, pointed at Weasel and Deadpool.
WEASEL: Woah, woah, woah.
DEADPOOL: Careful with that, Ronnie Milsap. We're downrange.
AL: I was gonna spend the night assembling the Volgie, but this is holding my interest.
DEADPOOL: I told you, we're going with the Oordvash, not the Bjorsha, get it through your head or get outta fuck town!
AL: Shit. That's all the pieces in the house.
DEADPOOL: Na, na, na, na, na. Let's go, cough it up. Up, up, up, up, up.
She pulls her pant leg up to reveal a gun.
DEADPOOL: Ugh, down, down, down.
AL: Fuck you.
WEASEL: Five cal. I like it. Wade. I'd go with you, but, I don't wanna.
DEADPOOL: Listen, Al. If I never see you again, I want you to know that I love you very much. Oh, and also, there's about 116 kilos of cocaine buried somewhere in the apartment, right next to the cure for blindness. Good luck.
WEASEL: Wanna get fucked up?
CUT TO: LARGE PLATFORM
Angel and Francis lead a bound and gagged Vanessa on the platform.
FRANCIS: Put her down over here.
Angel ties her up.
FRANCIS: Go on then.
Angel removes the gag.
VANESSA: Thanks, dickless. And I mean you.
FRANCIS: Well. You're a talker too? You and Wade.
VANESSA: I've been trying to tell you assholes you've got the wrong girl. My old boyfriend, he's dead.
FRANCIS: See, I thought that too. But he keeps on coming back. Like a cockroach. Ugly. Now, I may not feel, but he does. Let's see how he fights with your head on the block.
CUT TO: THE X-MEN MANSION
Deadpool runs up to knock on the door, but Negasonic opens it before he can.
DEADPOOL: Ripley! From Alien 3!
NEGASONIC: Fuck, you're old.
DEADPOOL: Ha! Fake laugh, hiding real pain. Go get silver balls.
NEGASONIC: You guys going for a bite? Early bird special?
DEADPOOL: Oh, like there's something wrong with eating before sundown or saving money. No, you know that bad guy that you let go? He's got my girl. You're gonna help me get her back.
COLOSSUS: Wade, is that you?
DEADPOOL: It's me, Deadpool, and I got an offer that you can't refuse! I'm gonna wait out here, okay? Big house. It's funny that we only ever see two of you. It's almost like the studio couldn't afford another x-man.
CUT TO: TAXI
Dopinder is driving. Deadpool is in the passenger seat. Colossus and Negasonic are in back.
DEADPOOL: And that is why, in my opinion, the movie cocoon is pure pornography.
DOPINDER: Who brought this twinkly man?
DEADPOOL: Twinkly, but deadly. My chrome-penised friend back there has agreed to do me this solid. In exchange, I told him I would consider joining his boy band.
COLOSSUS: It's not boy band.
DEADPOOL: Sure it's not. Ah! So, any luck winning Gita back?
DOPINDER: I tried to Mr. Pool, but Bantu is more craftier and handsomer than me.
DEADPOOL: Well, I think you're pretty darn cute.
The cab drives over a pothole. A scream can be heard from the trunk.
DEADPOOL: Dopinder.
DOPINDER: Hmm?
DEADPOOL: What was that?
DOPINDER: Uh, that was, uh... Bantu, in the trunk.
COLOSSUS: Ban-who?
DOPINDER: My romantic rival, Bantu. He's tied up in the trunk. I'm doing like you said, DP. I'm going to gut him like a tenduri fish, then put his carcass on Gita's doorstep.
DEADPOOL I did not tell him to do that! Absolutely not! It got lost in translation! Dopinder, this is no way to win Gita's heart back! (I'm so proud of you). Drop Bantu off, safe and gentle like. (Kill him). And then win Gita back! The old fashioned way, with your boyish charm. (Kidnap her).
NEGASONIC: He's super dead.
DOPINDER: Oh!
Dopinder parks the taxi.
DOPINDER: I presume a crisp high five?
DEADPOOL: For you? Ten! Okay guys, let's get out there and make a difference! (You know what to do).
He and Dopinder give each other thumbs up.
DOPINDER: Knock 'em dead, pool boy!
DEADPOOL: Time to make the chimi fucking changas. Not often a dude ruins your face, wall stomps your sanity, grabs your future baby-momma, and personally sees to four of your five shittiest moments. Let's just say, it's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.
The trio approaches the large platform.
NEGASONIC: Hey, where's your duffel bag?
Deadpool turns around. Cut to the taxi. Dopinder gets a call from Deadpool. He tries to answer it, causing the car to crash. Bantu starts screaming.
DOPINDER: Bantu?
Cut back to the platform.
DOPINDER'S VOICE: Leave a message, and have a happy day!
DEADPOOL: God damn it! I'm gonna do this the old fashioned way. With two swords and maximum effort. Cue the music.
The trio starts walking again. A bunch of men with guns come out. Francis calls out from atop the platform.
FRANCIS: Wade Wilson! What's my name?
DEADPOOL: Ooh, I'mma fucking spell it out for you.
FRANCIS: Go get some.
DEADPOOL: Superhero landing, she's gonna do a superhero landing, wait for it!
Angel does a superhero landing.
DEADPOOL: Woo! Superhero landing. You know, that's really hard on your knees. Totally impractical. They all do it. You're a lovely lady, but I'm saving myself for Francis. That's why I brought him.
COLOSSUS: I'd prefer not to hit a woman, so please, pla -
Angel hits Colossus, sending him flying.
DEADPOOL: I mean... That's why I brought her?
Negasonic is on her phone.
DEADPOOL: Oh, no, finish your tweet. Just give us a second. There you go, hashtag it. Go get her tiger.
Negasonic runs forward in a firey ball, throwing Angel back.
DEADPOOL: Oh, I so pity the dude who pressures her into prom sex.
ANGEL: Alright then. Fire!
The men with guns start shooting. Negasonic and Deadpool hide behind cover. Colossus gets back up and throws a giant tire, hitting some of the men.
DEADPOOL: Finish fucking her the fuck up!
COLOSSUS: Language, please!
DEADPOOL: Suck a cock!
Colossus and Angel start fighting.
DEADPOOL: Look away, child. Look away!
Deadpool rips off his underwear, then holds it up as a flag of surrender.
DEADPOOL: Wait! Wait!
The men stop shooting.
DEADPOOL: Hey, you only work for that shit spackled muffin fart! So, I'mma give y'all a chance to lay down your firearms, in exchange for preferential, borderline gentle, possibly lover-like treatment.
They start shooting again.
DEADPOOL: Fine! Commando.
Deadpool runs out and fights a bunch of the guys. Cut back to Angel and Colossus fighting. Cut back to Deadpool killing a bunch of guys. Negasonic uses her power to crush a few guys. Cut back to Colossus and Angel fighting. Cut back to Deadpool killing guys. Suddenly, he stop just short of killing one.
DEADPOOL: Bob?
BOB: Wade?
DEADPOOL: Oh, my God, I haven't seen you since -
BOB: Jacksonville. TGI Friday's.
DEADPOOL: TGI Friday's!
He puts his swords away.
DEADPOOL: What the hell! Come here you.
He head butts Bob, knocking him out.
DEADPOOL: How are the kids? Good? And Gale, she still fixing that tuna casserole? So good. Bad for the waistline if you know what I mean.
Cut to Colossus. He lifts a large object off of Angel Dust. Her boob has fallen out of her shirt. He awkwardly looks away... covering the breast from camera view with his hand.
COLOSSUS: You are, uh... Very beautiful woman.
ANGEL: You are so sweet! Thanks.
She takes the opportunity to punch him in the crotch. Cut to Deadpool, who has arranged the bodies of the soldiers he killed into the word 'FRANCIS'.
FRANCIS: Does he write you notes too? He's such a romantic.
DEADPOOL: Don't worry, baby. I'm coming.
FRANCIS: Fire!
The men on the platform begin shooting. Deadpool runs out of range.
NEGASONIC: Hey! Climb on.
Deadpool nods and runs over. She uses her power to shoot him up onto the platform. He approaches Francis, who has Vanessa in the oxygen depravation machine.
DEADPOOL: Motherfucker should have worn his brown pants. You're right, beautiful! Red really is my color.
VANESSA: Wade?
DEADPOOL: Don't worry, baby. I'm gonna get you out of that shitbox.
FRANCIS: What better way to get inside that head of yours.
DEADPOOL: Oh, you never left.
VANESSA: But you did, asshole!
FRANCIS: Ah, take a deep breath darling. Oh wait, wrong choice of words.
He turns the machine on. She begins choking.
DEADPOOL: I hope they've blocked pain to your every last nerve, cause I'mma go looking!
FRANCIS: You grow back body parts now, Wade? When I'm finished, parts'll have to grow back you.
DEADPOOL: Good one. Yeah, that was a good one. Let's dance. And by dance, I mean let's try to kill each other.
They begin fighting. A some point, Deadpool throws one of his swords, cracking the glass of the machine. Vanessa starts being able to breathe. Cut to Angel and Colossus fighting. She begins choking him. Cut to Vanessa, who uses the sword to free herself.
FRANCIS: Fine, fists.
DEADPOOL: Sounds like your last Saturday night.
They start fighting again. Francis stabs a knife into Deadpool's head. Vanessa runs up with the sword and skewers Francis. Deadpool looks up at her and hallucinates a bunch of small cartoon creatures. Francis throws Vanessa. Deadpool takes the knife out of his head. Cut back to Angel and Colossus. Negasonic uses her power to create a massive explosion, causing the platform to begin to fall. Francis gets thrown off by a crate. Deadpool and Vanessa start to slide off.
VANESSA: Wade!
DEADPOOL: I got you, baby. I got a plan, but you're not gonna like it.
He puts her in the machine. They begin dangling off the edge.
DEADPOOL: Don't worry, I'm totally on top of this.
The platform begins falling down more rapidly. Colossus carries Angel and Negasonic out of the rubble.
DEADPOOL: Damn it! Maximum effort!
He flings the machine with Vanessa inside it out of the way of the platform, as the platform falls down. completely. Later, Colossus finds the machine in the rubble, with Vanessa still alive inside. Negasonic helps her out.
COLOSSUS: Just take it slow.
DEADPOOL: Yoo-hoo! Oh, my God, that was so awe -
Deadpool stands on top of some rubble nearby. Suddenly, Francis tackles him from the side, sending them tumbling down. They begin fighting. Deadpool has the upper hand, audibly breaking bones.
DEADPOOL: There are no words... Me and you... Are headed to fix this butterface.
FRANCIS: What? You stupid fucking idiot. Did you really think there was a cure for that?
DEADPOOL: What?
FRANCIS: You heard me.
DEADPOOL: No, no! So you mean to say, after all this, you cant fix me.
FRANCIS: It sounds a bit stupider when you say it
DEADPOOL: Like the kind of stupid who admits he can't do the one thing I'm keeping him alive for?
Deadpool pulls out a gun and puts it to Francis's head.
DEADPOOL: Any last words?
FRANCIS: What's my name?
DEADPOOL: Who fucking cares?
COLOSSUS: Wade! Four or five moments.
DEADPOOL: I'm sorry?
COLOSSUS: Four or five moments. That's all it takes.
DEADPOOL: To...?
COLOSSUS: Be a hero. Everyone thinks it's a full-time job. Wake up a hero, brush your teeth a hero, go to work a hero. Not true! Over a lifetime, there are only four or five moments that really matter. Moments when you're offered a choice. To make a sacrifice, conquer a flaw, save a friend. Spare an enemy. In these moments, everything else falls away. The way the world sees us, the way we -
Deadpool shoots Francis in the head. Colossus vomits.
COLOSSUS: Why?
DEADPOOL: You were droning on! Sure, I may be stuck looking like pepperoni flatbread, but at least fuckface won't heal from that. If wearing superhero tights means sparing psychopaths, then maybe I wasn't meant to wear 'em. Not everyone monitors a hall like you.
COLOSSUS: Just promise -
DEADPOOL: Yeah, yeah, I'll be on the lookout for the next four moments. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm just a boy about to stand in front of a girl. And tell her... What the fuck am I going to tell her?
COLOSSUS: Well, heh, you better figure it out.
DEADPOOL: I can't even tell you -
Vanessa punches him.
DEADPOOL: I deserve that.
She punches him again.
DEADPOOL: That too.
She lifts her knee up. He covers his crotch.
DEADPOOL: No, no, no, no, maybe not the nethers.
VANESSA: Start talking!
DEADPOOL: I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. For everything. I'm sorry for leaving, I'm sorry for not cowboying up sooner. It's been a rough couple of years.
VANESSA: Rough?
DEADPOOL: I live in a crack house. With a family of 12. Every night we spoon for warmth. Everyone fights for Noelle, she's the fattest. There's nothing that we don't share. Floorspace, dental floss, even condoms.
VANESSA: So you live in a house?
DEADPOOL: I should have come and found you sooner. But baby, the guy under this mask, he ain't the same one you remember.
VANESSA: You mean this mask?
She takes off his mask.
DEADPOOL: And this one.
He has a picture of Hugh Jackman stapled to his face.
DEADPOOL: And this one. In case the other fell off. Just, yeah, ow, like a bandaid, just give it a good - Audi 5000! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Are you sure?
VANESSA: I'm sure.
She takes off the paper.
VANESSA: Wow.
DEADPOOL: Yeah.
VANESSA: Hey, after a brief adjustment period, and a bunch of drinks, it's a face I'd be happy to sit on.
DEADPOOL: I'm not the same underneath this suit either. Super penis.
COLOSSUS: Come on Wade, language. Young one is present.
DEADPOOL: What are... What are you still doing here? Get out of here, go make yourself useful! You, go be a really big brother to someone. Tell Beast to stop shitting on my lawn. And you, chicken noodle, nothing compares to you. Sinead O'Connor, 1990.
NEGASONIC: That's alright. You're cool.
Deadpool gasps.
DEADPOOL: What in the ass! That was not mean! I'm proud of you.
COLOSSUS: We will make an x-man of you yet, Wade.
DEADPOOL: You know, for a second there, it felt like we were three mini lion robots coming together to form one super robot.
NEGASONIC: There's the stupid.
DEADPOOL: Yeah. And now, for the moment I've all been waiting for.
VANESSA: Come here.
They start making out.
DEADPOOL: Wham! As promised.
They keep making out.
DEADPOOL: (Narrating) See? You don't need to be a superhero to get the girl. The right girl will bring out the hero in you. Now, let's finish this epic wide shot, pull out, there we go, looks nice, it's gonna be the only thing pulling out tonight. Who doesn't love a happy ending? Till next time, this is your friendly neighborhood pool guy, saying, I'm never gonna dance again, the way I dance with you...
His voice fades out.
END CREDITS
POST-CREDITS SCENE: HALLWAY
DEADPOOL: You're still here? It's over, go home. Oh, you're expecting a teaser for Deadpool 2. Well, we don't have that kind of money. What, are you expecting Sam Jackson to show up, with an eye patch and a saucy little leather number? Go home! Oh! But I can tell you one thing, and it's a bit of a secret: We're gonna have Cable. Amazing character, mechanic arm, time travel. We have no idea who we're gonna cast yet, but it could be anybody. Just need a big guy with a flat top. Mel Gibson, Dolph Lundgren, Keira Knightley. She's got range, who knows. Big secret. Shh. Oh, and don't leave your garbage lying around. It's a total dick move. Chicka-chicka.

Bawat hakbang ay kalkulado at bilang
Na para bang kinabisado ang daan
Bat di na lang matuto sa nakaraan

Paikot ikot lang naman ang lakaran

Sige sige sige
Sige sige lang, pasa lang
Binigay lahat ng inaasam
Matagal ko namamasdan
Wag asahan ang mga ibang timang
Nag-cocopyahan na nagkakalat
Nag-yayabang na nagtutulak
Galawang alat, walang hinatnat
Kami nag bubuklat ng mga utak
Kala nila sobrang simple
Timplahan mo nga para matindi
Kitang kita mga inggit sa gilid
Nanggigitgit ang mga ngipin
Shrooms shrooms, tumutulong sakin para silipin
Gumising sa katotohan
Respetuhin ang sarili
Wag pa alipin
(Verse 4 MNL$)
Glue inside the crown
Now, I want gold teeth
Po peep, go sleep
Count sheep on your two feet
I'm flowing like I’m Bruce Lee
I got two sleeves
I'm dressing like a boutique
My third eye with a cool reach
I dance on two feet
Where afterparty? (aftertheparty)
The audience with no speech
I don’t do this for free
I write digital loose leaf
I’m clean like some new sheets
Somebody give me new beat
My 8 bar complete

Sana ay makayanan ko nang tumingin
Sa iyong mata
Sa tuwing magkasama
Nanginginig ang labi
Damdamin 'di masabi sa’yo
Paano ba 'to?

Baka ikaw ay mawala

Sawa na ako na itago ang damdaming ito
Di na ako mapakali kasi nais ko sanang
Marinig ang matamis mong oo, oo, oo, oo
Ang matamis mong oo, oo, oo

Pagdating ng Lunes
Papasok na ganado kasi may sasabihin ako
Sa iyo. (sabihin sa’yo)
Pwede ba kitang alagaan
Gagawin ang lahat para ika’y mapasakin

Pangako sayo gagawin ang lahat
Ako’y gagalaw kahit na may lagnat
Sa’yo titingin kahit na madilim
Makita ka lang, ako ay gagaling
Di ka iiwan, di pababayaan
Sa isang minuto nasa harapan
Sa kin ka kumapit, wag kana matakot
Kasama kita, sa mundo tayo’y lilibot
Yeah
Kapag kasama ka
Lungkot mawawala
Handa kong ipakita ang barahang dala
Ako’y nasa ulap na
Ayokong bumaba
Buhay sisigla ‘pag nakikita kita

Die Räuber gelagert auf einer Anhöhe unter Bäumen, die Pferde weiden den Hügel hinunter.
Moor. Hier muß ich liegen bleiben. (Wirft sich auf die Erde.) Meine Glieder wie abgeschlagen. Meine Zunge trocken wie eine Scherbe. (Schweizer verliert sich unvermerkt.) Ich wollt' euch bitten, mir eine Handvoll Wassers aus diesem Strome zu holen, aber ihr seid alle matt bis in den Tod.
Schwarz. Auch ist der Wein all in unsern Schläuchen.
Moor. Seht doch, wie schön das Getreide steht! – Die Bäume brechen fast unter ihrem Segen. – Der Weinstock voll Hoffnung.
Grimm. Es gibt ein fruchtbares Jahr.
Moor. Meinst du? – Und so würde doch ein Schweiß in der Welt bezahlt. Einer? – – Aber es kann ja über Nacht ein Hagel fallen und Alles zu Grund schlagen.
Schwarz. Das ist leicht möglich. Es kann Alles zu Grund gehen, wenig Stunden vorm Schneiden.
Moor. Das sag' ich ja. Es wird Alles zu Grund gehn. Warum soll dem Menschen Das gelingen, was er von der Ameise hat, wenn ihm Das fehlschlägt, was ihn den Göttern gleich macht? – oder ist hier die Mark seiner Bestimmung?
Schwarz. Ich kenne sie nicht.
Moor. Du hast gut gesagt und noch besser gethan, wenn du sie nie zu kennen verlangtest! – Bruder – ich habe die Menschen gesehen, ihre Bienensorgen und ihre Riesenprojecte – ihre Götterplane und ihre Mäusegeschäfte, das wunderseltsame Wettrennen nach Glückseligkeit; – Dieser dem Schwung seines Rosses anvertraut – ein Anderer der Nase seines Esels – ein Dritter seinen eigenen Beinen; dieses bunte Lotto des Lebens, worein so Mancher seine Unschuld und – seinen Himmel setzt, einen Treffer zu haschen, und – Nullen sind der Auszug – am Ende war kein Treffer darin. Es ist ein Schauspiel, Bruder, das Thränen in deine Augen lockt, wenn es dein Zwerchfell zum Gelächter kitzelt.
Schwarz. Wie herrlich die Sonne dort untergeht!
Moor (in den Anblick versenkt). So stirbt ein Held! – Anbetenswürdig!
Grimm. Du scheinst tief gerührt.
Moor. Da ich noch ein Bube war – war's mein Lieblingsgedanke, wie sie zu leben, zu sterben wie sie – (mit verbissenem Schmerz.) Es war ein Bubengedanke!
Grimm. Das will ich hoffen.
Moor (drückt den Hut übers Gesicht). Es war eine Zeit – Laßt mich allein, Kameraden!
Schwarz. Moor! Moor! Was zum Henker? – Wie er seine Farbe verändert!
Grimm. Alle Teufel! was hat er? wird ihm übel?
Moor. Es war eine Zeit, wo ich nicht schlafen konnte, wenn ich mein Nachtgebet vergessen hatte –
Grimm. Bist du wahnsinnig? Willst du dich von deinen Bubenjahren hofmeistern lassen?
Moor (legt sein Haupt auf Grimms Brust). Bruder! Bruder!
Grimm. Wie? sei doch kein Kind – ich bitte dich –
Moor. Wär ich's – wär ich's wieder!
Grimm. Pfui! pfui!
Schwarz. Heitre dich auf. Sieh diese malerische Landschaft – den lieblichen Abend.
Moor. Ja, Freunde! diese Welt ist so schön.
Schwarz. Nun, das war wohl gesprochen.
Moor. Diese Erde so herrlich.
Grimm. Recht – recht – so hör' ich's gerne.
Moor (zurückgesunken). Und ich so häßlich auf dieser schönen Welt – und ich ein Ungeheuer auf dieser herrlichen Erde.
Grimm. O weh, o weh!
Moor. Meine Unschuld! meine Unschuld! – Seht! es ist Alles hinausgegangen, sich im friedlichen Strahl des Frühlings zu sonnen – Warum ich allein die Hölle saugen aus den Freuden des Himmels? – Daß Alles so glücklich ist, durch den Geist des Friedens Alles so verschwistert! – Die ganze Welt eine Familie und ein Vater dort oben – Mein Vater nicht – ich allein der Verstoßene, ich allein ausgemustert aus den Reihen der Reinen – mir nicht der süße Name Kind – nimmer mir der Geliebten schmachtender Blick – nimmer, nimmer des Busenfreundes Umarmung. (Wild zurückfahrend.) Umlagert von Mördern – von Nattern umzischt – angeschmiedet an das Laster mit eisernen Banden – hinausschwindelnd ins Grab des Verderbens auf des Lasters schwankendem Rohr – mitten in den Blumen der glücklichen Welt ein heulender Abbadonna!
Schwarz (zu den Übrigen). Unbegreiflich! ich hab' ihn nie so gesehen.
Moor (mit Wehmuth). Daß ich wiederkehren dürfte in meiner Mutter Leib! daß ich ein Bettler geboren werden dürfte! – Nein! ich wollte nicht mehr, o Himmel – daß ich werden dürfte wie dieser Taglöhner einer! – O ich wollte mich abmüden, daß mir das Blut von den Schläfen rollte – mir die Wollust eines einzigen Mittagsschlafs zu erkaufen – die Seligkeit einer einzigen Thräne.
Grimm (zu den Andern). Nur Geduld, der Paroxysmus ist schon im Fallen.
Moor. Es war eine Zeit, wo sie mir so gern flossen – o ihr Tage des Friedens! du Schloß meines Vaters – ihr grünen schwärmerischen Thäler! O all ihr Elysiums-Scenen meiner Kindheit! – werdet ihr nimmer zurückkehren – nimmer mit köstlichem Säuseln meinen brennenden Busen kühlen? – Traure mit mir, Natur – Sie werden nimmer zurückkehren, nimmer mit köstlichem Säuseln meinen brennenden Busen kühlen. – Dahin! dahin, unwiederbringlich! –
Schweizer mit Wasser im Hut.
Schweizer. Sauf zu, Hauptmann – hier ist Wasser genug, und frisch wie Eis.
Schwarz. Du blutest ja – was hast du gemacht?
Schweizer. Narr, einen Spaß, der mich bald zwei Beine und einen Hals gekostet hätte. Wie ich so auf dem Sandhügel am Fluß hintrolle, glitsch! so rutscht der Plunder unter mir ab und ich zehn rheinländische Schuh lang hinunter – da lag ich, und wie ich mir eben meine fünf Sinne wieder zurechtsetze, treff' ich dir das klarste Wasser im Kies. Genug diesmal für den Tanz, dacht' ich, dem Hauptmann wird's wohl schmecken.
Moor (gibt ihm den Hut zurück und wischt ihm sein Gesicht ab). Sonst sieht man ja die Narben nicht, die die böhmischen Reiter in deine Stirne gezeichnet haben – dein Wasser war gut, Schweizer – diese Narben stehen dir schön.
Schweizer. Pah! hat noch Platz genug für ihrer dreißig.
Moor. Ja, Kinder – es war ein heißer Nachmittag – und nur einen Mann verloren – mein Roller starb einen schönen Tod. Man würde einen Marmor auf seine Gebeine setzen, wenn er nicht mir gestorben wäre. Nehmet vorlieb mit diesem. (Er wischt sich die Augen.) Wie viel waren's doch von den Feinden, die auf dem Platz blieben?
Schweizer. Hundert und sechzig Husaren – drei und neunzig Dragoner, gegen vierzig Jäger – dreihundert in Allem.
Moor. Dreihundert für Einen! – Jeder von euch hat Anspruch an diesen Scheitel! (Er entblößt sich das Haupt.) Hier heb' ich meinen Dolch auf. So wahr meine Seele lebt! Ich will euch niemals verlassen.
Schweizer. Schwöre nicht! Du weißt nicht, ob du nicht noch glücklich werden und bereuen wirst.
Moor. Bei den Gebeinen meines Rollers! Ich will euch niemals verlassen.
Kosinsky kommt.
Kosinsky (vor sich). In dieser Revier herum, sagen sie, werd' ich ihn antreffen – he, holla! was sind das für Gesichter? – sollten's – wie? wenn's Diese – sie sind's, sind's! – ich will sie anreden.
Schwarz. Gebt Acht! wer kommt da?
Kosinsky. Meine Herren! verzeihen Sie! Ich weiß nicht, geh' ich recht oder unrecht?
Moor. Wer müssen wir sein, wenn Sie recht gehn?
Kosinsky. Männer!
Schweizer. Ob wir das auch gezeigt haben, Hauptmann?
Kosinsky. Männer such' ich, die dem Tod ins Gesicht sehen und die Gefahr wie eine zahme Schlange um sich spielen lassen, die Freiheit höher schätzen als Ehre und Leben, deren bloßer Name, willkommen dem Armen und Unterdrückten, die Beherztesten feig und Tyrannen bleich macht.
Schweizer (zum Hauptmann). Der Bursche gefällt mir. – Höre, guter Freund! du hast deine Leute gefunden.
Kosinsky. Das denk' ich und will hoffen, bald meine Brüder. – So könnt ihr mich denn zu meinem rechten Manne weisen, denn ich such' euern Hauptmann, den großen Grafen von Moor.
Schweizer (gibt ihm die Hand mit Wärme). Lieber Junge! wir dutzen einander.
Moor (näher kommend). Kennen Sie auch den Hauptmann?
Kosinsky. Du bist's – in dieser Miene – wer sollte dich ansehen und einen Andern suchen? (Starrt ihn lange an.) Ich habe mir immer gewünscht, den Mann mit dem vernichtenden Blicke zu sehen, wie er saß auf den Ruinen von Carthago – jetzt wünsch' ich es nicht mehr.
Schweizer. Blitzbub!
Moor. Und was führt Sie zu mir?
Kosinsky. O Hauptmann! mein mehr als grausames Schicksal – ich habe Schiffbruch gelitten auf der ungestümen See der Welt, die Hoffnungen meines Lebens hab' ich müssen sehen in den Grund sinken, und blieb mir nichts übrig, als die marternde Erinnerung ihres Verlustes, die mich wahnsinnig machen würde, wenn ich sie nicht durch anderwärtige Thätigkeit zu ersticken suchte.
Moor. Schon wieder ein Kläger gegen die Gottheit! – Nur weiter.
Kosinsky. Ich wurde Soldat. Das Unglück verfolgte mich auch da – ich machte eine Fahrt nach Ostindien mit, mein Schiff scheiterte an Klippen – nichts als fehlgeschlagene Plane! Ich hörte endlich weit und breit erzählen von deinen Thaten, Mordbrennereien, wie sie sie nannten, und bin hieher gereist dreißig Meilen weit, mit dem festen Entschluß, unter dir zu dienen, wenn du meine Dienste annehmen willst – Ich bitte dich, würdiger Hauptmann, schlage mir's nicht ab!
Schweizer (mit einem Sprung). Heisa! Heisa! So ist ja unser Roller zehnhundertfach vergütet! Ein ganzer Mordbruder für unsre Bande!
Moor. Wie ist dein Name?
Kosinsky. Kosinsky.
Moor. Wie, Kosinsky? weißt du auch, daß du ein leichtsinniger Knabe bist und über den großen Schritt deines Lebens weggaukelst, wie ein unbesonnenes Mädchen – Hier wirst du nicht Bälle werfen oder Kegelkugeln schieben, wie du dir einbildest.
Kosinsky. Ich weiß, was du sagen willst – Ich bin vier und zwanzig Jahr alt, aber ich habe Degen blinken gesehen und Kugeln um mich surren gehört.
Moor. So, junger Herr? – Und hast du dein Fechten nur darum gelernt, arme Reisende um einen Reichsthaler niederzustoßen, oder Weiber hinterrücks in den Bauch zu stechen? Geh, geh! du bist deiner Amme entlaufen, weil sie dir mit der Ruthe gedroht hat.
Schweizer. Was zum Henker, Hauptmann! was denkst du? willst du diesen Hercules fortschicken? Sieht er nicht gerade so drein, als wollt' er den Marschall von Sachsen mit einem Rührlöffel über den Ganges jagen?
Moor. Weil dir deine Lappereien mißglücken, kommst du und willst ein Schelm, ein Meuchelmörder werden? – Mord, Knabe, verstehst du das Wort auch? Du magst ruhig schlafen gegangen sein, wenn du Mohnköpfe abgeschlagen hast, aber einen Mord auf der Seele zu tragen –
Kosinsky. Jeden Mord, den du mich begehen heißt, will ich verantworten.
Moor. Was? bist du so klug? Willst du dich anmaßen, einen Mann mit Schmeicheleien zu fangen? Woher weißt du, daß ich nicht böse Träume habe, oder auf dem Todbett nicht werde blaß werden? Wie viel hast du schon gethan, wobei du an Verantwortung gedacht hast?
Kosinsky. Wahrlich! noch sehr wenig, aber doch diese Reise zu dir, edler Graf!
Moor. Hat dir dein Hofmeister die Geschichte des Robins in die Hände gespielt – man sollte dergleichen unvorsichtige Canaillen auf die Galeere schmieden –, die deine kindische Phantasie erhitzte und dich mit der tollen Sucht zum großen Mann ansteckte? Kitzelt dich nach Namen und Ehre? willst du Unsterblichkeit mit Mordbrennereien erkaufen? Merk dir's, ehrgeiziger Jüngling! Für Mordbrenner grünet kein Lorbeer! Auf Banditensiege ist kein Triumph gesetzt – aber Fluch, Gefahr, Tod, Schande – Siehst du auch das Hochgericht dort auf dem Hügel?
Spiegelberg (unwillig auf und abgehend). Ei wie dumm! wie abscheulich, wie unverzeihlich dumm! Das ist die Manier nicht! ich hab's anders gemacht.
Kosinsky. Was soll Der fürchten, der den Tod nicht fürchtet?
Moor. Brav! unvergleichlich! Du hast dich wacker in den Schulen gehalten, du hast deinen Seneca meisterlich auswendig gelernt. – Aber, lieber Freund, mit dergleichen Sentenzen wirst du die leidende Natur nicht beschwätzen, damit wirst du die Pfeile des Schmerzens nimmermehr stumpf machen. – Besinne dich recht, mein Sohn! (Er nimmt seine Hand.) Denk', ich rathe dir als ein Vater – lern' erst die Tiefe des Abgrunds kennen, eh du hineinspringst! Wenn du noch in der Welt eine einzige Freude zu erhaschen weißt – es könnten Augenblicke kommen, wo du – aufwachst – und dann – möcht' es zu spät sein. Du trittst hier gleichsam aus dem Kreise der Menschheit – entweder mußt du ein höherer Mensch sein, oder du bist ein Teufel – Noch einmal, mein Sohn! Wenn dir noch ein Funken von Hoffnung irgend anderswo glimmt, so verlaß diesen schrecklichen Bund, den nur Verzweiflung eingeht, wenn ihn nicht eine höhere Weisheit gestiftet hat – Man kann sich täuschen – glaube mir, man kann Das für Stärke des Geistes halten, was doch am Ende Verzweiflung ist – Glaube mir, mir! und mach' dich eilig hinweg.
Kosinsky. Nein! ich fliehe jetzt nicht mehr. Wenn dich meine Bitten nicht rühren, so höre die Geschichte meines Unglücks. – Du wirst mir dann selbst den Dolch in die Hände zwingen, du wirst – Lagert euch hier auf dem Boden und hört mir aufmerksam zu!
Moor. Ich will sie hören.
Kosinsky. Wisset also, ich bin ein böhmischer Edelmann und wurde durch den frühen Tod meines Vaters Herr eines ansehnlichen Ritterguts. Die Gegend war paradiesisch – denn sie enthielt einen Engel – ein Mädchen, geschmückt mit allen Reizen der blühenden Jugend und keusch wie das Licht des Himmels. Doch, wem sag' ich das? Es schallt an euren Ohren vorüber – ihr habt niemals geliebt, seid niemals geliebt worden –
Schweizer. Sachte, sachte! unser Hauptmann wird feuerroth.
Moor. Hör' auf! ich will's ein andermal hören – morgen, nächstens, oder – wenn ich Blut gesehen habe.
Kosinsky. Blut, Blut – höre nur weiter! Blut, sag' ich dir, wird deine ganze Seele füllen. Sie war bürgerlicher Geburt, eine Deutsche – aber ihr Anblick schmelzte die Vorurtheile des Adels hinweg. Mit der schüchternsten Bescheidenheit nahm sie den Trauring von meiner Hand, und übermorgen sollte ich meine Amalia vor den Altar führen.
Moor (steht schnell auf).
Kosinsky. Mitten im Taumel der auf mich wartenden Seligkeit, unter den Zurüstungen zur Vermählung – werd' ich durch einen Expressen nach Hof citiert. Ich stellte mich. Man zeigte mir Briefe, die ich geschrieben haben sollte, voll verrätherischen Inhalts. Ich erröthete über der Bosheit – man nahm mir den Degen ab, warf mich ins Gefängnis, alle meine Sinnen waren hinweg.
Schweizer. Und unterdessen – nur weiter! ich rieche den Braten schon.
Kosinsky. Hier lag ich einen Monat lang und wußte nicht, wie mir geschah. Mir bangte für meine Amalia, die meines Schicksals wegen jede Minute würde einen Tod zu leiden haben. Endlich erschien der erste Minister des Hofes, wünschte mir zur Entdeckung meiner Unschuld Glück mit zuckersüßen Worten, liest mir den Brief der Freiheit vor, gibt mir meinen Degen wieder. Jetzt im Triumphe nach meinem Schloß, in die Arme meiner Amalia zu fliegen, – sie war verschwunden. In der Mitternacht sei sie weggebracht worden, wüßte Niemand, wohin? und seitdem mit keinem Aug mehr gesehen. Hui! schoß mir's auf, wie der Blitz, ich flieg' nach der Stadt, sondiere am Hof – alle Augen wurzelten auf mir, Niemand wollte Bescheid geben – endlich entdeck' ich sie durch ein verborgenes Gitter im Palast – sie warf mir ein Billetchen zu.
Schweizer. Hab' ich's nicht gesagt?
Kosinsky. Hölle, Tod und Teufel! da stand's! man hatte ihr die Wahl gelassen, ob sie mich lieber sterben sehen, oder die Maitresse des Fürsten werden wollte. Im Kampf zwischen Ehre und Liebe entschied sie für das Zweite, und (lachend) ich war gerettet.
Schweizer. Was thatst du da?
Kosinsky. Das stand ich, wie von tausend Donnern getroffen! – Blut! war mein erster Gedanke, Blut! mein letzter. Schaum auf dem Munde, renn' ich nach Haus, wähle mir einen dreispitzigen Degen, und damit in aller Jast in des Ministers Haus, denn nur er – er nur war der höllische Kuppler gewesen. Man muß mich von der Gasse bemerkt haben, denn wie ich hinauftrete, waren alle Zimmer verschlossen. Ich suche, ich frage; er sei zum Fürsten gefahren, war die Antwort. Ich mache mich geraden Wegs dahin, man wollte nichts von mir wissen. Ich gehe zurück, sprenge die Thüren ein, finde ihn, wollte eben – aber da sprangen fünf bis sechs Bediente aus dem Hinterhalt und entwanden mir den Degen.
Schweizer (stampft auf den Boden). Und er kriegte nichts, und du zogst leer ab?
Kosinsky. Ich ward ergriffen, angeklagt, peinlich processiert, infam – merkt's euch! – aus besonderer Gnade infam aus den Grenzen gejagt; meine Güter fielen als Präsent dem Minister zu, meine Amalia bleibt in den Klauen des Tigers, verseufzt und vertrauert ihr Leben, während daß meine Rache fasten und sich unter das Joch des Despotismus krümmen muß.
Schweizer (aufstehend, seinen Degen wetzend). Das ist Wasser auf unsere Mühle, Hauptmann! Da gibt's was anzuzünden!
Moor (der bisher in heftigen Bewegungen hin und her gegangen, springt rasch auf, zu den Räubern). Ich muß sie sehen – Auf! rafft zusammen – du bleibst, Kosinsky – packt eilig zusammen!
Die Räuber. Wohin, was?
Moor. Wohin? wer fragt wohin? (Heftig zu Schweizern.) Verräther, du willst mich zurückhalten? Aber bei der Hoffnung des Himmels! –
Schweizer. Verräther ich? – Geh in die Hölle, ich folge dir!
Moor (fällt ihm um den Hals). Bruderherz! du folgst mir – Sie weint, sie vertrauert ihr Leben. Auf! hurtig! Alle! nach Franken! In acht Tagen müssen wir dort sein. (Sie gehen ab.)"

Saʼn ako pupunta?
Sino ba ang tama;
Sino ang may sala
Di ko na maalala, bulag na saʼking luha
Sa piling mo, iyak-tawa
Hirap na may ginhawa
‘Di mo na ʼko marinig
Hawak mo aking leeg
Wasak na wasak, pero baliw pa rin saʼyo
Basag na basag ang puso, pero tibok nitoʼy para saʼyo
‘Di naman ‘to paligsahan
‘Di ako lalaban
Iyak luhod, hingi na lang ng patawad
Wasak na wasak, pero baliw pa rin saʼyo
Basag na basag ang puso, pero tibok nitoʼy para saʼyo
‘Di ko kaya ang lumaban, kung ako na lang ang naiwan"

It can happen to anyone, at any time, for a variety of reasons, and yet when she and her young peers ask for money or assistance on the train or on street corners, people turn their heads and refuse to speak with them.
The TLP drop-in center is run out of the basement of a church on 55th and Indiana; it serves about twenty-five to forty young people each day, most of them regulars. For the most part, it provides them with a hot meal, a place to sleep, access to a computer, and information about services and programs to aid in recovery from homelessness.
The daily routine of many of the regulars, explains Ericka Hill, the drop-in center’s manager, consists of staying together at the center for as long as it is open and then taking the bus down to Ujima Village, the South Side’s only youth overnight shelter, or over to La Casa Norte, Ujima’s West Side equivalent, so they can try to get a bed there. When the shelters close in the morning, Hill says the youth hang out at a nearby McDonald’s until TLP opens for the lunch meal and “coffee hour,” where visitors offer information or trainings, often including bus cards as compensation for participating. At the end of the day, the nightly cycle repeats again.
But TLP is only open four days a week, and only five hours each day. While the shelters are open all week, their beds fill up quickly, and they are often forced to deny many youth admission. These youth are scattered when TLP closes for the weekend, forced to either work together or fend for themselves. On Thursday afternoons, many of them are restless; on Monday mornings, there is a sense of relief, of relaxation.
For homeless youth, no matter how competent or self-motivated, finding other people who understand their situation, both people of their own age and adults who are willing to help them at every stage of their recovery, is invaluable. For those it serves, TLP is more than just a basement where they can get food and rest. For these forty-odd youth, the drop-in center has become nothing less than a safe haven, a place where they know they can find friendship, conversation, and understanding. Some of them have known each other for years, for as long as they have been homeless or longer. Two of them—Daniel and Destiny, a trans woman—have been dating since they met at a North Side shelter, and another two—Angelica and Anton—are married.
“It’s hard to find a place that accepts you,” says Angelica, who is currently on four housing wait lists. “I was pregnant a month ago, and if it wasn’t for La Casa Norte, I wouldn’t have made it. There’s a lot of people who don’t want to help us because they feel like we’re dirty or something. I don’t understand it. Anybody can become homeless, but how they treat us, how they react to us, they don’t understand that. It’s like we’re diseased or something.”
Angelica says TLP has been a huge help to her in applying for housing programs, but that she wishes there were more places like it. Oftentimes she can’t get a bed at La Casa Norte. “We don’t have that many options of people who’ll actually help you,” she says.

Before TLP and La Casa Norte opened their drop-in centers in 2013, homeless youth on the South Side had no such place to get a good meal, meet and befriend teens in similar situations, or just sit down for a while. Even Ujima Village only opened in the last five years. Before that, being homeless on the South or West Sides meant being alone, with nowhere to go, and no one to help you figure out how to get back on your feet. It was like falling through a hole in the world.
Even within the four walls of the drop-in center, the enormity of homelessness is clearly felt. According to numbers available from the Chicago Coalition for the Homeless (CCH), there were over 130,000 homeless people in Chicago during the 2013-2014 school year, a nineteen-percent increase from the previous year. The caseworkers and the teens at TLP are all too aware that making any headway against youth homelessness on the South Side will take not just TLP’s drop-in center but many more like it. Most teens I spoke with said the first step to ending homelessness, even their own homelessness, is to bring more services to the South and West Sides. Until there are more than a few small places for them to go, they say, fighting the root causes of homelessness is practically unthinkable.
✶ ✶ ✶ ✶
“Here’s my bugaboo,” says Jeri Linas. “You can’t treat homeless youth like homeless adults. You’ve got to have a culturally competent response. The reason is purely because of how young brains function. That frontal cortex is not developed until age twenty-five.” Linas is the executive director of TLP, which, in addition to the drop-in center on 55th, also runs a temporary housing program two miles north, at 37th and Indiana.
The unique psychology of young people is a sticking point for Linas, who sees the city as having failed, until recently, to accept homeless youth as a population with specific needs. This deficiency in the “executive branch” of a teen’s brain, she says, prevents many teens from being self-motivated and systems-savvy enough to navigate the labyrinth of paperwork required to extricate oneself from homelessness.
“You can’t always just come to a young person and say, ‘You can’t sit on the street all day, you can’t just smoke weed all day,’” says Linas. “They’re going to go, ‘Why not?’”
Linas deplores what she sees as the previous strategy for dealing with homeless youth, which was to treat the youth, she says, as problems to be fixed.
“Young people are assets,” she says, “and we have to treat them that way. We have to say, ‘Okay, we know you smoke, you drink, you have unprotected sex, because those are coping mechanisms.’ ”
Brandon is a calm, collected, twenty-one-year-old who is one of the most frequent visitors at Teen Living Program’s drop-in center in Washington Park. I ask him what he does when the drop-in center closes. He looks me dead in the eye. “We drown our sorrows in drugs and alcohol,” he says. “Just kidding,” he adds. He pauses. “But not really.”
Whatever the reason—be it trauma, family background, or incomplete education—many homeless teens lack the endurance needed to go through the extensive paperwork and process required to do things like apply for jobs, get crimes expunged from records, and enroll in temporary housing wait lists. The services have to largely be brought to the youth, and not the other way around. Drop-in centers and homeless shelters are meant to do just this with the help of caseworkers and guest speakers.
Despite their youth, many of those at the drop-in center, Brandon included, describe themselves as extremely self-motivated. Almost all of them claim that this year will be their last year being homeless. The difference lies in how they plan to get out: some youth attend all the seminars by guest speakers and spend all day applying for jobs and housing in TLP’s computer lab. Others, says Hill, have far less desire to engage with the city’s bureaucratic networks and paper trails.
“The desire is there,” says Hill, “but there’s so much they have to go through, so much they’re going through already, to get there, that we lose the interest sometimes.”
“It’s just hustling, that’s how you get by,” says Leon, an independent twenty-year-old. “Selling squares  at the liquor store, selling dope, whatever I can get.” I ask him where he sleeps on the weekends, when it is harder to get a bed at Ujima. He says nothing, but then his eyes change. “I’m saving up money, you know,” he says. He pulls a thick roll of bills from his coat pocket. “I’ve been making money with the squares. This is going to be my last year homeless.” I met Leon the first time I visited TLP’s drop-in center, but he was not there on any of my return visits.
Regardless of their motivation or their experiences, says Hill, the most important thing in working with homeless youth—the thing that makes casework with this population so different from casework with adults—is to “meet them where they’re at.” In addition to lacking the education and patience needed to take long-term steps toward recovery, young people ages eighteen to twenty-four are far more likely to feel peer pressure and to feel stigmatized by their homelessness, and they may refuse to seek out services out of shame or embarrassment.
“We do an array of things,” says Hill, “but in some cases, it’s just having a family or a community, having a safe haven, having a place you can go. Sometimes that’s all they want. Some of them have accesses to resources up north, they’ll go and do what they need to do to get what they need, and some don’t have that access, but they come  together.”

When Anne Holcomb was a homeless college student at DePauw in Indiana, over twenty years ago, the North Side neighborhood of Lakeview was known as one of the best places in the country to be homeless. The neighborhood was free of gang activity, unusually accepting of all sexual orientations and gender expressions, and full of services and resources for young homeless people.
“A guy I met in Indiana said, ‘If you ever become homeless again, you might want to think about coming to Chicago. There’s a whole scene there,’ ” said Holcomb. “That was still true when I got here in 1991. There used to be several abandoned cars in front of the Dunkin’ Donuts on Belmont and Clark. One would get towed, another would show up, and you could sleep in them.”
After arriving in Chicago, Holcomb worked with North Side homeless agencies for over a decade before moving to the South Side-focused Unity Parenting and Counseling, where she is now the supervisor of supporting services. Since Holcomb’s arrival, Unity has opened Ujima Village, still the only overnight youth shelter on the South Side. Her office on Cermak is flooded with donation boxes bound for the shelter—everything from cereal to tampons to deodorant to water guns.
“I would say that when I worked in Lakeview , over half of the youth had originated on the South or West Sides,” she says. “I wanted to put my energy into the community where I live.”
Then as now, numerous outreach and support organizations exist in Lakeview for the homeless, including LGBTQ homeless youth. As Elly Fishman reported in a Reader feature in 2012, homelessness in Boystown and Lakeview entails a host of stigmas and dangers, but the fact remains that Lakeview and the North Side remain safer places to be homeless as a youth than the less populated and more impoverished South and West Sides, which Holcomb refers to as a “food desert,” a “retail desert,” and above all a “social service desert.”
Caseworkers like Steve Saunders of Featherfist, a South Shore-based homeless outreach program for adults, say that there are almost certainly more unsheltered homeless from the South and West Sides of the city than the North Side, and that homeless people on the North Side are more able to find each other and work in groups to survive.
According to the city’s Department of Family and Support Services (DFSS), the vast majority (over seventy percent) of the city’s homeless are African-American, most of whom are from the South and West Sides; statistically speaking, the average homeless person is far more likely to come from these areas. If censuses of the homeless conducted in South and West Side neighborhoods return relatively low results, that’s because many homeless people migrate to the North Side, where the streets are safer and the resources more plentiful. The one exception to this rule is Hyde Park, where the recent advent of twenty-four-hour restaurants like Dunkin’ Donuts and Clarke’s on 53rd Street, as well as the lower levels of theft and violent crime, has turned the neighborhood into something of a hub for chronically homeless adults.
This drain toward the North Side is partly due to the plain lack of resources—not only do the South and West Sides have fewer warming centers and casework locations than the North Side, but they are almost completely barren of resources tailored directly to homeless youth.
But it goes deeper than that. Addressing and preventing homelessness involves not just the warming centers, emergency shelters, and transitional housing options that the young people at TLP say are so desperately missing on the South Side, but a whole host of other infrastructures that may at first seem distant or unrelated. These include but are not limited to: employment opportunities, high-quality public education, public transportation, mental health care, safety in open spaces, grocery stores, and available affordable housing.
The South Side has historically lagged behind the North Side in all of these respects, especially since the demolition of the city’s beleaguered housing projects, the shuttering of half a dozen of the city’s mental health clinics and fifty of its public schools, and the recent housing crisis. Generational poverty on the South and West Sides only exacerbates the problem of homelessness and of youth homelessness in particular.
But the problem is far more explicit in the “youth homelessness” subset. Until the advent of La Casa Norte, Ujima Village, and Teen Living Programs, all of which were founded in the last ten years, there had been an almost total lack of youth-oriented services on the South and West Sides.
✶ ✶ ✶ ✶
In 2013 the Mayor’s Task Force to End Homelessness, an institution that survived from the last days of the Daley administration, released its so-called “Plan 2.0 to End Homelessness,” a ten-year strategy for addressing the biggest problems with homeless services in Chicago. One of the plan’s main items was a provision about the importance of aiding homeless youth ages eighteen to twenty-four, which was the first time youth homelessness was recognized by the city as a significant issue in its own right.
Among other things, Plan 2.0 called for the creation of a smaller task force, the City of Chicago Task Force on Homeless Youth (hereafter referred to as the Task Force), which then sought to address major areas of oversight and inequity in how the city provides services to this age group.
Since it was first convened, this Task Force has successfully addressed and implemented two of its major goals. The first was an initiative to obtain accurate data about the youth homeless population in Chicago. The second was a promise to fund one new drop-in center on the North, South, and West Sides—Broadway Youth Center, La Casa Norte, and Teen Living Programs respectively. But while the new drop-in center on the North Side was not the first of its kind in that area, TLP’s drop-in center on 55th and Indiana was. It is the first daytime youth shelter to exist on the South Side ever. La Casa Norte’s drop-in centers in Lawndale and Back of the Yards set similar precedents on the West and Southwest Sides.
The Task Force recently met, on January 15, to review what progress had been made in the first two years of the plan. The meeting, at the Department of Family and Support Services on Chicago and Ashland, featured city officials from DFSS and CPS as well as three or four advocates from CCH. Also present in full force were youth service providers from across the city. Holcomb, Flores, and Linas were there, along with three or four emissaries from various North Side service providers.
The meeting’s agenda was fairly thin: review goals, identify areas of achievement and failure, and discuss possibilities. The first half proceeded with relative ease as the Task Force reviewed what progress it had made in designing a youth-specific method for counting the homeless, opening up one new drop-in center on each side of the city, and making connections with and offering training to CPS officials who work with homeless students or those with unstable housing.
But as the “areas of failure” portion led into the open discussion, the room became noticeably more tense: some of the failures identified by the slideshow tie in with systematic issues like public transportation (the Task Force has been unable to negotiate successfully with the CTA for the subsidization of bus passes), and mental health (it’s harder than ever to find nearby clinics, let alone hire workers to come diagnose youth with mental health issues). Grappling with these issues out loud led to the creation of subcommittees and further meetings, and to a room-wide biting of lips and more than a few raised voices.
The general sense is that discussions and committees can only do so much—but there the sentence breaks off. Without huge changes in the city’s politics and infrastructure, the role that individual advocates at DFSS, CCH, or service providers can play in aiding the city’s youth homeless population, even on the North Side, is limited.
“You’re homeless, you feel me?” says James (“Bond” to his friends), a talkative nineteen-year-old at TLP’s drop-in center. “Why are you homeless? Probably because your family kicked you out. Why did your family kick you out? Because ain’t everybody eating. Why ain’t everybody eating? Everybody can’t get a job. And now you’re homeless, and maybe you got a kid, and you don’t have a place to stay, and now you can’t get a job, you feel me? Your family can’t get a job, now you can’t get a job.”
✶ ✶ ✶ ✶
To further complicate matters, there is a significant lack of thorough and reliable data on the homeless population in Chicago. Yearly tallies of the city’s sheltered population and an annual volunteer-led count of the unsheltered homeless found on Chicago’s city streets in the winter attempt to offer a “snapshot” of the city’s homeless population, but experts from the DFSS and from homeless outreach organizations agree that this snapshot is nowhere close to complete.
The results of the most recent homeless count by the DFSS finds youth ages eighteen to twenty-four to be one of the smallest segments of the homeless population, but there is no telling how indicative the results of this count are. Since homelessness is particularly stigmatized among youth, and since this population is less likely to want to be counted, the data on youth homelessness is probably the least trustworthy. An independent census conducted in 2005 by the University of Illinois at Chicago estimated that there are two thousand homeless youths in Chicago on any given night; this number, says Linas, is the best figure available to service providers.
Though the point-in-time count of unsheltered homeless people has been employed in Chicago for well over a decade, this year marks only the second time that the Task Force on Homeless Youth has conducted a youth-specific homeless count. The conductors of this year’s count, spearheaded by Adriana Camarda of DFSS, were not adult volunteers but homeless youth whom the city paid to seek out their peers. The idea, Camarda says, is that they might know where to find those who refuse to make themselves visible to DFSS and its partners.
“There’s been a gap in services on the South Side, historically,” says Camarda, “and now we’re using this data to spread these services geographically to the areas that don’t have them. As we get more data, we’ll be able to expand more.” Having the data, Camarda says, has brought more awareness to homeless youth as a population with specific needs and characteristics.
Last year’s count, conducted by service providers on the youth in their facilities, surveyed four hundred homeless young people ages eighteen to twenty-four. Preliminary findings from this study indicated that over half of the respondents had not completed high school and that over a quarter of them had no source of income. The report ends, however, with a caveat: “the survey findings do not provide a conclusive number of homeless or unstably housed youth in Chicago,” due both to resource limitations and to the unique challenges of finding and counting homeless people of this age group. Results from this year’s youth-to-youth count are not available at press time (2014’s results came out in July), but Camarda’s belief—and her hope—is that increasingly accurate data on the youth homeless population will make it easier, and possible, to provide services. Until then, the work of service providers and city policymakers amounts to something like the fable about blind men touching different parts of an elephant and trying to describe what the creature looks like.
“One of the things we knew we would learn when we opened the drop-in center was what we didn’t know,” says Linas. “Within a year of opening, we’d served five hundred youths we’d never seen before. We need more research, we need more numbers. How do you know that what you’re doing is making a difference, not just now or in the next two years, but in five years, or in ten years?” Linas says that over a hundred shelter beds have been added across the city since the release of Plan 2.0 in 2013, but it’s impossible to know just how much of a dent has been put in the overall population.
But even with the numbers available in the UIC census, it is clear to activists and city officials alike that the problem is daunting. Homelessness is extremely complex on a systemic and infrastructural level, but it is also complex on an individual level—for a single person to get out of homelessness can take months of dedicated casework, not to mention psychological therapy. In order to apply for the housing wait list, for example, you need a valid state ID. You can get that ID for free from the city if you are homeless, but first you need to fill out the city’s form, which you need a computer to download and print out. Then you need to get signatures from both a notary and a service provider, who will both testify that you are homeless. Only then can you mail or deliver the form to the Thompson Center downtown to get your ID.
Even for the strong-minded, this process could take weeks to complete, but a huge portion of the homeless youth that visit drop-in centers and overnight shelters need adult help not just in navigating governmental processes but in dealing with the trauma inherent in being homeless.
“One of our biggest needs is trying to find a therapist or a psychologist that can assess, diagnose, medicate, come to our shelter—even just once a week,” says Holcomb. “If you don’t have a diagnosis, where can you go for mental health care? You’re eighteen, you’ve been kicked out of your house, you saw someone shot a few days ago, and now someone’s handing you a paper referral saying go apply for housing? We need someone there  can stay the course.”

For these forty-odd youth, the drop-in center has become nothing less than a safe haven, a place where they know they can find friendship, conversation, and understanding.
For these forty-odd youth, the drop-in center has become nothing less than a safe haven, a place where they know they can find friendship, conversation, and understanding.
It is the job of the drop-in centers and the shelters, where caseworkers like Hill work with teens face-to-face, to stay this course. A single church basement may not be able to end homelessness, or even to end one young person’s homelessness, but what it can do, even if only for a few hours, is offer young people a place to stay, a place to be.
Nowhere is this clearer than in the just-installed “recording studio” in the back office of TLP’s drop-in center, where youth can sign up to write and record raps with a peer educator who visits the center a few days a week. Almost everyone uses the studio whenever it’s available, including Hill, who performs a beautiful Gladys Knight cover for me to test out the equipment. On the second day I visit, five or six boys of varying ages sit together in the tiny room (the “booth” is made of plywood and sound-resistant curtain) trading lines back and forth for a new song they’re working on. After twenty minutes of debate and discussion, they settle on the chorus, to be sung by their layered voices in between rap verses: “This a demonstration / Lotta people been anticipatin’ / Life shouldn’t be so hard / Day shouldn’t feel so long.”
Though they don’t put homeless youth any closer to having a place to stay, artistic expression and other forms of “alternative therapy” are widely regarded by service providers as an essential part of helping with recovery. At press time, Holcomb has just hired an artist who will help her run what she calls a “speak-truth-to-power arts group” out of Ujima every week. Holcomb says she hopes the group will help youth understand not only that their situation does not have to last forever, but also that they do not have to feel broken or cast out.
Even as the endlessness of the issue looms large over the head of individual service providers like Linas, Holcomb, and Hill, they have to stay focused and remember what they can do: help the youth they meet out of the hole into which they have fallen, one by one.
“You look at the population and say, ‘We have to go further upstream to deal with this issue.’ That entails family conflict, poverty, lack of affordable housing, so many things,” says Linas. “The challenge  then becomes, what do those young people walking off the street need? How can we make them safe, and how can we make them stable?”"

It may half been a missfired brick, as some say, or it mought have been due to a collupsus of his back promises, as others looked at it.

Shize? I should shee! Macool, Macool, orra whyi deed ye diie? of a trying thirstay mournin? Sobs they sighdid at Fillagain’s chrissormiss wake, all the hoolivans of the nation, prostrated in their consternation and their duodisimally profusive plethora of ululation. There was plumbs and grumes and cheriffs and citherers and raiders and cinemen too. And the all gianed in with the shoutmost shoviality. Agog and magog and the round of them agrog. To the continuation of that celebration until Hanandhunigan’s extermination! Some in kinkin corass, more, kankan keening. Belling him up and filling him down. He’s stiff but he’s steady is Priam Olim! ’Twas he was the dacent gaylabouring youth. Sharpen his pillowscone, tap up his bier! E’erawhere in this whorl would ye hear sich a din again?

Well, Him a being so on the flounder of his bulk like an overgrown babeling, let wee peep, see, at Hom, well, see peegee ought he ought, platterplate. Hum! From Shopalist to Bailywick or from ashtun to baronoath or from Buythebanks to Roundthehead or from the foot of the bill to ireglint’s eye he calmly extensolies.

For what we are, gifs a gross if we are, about to believe. So pool the begg and pass the kish for crawsake. Omen. So sigh us. Grampupus is fallen down but grinny sprids the boord. Whase on the joint of a desh? Finfoefom the Fush. Whase be his baken head? A loaf of Singpantry’s Kennedy bread. And whase hitched to the hop in his tayle? A glass of Danu U’Dunnell’s foamous olde Dobbelin ayle. But, lo, as you would quaffoff his fraudstuff and sink teeth through that pyth of a flowerwhite bodey behold of him as behemoth for he is noewhemoe. Finiche! Only a fadograph of a yestern scene. Almost rubicund Salmosalar, ancient fromout the ages of the Agapemonides, he is smolten in our mist, woebecanned and packt away. So that meal’s dead off for summan, schlook, schlice and goodridhirring.

Phew!
What a warm time we were in there but how keling is here the airabouts! We nowhere she lives but you mussna tell annaone for the lamp of Jig-a-Lanthern! It’s a candlelittle houthse of a month and one windies. Downadown, High Downadown. And nummered quaintlymine. And such reasonable weather too! The wagrant wind’s awalt’zaround the piltdowns and on every blasted knollyrock (if you can spot fifty I spy four more) there’s that gnarlybird ygathering, a runalittle, doalittle, preealittle, pouralittle, wipealittle, kicksalittle, severalittle, eatalittle, whinealittle, kenalittle, helfalittle, pelfalittle gnarlybird. A verytableland of bleakbardfields! Under his seven wrothschields lies one, Lumproar. His glav toside him. Skud ontorsed. Our pigeons pair are flewn for northcliffs. The three of crows have flapped it southenly, kraaking of de baccle to the kvarters of that sky whence triboos answer; Wail, ’tis well! She niver comes out when Thon’s on shower or when Thon’s flash with his Nixy girls or when Thon’s blowing toomcracks down the gaels of Thon. No nubo no! Neblas on you liv! Her would be too moochy afreet. Of Burymeleg and Bindmerollingeyes and all the deed in the woe. Fe fo fom! She jist does hopes till byes will be byes. Here, and it goes on to appear now, she comes, a peacefugle, a parody’s bird, a peri potmother, a pringlpik in the ilandiskippy, with peewee and powwows in beggybaggy on her bickybacky and a flick flask fleckflinging its pixylighting pacts’ huemeramybows, picking here, pecking there, pussypussy plunderpussy. But it’s the armitides toonigh, militopucos, and toomourn we wish for a muddy kissmans to the minutia workers and there’s to be a gorgeups truce for happinest childher everwere. Come nebo me and suso sing the day we sallybright. She’s burrowed the coacher’s headlight the better to pry (who goes cute goes siocur and shoos aroun) and all spoiled goods go into her nabsack: curtrages and rattlin buttins, nappy spattees and flasks of all nations, clavicures and scampulars, maps, keys and woodpiles of haypennies and moonled brooches with bloodstaned breeks in em, boaston nightgarters and masses of shoesets and nickelly nacks and foder allmicheal and a lugly parson of cates and howitzer muchears and midgers and maggets, ills and ells with loffs of toffs and pleures of bells and the last sigh that come fro the hart (bucklied!) and the fairest sin the sunsaw (that’s cearc!). With Kiss. Kiss Criss. Cross Criss. Kiss Cross. Undo lives ‘end. Slain.
How bootifull and how truetowife of her, when strengly forebidden, to steal our historic presents from the past postpropheticals so as to will make us all lordy heirs and ladymaidesses of a pretty nice kettle of fruit. She is livving in our midst of debt and laffing through all plores for us (her birth is uncontrollable), with a naperon for her mask and her sabboes kickin arias (so sair! so solly!) if yous ask me and I saack you. Hou! Hou! Gricks may rise and Troysirs fall (there being two sights for ever a picture) for in the byways of high improvidence that’s what makes lifework leaving and the world’s a cell for citters to cit in. Let young wimman run away with the story and let young min talk smooth behind the butteler’s back. She knows her knight’s duty while Luntum sleeps. Did ye save any tin? says he. Did I what? with a grin says she. And we all like a marriedann because she is mercenary. Though the length of the land lies under liquidation (floote!) and there’s nare a hairbrow nor an eyebush on this glaubrous phace of Herrschuft Whatarwelter she’ll loan a vesta and hire some peat and sarch the shores her cockles to heat and she’ll do all a turfwoman can to piff the business on. Paff. To puff the blaziness on. Poffpoff. And even if Humpty shell fall frumpty times as awkward again in the beardsboosoloom of all our grand remonstrancers there’ll be iggs for the brekkers come to mournhim, sunny side up with care. So true is it that therewhere’s a turnover the tay is wet too and when you think you ketch sight of a hind make sure but you’re cocked by a hin.
Then as she is on her behaviourite job of quainance bandy, fruting for firstlings and taking her tithe, we may take our review of the two mounds to see nothing of the himples here as at elsewhere, by sixes and sevens, like so many heegills and collines, sitton aroont, scentbreeched ant somepotreek, in their swishawish satins and their taffetaffe tights, playing Wharton’s Folly, at a treepurty on the planko in the purk. Stand up, mickos! Make strake for minnas! By order, Nicholas Proud. We may see and hear nothing if we choose of the shortlegged bergins off Corkhill or the bergamoors of Arbourhill or the bergagambols of Summerhill or the bergincellies of Miseryhill or the countrybossed bergones of Constitutionhill though every crowd has its several tones and every trade has its clever mechanics and each harmonical has a point of its own, Olaf’s on the rise and Ivor’s on the lift and Sitric’s place’s between them. But all they are all there scraping along to sneeze out a likelihood that will solve and salve life’s robulous rebus, hopping round his middle like kippers on a griddle, O, as he lays dormont from the macroborg of Holdhard to the microbirg of Pied de Poudre. Behove this sound of Irish sense. Really? Here English might be seen. Royally? One sovereign punned to petery pence. Regally? The silence speaks the scene. Fake!
So This Is Dyoublong?
Hush! Caution! Echoland!
How charmingly exquisite! It reminds you of the outwashed engravure that we used to be blurring on the blotchwall of his innkempt house. Used they? (I am sure that tiring chabelshoveller with the mujikal chocolat box, Miry Mitchel, is listening) I say, the remains of the outworn gravemure where used to be blurried the Ptollmens of the Incabus. Used we? (He is only pretendant to be stugging at the jubalee harp from a second existed lishener, Fiery Farrelly.) It is well known. Lokk for himself and see the old butte new. Dbln. W. K. O. O. Hear? By the mausolime wall. Fimfim fimfim. With a grand funferall. Fumfum fumfum. ’Tis optophone which ontophanes. List! Wheatstone’s magic lyer. They will be tuggling foriver. They will be lichening for allof. They will be pretumbling forover. The harpsdischord shall be theirs for ollaves.
Four things therefore, saith our herodotary Mammon Lujius in his grand old historiorum, wrote near Boriorum, bluest book in baile’s annals, f t. in Dyffinarsky ne’er sall fail til heathersmoke and cloudweed Eire’s ile sall pall. And here now they are, the fear of um. T. Totities! Unum. (Adar.) A bulbenboss surmounted upon an alderman. Ay, ay! Duum. (Nizam.) A shoe on a puir old wobban. Ah, ho! Triom. (Tamuz.) An auburn mayde, o’brine a’bride, to be desarted. Adear, adear! Quodlibus. (Marchessvan.) A penn no weightier nor a polepost. And so. And all. (Succoth.)
So, how idlers’ wind turning pages on pages, as innocens with anaclete play popeye antipop, the leaves of the living in the boke of the deeds, annals of themselves timing the cycles of events grand and national, bring fassilwise to pass how.
1132 A.D. Men like to ants or emmets wondern upon a groot hwide Whallfisk which lay in a Runnel. Blubby wares upat Ublanium.

On Baalfire’s night of this year after deluge a crone that hadde a wickered Kish for to hale dead tunes from the bog lookit under the blay of her Kish as she ran for to sothisfeige her cowrieosity and be me sawl but she found hersell sackvulle of swart goody quickenshoon ant small illigant brogues, so rich in sweat.

566 A.D. At this time it fell out that a brazenlockt damsel grieved (sobralasolas!) because that Puppette her minion was ravisht of her by the ogre Puropeus Pious. Bloody wars in Ballyaughacleeaghbally.
1132. A.D. Two sons at an hour were born until a goodman and his hag. These sons called themselves Caddy and Primas. Primas was a santryman and drilled all decent people. Caddy went to Winehouse and wrote o peace a farce. Blotty words for Dublin.
Somewhere, parently, in the ginnandgo gap between antediluvious and annadominant the copyist must have fled with his scroll. The billy flood rose or an elk charged him or the sultrup worldwright from the excelsissimost empyrean (bolt, in sum) earthspake or the Dannamen gallous banged pan the bliddy duran. A scribicide then and there is led off under old’s code with some fine covered by six marks or ninepins in metalmen for the sake of his labour’s dross while it will be only now and again in our rear of o’er era, as an upshoot of military and civil engagements, that a gynecure was let on to the scuffold for taking that same fine sum covertly by meddlement with the drawers of his neighbour’s safe.
Now after all that farfatch’d and peragrine or dingnant or clere lift we our ears, eyes of the darkness, from the tome of Liber Lividus and, (toh!), how paisibly eirenical, all dimmering dunes and gloamering glades, selfstretches afore us our fredeland’s plain! Lean neath stone pine the pastor lies with his crook; young pricket by pricket’s sister nibbleth on returned viridities; amaid her rocking grasses the herb trinity shams lowliness; skyup is of evergrey. Thus, too, for donkey’s years. Since the bouts of Hebear and Hairyman the cornflowers have been staying at Ballymun, the duskrose has choosed out Goatstown’s hedges, twolips have pressed togatherthem by sweet Rush, townland of twinedlights, the whitethorn and the redthorn have fairygeyed the mayvalleys of Knockmaroon, and, though for rings round them, during a chiliad of perihelygangs, the Formoreans have brittled the tooath of the Danes and the Oxman has been pestered by the Firebugs and the Joynts have thrown up jerrybuilding to the Kevanses and Little on the Green is childsfather to the City (Year! Year! And laughtears!), these paxsealing buttonholes have quadrilled across the centuries and whiff now whafft to us, fresh and made-of-all-smiles as, on the eve of Killallwho.
The babbelers with their thangas vain have been (confusium hold them!) they were and went; thigging thugs were and houhnhymn songtoms were and comely norgels were and pollyfool fiansees. Menn have thawed, clerks have surssurhummed, the blond has sought of the brune: Elsekiss thou may, mean Kerry piggy?: and the duncledames have countered with the hellish fellows: Who ails tongue coddeau, aspace of dumbillsilly? And they fell upong one another: and themselves they have fallen. And still nowanights and by nights of yore do all bold floras of the field to their shyfaun lovers say only: Cull me ere I wilt to thee!: and, but a little later: Pluck me whilst I blush! Well may they wilt, marry, and profusedly blush, be troth! For that saying is as old as the howitts. Lave a whale a while in a whillbarrow (isn’t it the truath I’m tallin ye?) to have fins and flippers that shimmy and shake. Tim Timmycan timped hir, tampting Tam. Fleppety! Flippety! Fleapow!
Hop!

Many. Miscegenations on miscegenations. Tieckle. They lived und laughed ant loved end left. Forsin. Thy thingdome is given to the Meades and Porsons. The meandertale, aloss and again, of our old Heidenburgh in the days when HeadinClouds walked the earth. In the ignorance that implies impression that knits knowledge that finds the nameform that whets the wits that convey contacts that sweeten sensation that drives desire that adheres to attachment that dogs death that bitches birth that entails the ensuance of existentiality. But with a rush out of his navel reaching the reredos of Ramasbatham. A terricolous vivelyonview this; queer and it continues to be quaky.

It was of a night, late, lang time agone, in an auldstane eld, when Adam was delvin and his madameen spinning watersilts, when mulk mountynotty man was everybully and the first leal ribberrobber that ever had her ainway everybuddy to his lovesaking eyes and everybilly lived alove with everybiddy else, and Jarl van Hoother had his burnt head high up in his lamphouse, laying cold hands on himself. And his two little jiminies, cousins of ourn, Tristopher and Hilary, were kickaheeling their dummy on the oil cloth flure of his homerigh, castle and earthenhouse. And, be dermot, who come to the keep of his inn only the niece-of-his-inlaw, the prankquean. And the prankquean pulled a rosy one and made her wit foreninst the dour. And she lit up and fireland was ablaze. And spoke she to the dour in her petty perusienne: Mark the Wans, why do I am alook alike a poss of porterpease? And that was how the skirtmisshes began. But the dour handworded her grace in dootch nossow: Shut! So her grace o’malice kidsnapped up the jiminy Tristopher and into the shandy westerness she rain, rain, rain. And Jarl van Hoother warlessed after her with soft dovesgall: Stop deef stop come back to my earin stop. But she swaradid to him: Unlikelihud. And there was a brannewail that same sabboath night of falling angles somewhere in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty years’ walk in Tourlemonde and she washed the blessings of the lovespots off the jiminy with soap sulliver suddles and she had her four owlers masters for to tauch him his tickles and she convorted him to the onesure allgood and he became a luderman. So then she started to rain and to rain and, be redtom, she was back again at Jarl van Hoother’s in a brace of samers and the jiminy with her in her pinafrond, lace at night, at another time. And where did she come but to the bar of his bristolry. And Jarl von Hoother had his baretholobruised heels drowned in his cellarmalt, shaking warm hands with himself and the jimminy Hilary and the dummy in their first infancy were below on the tearsheet, wringing and coughing, like brodar and histher. And the prankquean nipped a paly one and lit up again and redcocks flew flackering from the hillcombs. And she made her witter before the wicked, saying: Mark the Twy, why do I am alook alike two poss of porterpease? And: Shut! says the wicked, handwording her madesty. So her madesty ‘a forethought’ set down a jiminy and took up a jiminy and all the lilipath ways to Woeman’s Land she rain, rain, rain. And Jarl von Hoother bleethered atter her with a loud finegale: Stop domb stop come back with my earring stop. But the prankquean swaradid: Am liking it. And there was a wild old grannewwail that laurency night of starshootings somewhere in Erio. And the prankquean went for her forty years’ walk in Turnlemeem and she punched the curses of cromcruwell with the nail of a top into the jiminy and she had her four larksical monitrix to touch him his tears and she provorted him to the onecertain allsecure and he became a tristian. So then she started raining, raining, and in a pair of changers, be dom ter, she was back again at Jarl von Hoother’s and the Larryhill with her under her abromette. And why would she halt at all if not by the ward of his mansionhome of another nice lace for the third charm? And Jarl von Hoother had his hurricane hips up to his pantrybox, ruminating in his holdfour stomachs (Dare! O dare!), ant the jiminy Toughertrees and the dummy were belove on the watercloth, kissing and spitting, and roguing and poghuing, like knavepaltry and naivebride and in their second infancy. And the prankquean picked a blank and lit out and the valleys lay twinkling. And she made her wittest in front of the arkway of trihump, asking: Mark the Tris, why do I am alook alike three poss of porter pease? But that was how the skirtmishes endupped. For like the campbells acoming with a fork lance of lightning, Jarl von Hoother Boanerges himself, the old terror of the dames, came hip hop handihap out through the pikeopened arkway of his three shuttoned castles, in his broadginger hat and his civic chollar and his allabuff hemmed and his bullbraggin soxangloves and his ladbroke breeks and his cattegut bandolair and his furframed panuncular cumbottes like a rudd yellan gruebleen orangeman in his violet indigonation, to the whole longth of the strongth of his bowman’s bill. And he clopped his rude hand to his eacy hitch and he ordurd and his thick spch spck for her to shut up shop, dappy. And the duppy shot the shutter clup (Perkodhuskurunbarggruauyagokgorlayorgromgremmitghundhurthrumathunaradidillifaititillibumullunukkunun!) And they all drank free. For one man in his armour was a fat match always for any girls under shurts. And that was the first peace of illiterative porthery in all the flamend floody flatuous world. How kirssy the tiler made a sweet unclose to the Narwhealian captol. Saw fore shalt thou sea. Betoun ye and be. The prankquean was to hold her dummyship and the jimminies was to keep the peacewave and van Hoother was to git the wind up. Thus the hearsomeness of the burger felicitates the whole of the polis.
O foenix culprit! Ex nickylow malo comes mickelmassed bonum. Hill, rill, ones in company, billeted, less be proud of. Breast high and bestride!

Now be aisy, good Mr Finnimore, sir. And take your laysure like a god on pension and don’t be walking abroad. Sure you’d only lose yourself in Healiopolis now the way your roads in Kapelavaster are that winding there after the calvary, the North Umbrian and the Fivs Barrow and Waddlings Raid and the Bower Moore and wet your feet maybe with the foggy dew’s abroad. Meeting some sick old bankrupt or the Cottericks’ donkey with his shoe hanging, clankatachankata, or a slut snoring with an impure infant on a bench. ‘Twould turn you against life, so ‘twould. And the weather’s that mean too. To part from Devlin is hard as Nugent knew, to leave the clean tanglesome one lushier than its neighbour enfranchisable fields but let your ghost have no grievance. You’re better off, sir, where you are, primesigned in the full of your dress, bloodeagle waistcoat and all, remembering your shapes and sizes on the pillow of your babycurls under your sycamore by the keld water where the Tory’s clay will scare the varmints and have all you want, pouch, gloves, flask, bricket, kerchief, ring and amberulla, the whole treasure of the pyre, in the land of souls with Homin and Broin Baroke and pole ole Lonan and Nobucketnozzler and the Guinnghis Khan. And we’ll be coming here, the ombre players, to rake your gravel and bringing you presents, won’t we, fenians? And il isn’t our spittle we’ll stint you of, is it, druids? Not shabbty little imagettes, pennydirts and dodgemyeyes you buy in the soottee stores. But offerings of the field.
Mieliodories, that Doctor Faherty, the madison man, taught to gooden you. Poppypap’s a passport out. And honey is the holiest thing ever was, hive, comb and earwax, the food for glory, (mind you keep the pot or your nectar cup may yield too light!) and some goat’s milk, sir, like the maid used to bring you. Your fame is spreading like Basilico’s ointment since the Fintan Lalors piped you overborder and there’s whole households beyond the Bothnians and they calling names after you. The menhere’s always talking of you sitting around on the pig’s cheeks under the sacred rooftree, over the bowls of memory where every hollow holds a hallow, with a pledge till the drengs, in the Salmon House. And admiring to our supershillelagh where the palmsweat on high is the mark of your manument. All the toethpicks ever Eirenesians chewed on are chips chepped from that battery block. If you were bowed and soild and letdown itself from the oner of the load it was that paddyplanters might pack up plenty and when you were undone in every point fore the laps of goddesses you showed our labourlasses how to free was easy. The game old Gunne, they do be saying, (skull!) that was a planter for you, a spicer of them all. Begog but he was, the G.O.G! He’s duddandgunne now and we’re apter finding the sores of his sedeq but peace to his great limbs, the buddhoch, with the last league long rest of him, while the millioncandled eye of Tuskar sweeps the Moylean Main! There was never a warlord in Great Erinnes and Brettland, no, nor in all Pike County like you, they say. No, nor a king nor an ardking, bung king, sung king or hung king. That you could fell an elmstree twelve urchins couldn’t ring round and hoist high the stone that Liam failed. Who but a Maccullaghmore the reise of our fortunes and the faunayman at the funeral to compass our cause? If you was hogglebully itself and most frifty like you was taken waters still what all where was your like to lay the cable or who was the batter could better Your Grace? Mick Mac Magnus MacCawley can take you off to the pure perfection and Leatherbags Reynolds tries your shuffle and cut. But as Hopkins and Hopkins puts it, you were the pale eggynaggy and a kis to tilly up. We calls him the journeyall Buggaloffs since he went Jerusalemfaring in Arssia Manor. You had a gamier cock than Pete, Jake or Martin and your archgoose of geese stubbled for All Angels’ Day. So may the priest of seven worms and scalding tayboil, Papa Vestray, come never anear you as your hair grows wheater beside the Liffey that’s in Heaven! Hep, hep, hurrah there! Hero! Seven times thereto we salute you! The whole bag of kits, falconplumes and jackboots incloted, is where you flung them that time. Your heart is in the system of the Shewolf and your crested head is in the tropic of Copricapron. Your feet are in the cloister of Virgo. Your olala is in the region of sahuls. And that’s ashore as you were born. Your shuck tick’s swell. And that there texas is tow linen. The loamsome roam to Laffayette is ended. Drop in your tracks, babe! Be not unrested! The headboddylwatcher of the chempel of Isid, Totumcalmum, saith: I know thee, metherjar, I know thee, salvation boat. For we have performed upon thee, thou abramanation, who comest ever without being invoked, whose coming is unknown, all the things which the company of the precentors and of the grammarians of Christpatrick’s ordered concerning thee in the matter of the work of thy tombing. Howe of the shipmen, steep wall!
Everything’s going on the same or so it appeals to all of us, in the old holmsted here. Coughings all over the sanctuary, bad scrant to me aunt Florenza. The horn for breakfast, one o’gong for lunch and dinnerchime. As popular as when Belly the First was keng and his members met in the Diet of Man. The same shop slop in the window. Jacob’s lettercrackers and Dr Tipple’s Vi–Cocoa and the Eswuards’ desippated soup beside Mother Seagull’s syrup. Meat took a drop when Reilly–Parsons failed. Coal’s short but we’ve plenty of bog in the yard. And barley’s up again, begrained to it. The lads is attending school nessans regular, sir, spelling beesknees with hathatansy and turning out tables by mudapplication. Allfor the books and never pegging smashers after Tom Bowe Glassarse or Timmy the Tosser. ‘Tisraely the truth! No isn’t it, roman pathoricks? You were the doublejoynted janitor the morning they were delivered and you’ll be a grandfer yet entirely when the ritehand seizes what the lovearm knows. Kevin’s just a doat with his cherub cheek, chalking oghres on walls, and his little lamp and schoolbelt and bag of knicks, playing postman’s knock round the diggings and if the seep were milk you could lieve his olde by his ide but, laus sake, the devil does be in that knirps of a Jerry sometimes, the tarandtan plaidboy, making encostive inkum out of the last of his lavings and writing a blue streak over his bourseday shirt. Hetty Jane’s a child of Mary. She’ll be coming (for they’re sure to choose her) in her white of gold with a tourch of ivy to rekindle the flame on Felix Day. But Essie Shanahan has let down her skirts. You remember Essie in our Luna’s Convent? They called her Holly Merry her lips were so ruddyberry and Pia de Purebelle when the redminers riots was on about her. Were I a clerk designate to the Williamswoodsmenufactors I’d poster those pouters on every jamb in the town. She’s making her rep at Lanner’s twicenightly. With the tabarine tamtammers of the whirligigmagees. Beats that cachucha flat. ‘Twould dilate your heart to go.
Aisy now, you decent man, with your knees and lie quiet and repose your honour’s lordship! Hold him here, Ezekiel Irons, and may God strengthen you! It’s our warm spirits, boys, he’s spooring. Dimitrius O’Flagonan, cork that cure for the Clancartys! You swamped enough since Portobello to float the Pomeroy. Fetch neahere, Pat Koy! And fetch nouyou, Pam Yates! Be nayther angst of Wramawitch! Here’s lumbos. Where misties swaddlum, where misches lodge none, where mystries pour kind on, O sleepy! So be yet!
I’ve an eye on queer Behan and old Kate and the butter, trust me. She’ll do no jugglywuggly with her war souvenir postcards to help to build me murial, tippers! I’ll trip your traps! Assure a sure there! And we put on your clock again, sir, for you. Did or didn’t we, sharestutterers? So you won’t be up a stump entirely. Nor shed your remnants. The sternwheel’s crawling strong. I seen your missus in the hall. Like the queenoveire. Arrah, it’s herself that’s fine, too, don’t be talking! Shirksends? You storyan Harry chap longa me Harry chap storyan grass woman plelthy good trout. Shakeshands. Dibble a hayfork’s wrong with her only her lex’s salig. Boald Tib does be yawning and smirking cat’s hours on the Pollockses’ woolly round tabouretcushion watching her sewing a dream together, the tailor’s daughter, stitch to her last. Or while waiting for winter to fire the enchantement, decoying more nesters to fall down the flue. It’s allavalonche that blows nopussy food. If you only were there to explain the meaning, best of men, and talk to her nice of guldenselver. The lips would moisten once again. As when you drove with her to Findrinny Fair. What with reins here and ribbons there all your hands were employed so she never knew was she on land or at sea or swooped through the blue like Airwinger’s bride. She was flirtsome then and she’s fluttersome yet. She can second a song and adores a scandal when the last post’s gone by. Fond of a concertina and pairs passing when she’s had her forty winks for supper after kanekannan and abbely dimpling and is in her merlin chair assotted, reading her Evening World. To see is it smarts, full lengths or swaggers. News, news, all the news. Death, a leopard, kills fellah in Fez. Angry scenes at Stormount. Stilla Star with her lucky in goingaways.
Opportunity fair with the China floods and we hear these rosy rumours. Ding Tams he noise about all same Harry chap. She’s seeking her way, a chickle a chuckle, in and out of their serial story, Les Loves of Selskar et Pervenche, freely adapted to The Novvergin’s Viv. There’ll be bluebells blowing in salty sepulchres the night she signs her final tear. Zee End. But that’s a world of ways away. Till track laws time. No silver ash or switches for that one! While flattering candles flare. Anna Stacey’s how are you! Worther waist in the noblest, says Adams and Sons, the wouldpay actionneers. Her hair’s as brown as ever it was. And wivvy and wavy. Repose you now! Finn no more!
For, be that samesake sibsubstitute of a hooky salmon, there’s already a big rody ram lad at random on the premises of his haunt of the hungred bordles, as it is told me. Shop Illicit, flourishing like a lordmajor or a buaboabaybohm, litting flop a deadlop (aloose!) to lee but lifting a bennbranch a yardalong (Ivoeh!) the breezy side (for showm!), the height of Brewster’s chimpney and as broad below as Phineas Barnum; humphing his share of the showthers is senken on him he’s such a grandfallar, with a pocked wife in pickle that’s a flyfire and three lice nittle clinkers, two twilling bugs and one midgit pucelle. And aither he cursed and recursed and was everseen doing what your fourfootlers saw or he was never done seeing what you coolpigeons know, weep the clouds aboon for smiledown witnesses, and that’ll do now about the fairyhees and the frailyshees. Though Eset fibble it to the zephiroth and Artsa zoom it round her heavens for ever. Creator he has created for his creatured ones a creation. White monothoid? Red theatrocrat? And all the pinkprophets cohalething? Very much so! But however ’twas ’tis sure for one thing, what sherif Toragh voucherfors and Mapqiq makes put out, that the man, Humme the Cheapner, Esc, overseen as we thought him, yet a worthy of the naym, came at this timecoloured place where we live in our paroqial fermament one tide on another, with a bumrush in a hull of a wherry, the twin turbane dhow, The Bey for Dybbling, this archipelago’s first visiting schooner, with a wicklowpattern waxenwench at her prow for a figurehead, the deadsea dugong updipdripping from his depths, and has been repreaching himself like a fishmummer these siktyten years ever since, his shebi by his shide, adi and aid, growing hoarish under his turban and changing cane sugar into sethulose starch (Tuttut’s cess to him!) as also that, batin the bulkihood he bloats about when innebbiated, our old offender was humile, commune and ensectuous from his nature, which you may gauge after the bynames was put under him, in lashons of languages, (honnein suit and praisers be!) and, totalisating him, even hamissim of himashim that he, sober serious, he is ee and no counter he who will be ultimendly respunchable for the hubbub caused in Edenborough."

Wag ka munang umuwi ayoko ng bitin
Sa gabing ito pwede ba tayo malasing
Tumingin sa langit pagmasdan ang bituin
Ano bang dapat kong gawin
Pag ibig ko sayo sana bigyan mo ng pansin
Ayoko ng umasa, Di ko kaya alamin
Mahal kita kahit kaibigan lang ang yong tingin
Lasing na lasing
Malapit ng umaraw
Hindi ko alam
Kung dapat bang sabihin sayo
Nararamdaman ko
Kase alam ko
Ang sagot mo
Ikaw lang walang iba
Sana wag kang mawala
Dahil andito kana
Sa akin ka sumama
Kase kung sino pa yung totoong
Nagmamahal hindi mo
Mabigyang pansin palagi kong
Dinadasal
Na sana ay makita mo
Na ako lang para sayo
Ikaw lang ang aking mundo
Ano bang dapat kong gawin
Wag ka munang umuwi ayoko ng bitin
Sa gabing ito pwede ba tayo malasing
Tumingin sa langit pagmasdan ang bituin
Ano bang dapat kong gawin
Pag ibig ko sayo sana bigyan mo ng pansin
Ayoko ng umasa, Di ko kaya alamin
Mahal kita kahit kaibigan lang ang yong tingin
Gustong magsalita
Ngunit wala kong masabe
Lakas ng loob
Ngayon ka sakin sumapi
Nag iisip kung paano
Ang unang atake
Parang laro ng chess
Ako ang unang namate
Kase naman biglang
Nadale
Ng mahal na reynang
Aking itim na hare
Ang iyong tama
Parang alak na sakin
Pwede ba tayo malasing
Ng walang ibang kasale
Baka sakali
Hindi na puro pasa kalye
Laban o bawi
Sana umubra ang
Ginagawang diskarte
Ano bang dapat kong gawin
Uuwi nalang
Gusto mo ba magpalambing
Ang natitirang oras
Ating samantalahin
Ganon ba talaga pag tinamaan
Ka ng magaling?
Ano bang dapat kong gawin
Wag ka munang umuwi ayoko ng bitin
Sa gabing ito pwede ba tayo malasing
Tumingin sa langit pagmasdan ang bituin
Ano bang dapat kong gawin
Pag ibig ko sayo sana bigyan mo ng pansin
Ayoko ng umasa, Di ko kaya alamin
Mahal kita kahit kaibigan lang ang yong tingin"

Veľa ľudí si dnes myslí že mi jebe
Nadávajú na zmenu keď príde k zmene
Veľa ľudí si dnes myslí že mi jebe
Nerapujem jak v roku 2009
Pozri sa my sme tie deti tých červených pruhov 50tich hviezd
Pozri sa sme v štýle hlboko tak že to nechápeš nevieš to zniesť
Hudba mi dává deep throat ty v nej len plávaš na povrchu pes
A myslíš si že ty si trend keď ti resseller zoženie Supreme a Bape
Wow...Wow... takýchto kokotov poznám
Wow...Wow... som Trevor Philips na svine mám shotgun
Budúcnosti sa bratu nevyhneš aj keď sa ty z trucu nasilu zastavíš
Pozri sa moj vývoj sa nedá zastaviť tak ako v New Yorku sirup od Actavis
Brutálne flowy ,sylabické verše som dával už na deme na tapeoch Dramatikz
Počiatok, Odvaha víťaziť, Headshot, tak pusti si profi rapu základy. (Kokot)
A dnes si už môžem robiť čo cítim po 10tej vodke
A tie tvoje názory sprosté o tej mojej tvorbe, potvrdzujú, že nechceš chápať nič dobré
Tak zostaň v tej dobe, keď bol na vrchole Rocawear a Sean John a G-Unit okay?
Okay ty zmrd? Uź nie je hiphop.sk

LNJH, LNJH, decko
2 0 0 9, to neni naša doba
Nepoznáš ma, nevieš
Rap je v žile droga
2 0 1 6, 2 0 1 6
Ty ostaň kde si bol,ja nechávam sa viesť
Ja nechávam sa viesť, predo mnou toľko ciest
Ja píšem texty kým ty v stoke s homies páliš piest
2 0 1 6 sound a 9 9 flow
Belosi moja droga, hudba je moja hoe
Chlapci zaspali dobu, to neni naša vina
A my sme teraz kokoti, že to robíme ináč
Vyjeb sa na to synak, otvor oči veď si na, omyle, ten zvuk tak zámorie pripomína
Jebem to, jebem to
Jebem to, fuck them all
Jebem to, jebem to
Jebem to, fuck them all

Bolo to vždy o tom že je to extra
Teraz je ešte viac, čo sa ti nezdá
Radšej newschoolerom uvolni miesta
2009 flow môže ísť vieš kam
Sme Panamera a ty Ford Fiesta
Na triku Eminem tak to ti tlieskam
Netreba ti budík všetko si prespal
Zmeň si dátum už je 2016
Som vpred idem off road, nemám CD aj tak dáte download
Budete to ťahať ako coco
Z displeja so zrolovanou stovkou
Tvojej bitch sa vidí môj flow, tebe krvácajú uši oh no
Ona si to ide, hýbe sa jak keby je tanečnica gogo
Obuj si chleby z 2009 a nebuď do nás obutý, (nebuď do nás obutý)
Nejdem s tebou kecať o hudbe, utekám fellákom po rumy, (fellákom po rumy)
Tvoj vkus sa zasekol v tej dobe keď ešte platili koruny, (platili koruny)
Nemôžme za to že neni ti po chuti, 100 ľudí 100 chutí. (100 ľudí 100 chutí)

Ste v roku 2009 ja o sebe neviem jak keď som mal sedem
Ste v roku 2007 ja o sebe neviem jak keď som bol v siedmej
Pisoár napĺňa nedeľný perkelt a SBS háda sa kto ma vyvedie
Nechápu nás, sme z inej dimenzie, Galaxia Y grcáme menzes
Robíme binec raz taký jak predtým, tí MCs čo to nemôžu prežiť
Že robíme to, čo oni len chceli a mrdáme pravidlá, normy aj režim

V tvojej crew je toľko narcisov voláme ju kvetinárstvo
My letíme ako Milenium Falcon
Námestovo neni Compton a ty nie si Pablo
Pretože si videl Narcos si stále na takom istom mieste ako v 2009-tom
My sme deti 90-tok a strelame to ako divoký Django

Kým mŕtvoly odváža smetiarske auto tak zmrdi jak my v noci žijú svoj punkrock
Žijeme horory story preto píšem svoj komix som hrdina galaxy blázon
Neporovnávaj život s Counter Strikeom, jedine pochopíš ako si na tom
Prichádzam rozsekať otočiť kartou, túto hru ktorá je problém jak ja versus zákon
Fuck off, nenosím chain mám na krku lano
V deravom vrecku sa tvorí mi bankrot a smejem sa do ksichtu zubatej priamo, smrť

Trust me daddy
Chceme zarábať prachy nevstávať do roboty pozerať Oggy a šváby
Handry,drogy a baby mám flow ktorá z teba urobí grenadír
Keď vravíš že to už nikdy nebude ako vtedy..nebude !

Sana ay malaman mo
Na hindi peke
Ang pagibig na ibibigay sayo

Kapag naaaninag ka ako'y natataranta (baket)
Yung tila ba nananaginip ng dilat ang mata
Kaduda duda bakit ganito ang tama
Kasing lakas ng gravity ang 'yong ngiti kung
Humila pababa walang kasing tumbas ang tama
Hindi ka na mag hihinala
Ikaw ang number one saakin
Pangarap lang kita pero sana ako'y palarin

Kung hindi pwede
Sana ay malaman mo
Na hindi peke
Ang pagibig na ibibigay sayo

Kung maglaro man at mapadapad kung saan saan
Palagi kang nanjan para ako'y suportahan
Hindi alam kung ano ang  dahilan
Basta sure ako sa aking nararamdaman
Sana naman na ako'y mapagbigyan
Pangarap lang kita wag kapa sanang kabahan
Hindi alam kung ito'y magiging kasalanan
Umibig sa taong tingin sayo ay kaibigan
Kung hindi pwede
Sana ay malaman mo
Na hindi peke
Ang pagibig na ibibigay sayo

Di naman ako salbahe
Pero bakit grabe? Titig sakin
Ng isang babae
Akin bang nadali?
Baby ang ganda ng iyong imahe
Parang model nga eh
Sige sumandal ka lang saakin
Mahaba pa ang biyahe
Linawin mo kung pwede

Kung hindi pwede
Sana'y malaman mo
Na hindi peke
Ang pagibig na ibibigay sayo
Kung hindi pwede
Sana'y maintindihan mo
Na hindi torpe

Never bite my tongue, Clearly I ain't got no limits
Can't be afraid to speak my mind, my rhymes scheme tells me that I'm close to da mastermind
Check my RG, my IQ doesn't lie
My brain sending waves, y'all niggas feel da vibe
If everything has to come into an end
I don't even know why y'all niggas tryna begin
Thanks God for giving me real eyes
To realize that evil lies when it comes to righteous minds..
I be reflecting theories since I'm 14
So lemme unleash everything on my 16
And I'm just cleaning my mind
No writer's block ain't got even the time to look behind
Youthfulness ain't the reflect of the innocence, Open your eyes and you will see the witnesses
Too many people die for the sake of hatred
Feelings are strong enough to make a man commit a mayhem
Barely eager to become a man
I'm still searching for all the things that I don't understand
I mind fuckin' you if you're sapiosexual
My spirit allowed me to keep it colloquial
Clueless speculations upon my reflexion won't get any attention, don't blame the kid to sharpen his vision
You can feel the aura going off my speech
I've reach another level, im just super sayin'
Knowledge the currency that makes me feel rich
Even though I never stop spending it
Y'all can't blame me f‎or the way that I be painting thoughts
Last paint bucket to fight against the odds
I swear I'm sick of that computer science
That wicked shit just trapping my brilliance
Painting my vision of the world
With the eyes a of a kid,don't blame the child to see all the things differently
I tried to make a artwork close to masterpiece
And if I failed I guess I gotta get my work complete
RIP to the brothers who died of stigmata
I promess I will do anything to raise Africa
Meanwhile we gotta support each other
Or in some eyes we'll always be pathetic niggers

Yeah the movie's over
Still got questions with no answer
Go get a brain with a 3d Printer
If your nose don't smell odors wider
Keep that cavity number 6 opened
You'll feel invincible no matter what happen
I'm convinced my section's the best
Section 90 , fuck the rest
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you to all my negus
$uroH, bring the heat
Eiduk, drop the beat

Feeling like I achieve something
My soul lightweight waouh
So it's time to say goodbye

“The killing.”
“And what?”
“The drugs.”
“And what?”
“Them gangstas and them muth fuckin thugs.”

If you run, then you die

This essay examines spaces within hip-hop culture where hip-hop feminist thought and activism might make significant interventions. It offers an exploratory examination of hip-hop feminism in an effort to map out an agenda for the twenty-first century. The essay is not concerned with hard-and-fast answers to the combination of feminism and hip-hop but rather with what hip-hop feminism might add to current conversations surrounding race, class, gender, and sexuality. By examining the conscious/commercial rap dichotomy, the discussions surrounding video models, lyrics by rapper Jean Grae, and the work of contemporary women authors, this essay opens the door for further dialogue about women, rap, and hip-hop feminismI know I’m on the right path
To who I’m gonna be at last
So don’t rush me
I know I’m wrong and right
At the same time both, I’m the dark and light
And they say life means everything to live
At the same time I got everything to give
So don’t rush me Don’t rush me
    -Jean Grae, “Don’t Rush Me”
Trying to capture the voice of all that is young black female was impossible. My goal, instead, was to tell my truth as best I could from my vantage point on the spectrum. And then get you to talk about it. This book by its lonesome won’t give you the truth. Truth is what happens when your cumulative voices fill in the breaks, provide the remixes, and rework the chorus
    -Joan Morgan, When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost: A Hip-Hop Feminist Breaks it Down
The epigraphs from rapper Jean Grae and hip-hop feminist Joan Morgan hint at the varieties and contradictions embedded in hip-hop feminism.1 The third-wave feminist leanings, along with black feminist and womanist agendas, make for a study in shifts and unevenness. The third wave represents the generation of feminists that hip-hop feminism is a part of. This generation of feminists is best represented theoretically in anthologies such as Listen Up: Voices from the Next Feminist Generation (Findlen 1995), To Be Real: Telling the Truth and Changing the Face of Feminism (Walker 1995), The Fire This Time: Young Activists and the New Feminism (Labaton and Martin 2004), Colonize This! Young Women of Color on Today’s Feminism (Hernandez and Rehman 2002), and Catching a Wave: Reclaiming Feminism for the 21st Century (Dicker and Piepmeier 2003). The black feminist and womanist agendas are agendas that hip-hop feminists, the majority of whom are black women, share with their foremothers who saw their struggles with gender oppression as intimately connected to their struggles with race and class oppressions. They were women whose agendas kept firmly in sight the survival of the entire people. A hip-hop state of mind—one that freely samples, mixes, and remixes—influences the theoretical underpinnings of hip-hop feminism as well as the activism of hip-hop feminists. This essay highlights some of the ways hip-hop feminist agendas have taken shape while always keeping in mind, as the epigraphs from Jean Grae and Joan Morgan show, there won’t be just one truth but multiple ones. In fact, sometimes the contradictions that make for the “wrong and right . . . dark and light” of it will help feminists to better do what Joan Morgan suggests feminism needs to do—be “brave enough to fuck with the grays” (1999, 59). This essay is an exploratory essay that seeks to examine the various articulations of hip-hop feminist expressions as a way to provide a starting point and possible template for a hip-hop feminist agenda
Women have been representing in hip-hop culture ever since the mid 1970s, when the culture got its start in the South Bronx, and they represent still. They have been and still are B-girls, women breakers, graffiti artists, deejays, and emcees. Today, we can add to the mix women writing and thinking about the culture who call themselves hip-hop feminists. I take the stance that hip-hop is a cultural phenomenon that expands beyond rap music. Hip-hop has been defined by many as a way of life that encompasses everything from way of dress to manner of speech. Hip-hop as a culture originally included graffiti writing, deejaying, break dancing, rap music, and the oft-forgotten fifth element, knowledge.  It has recently expanded to include genres such as film, spoken word, autobiographies, literature, journalism, and activism. It has also expanded enough to include its own brand of feminism. The writing of third-wave black feminist writers such as Ayana Byrd, Denise Cooper, Eisa Davis, Eisa Nefertari Ulen, Shani Jamilla, dream hampton, Joan Morgan, Tara Roberts, Kristal Brent-Zook, and Angela Ards is expanding black feminist theory and black women’s intellectual traditions in fascinating ways. What started out as a few young black feminist women who loved hip-hop and who tried to mesh that love with their feminist and womanist consciousness is now a rich body of articles, essays, poetry, and creative nonfiction. But what exactly is a hip-hop feminist? And what does hip-hop feminism do? I maintain that although we now have a relatively clear idea of what constitutes a hip-hop feminist, we are less certain about what a hip-hop feminist agenda should be
Hip-hop feminists are women and men who step up and speak out against gender exploitation in hip-hop. From the Feminism and Hip-Hop Conference at the University of Chicago in 2005 to the B-Girl Be conferences in Minneapolis and countless symposiums and smaller conferences on the status of women in hip-hop to the list serves and Yahoo groups devoted to women, feminism, and hip-hop, there appears to be a surge in women and men thinking and talking about gender issues in hip-hop and combining that talk with action. From the publication of several key essays and Joan Morgan’s pivotal book When Chickenheads Come Home To Roost in the 1990s to the Spelman women who wanted to initiate a dialogue with Nelly to Essence Magazine’s “Take Back the Music” campaign, we can begin to see the ways this movement’s knowledge-building and consciousness-raising have taken shape. It might be too soon to talk about the impact that the movement has had, but it is not too soon to think about some of the key concerns and agendas that the movement seems to be taking up. I aim to flesh some of this out by building on some of the work that I did in my book Check It While I Wreck It: Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture and the Public Sphere (2004) and by examining a few areas where women have used hip-hop to claim a public voice. I want to look at the spaces where hip-hop feminism can make interventions as starting points for a possible feminist agenda in hip-hop. However, they will not all be feminist spaces or even have outright feminists messages. Instead, they are spaces where hip-hop feminists, activists, and thinkers can possibly evoke change
Krista Ratcliffe (2006) writes about giving her students a feminist literacy through which to read society. Elaine Richardson carefully details the ways in which the young women who listen to and love hip-hop process the images and have thoughtful and critical conversations about the culture and the music when she examines female hip-hop literacies in her book Hiphop Literacies (2006).  And it has me thinking seriously about what a hip-hop feminist literacy would allow us to do and why we need one. Thinking of recent controversies such as Don Imus calling the Rutgers women’s basketball team “nappy-headed hoes” and Michael Richards’s meltdown in which he boldly and blatantly brandished the n-word at black men he thought were hecklers and the quick way just about everyone quickly made a move to blame hip-hop has me seriously considering what a worldwide hip-hop feminist literacy could give us in these situations. Would we continue to have conversations that blame rappers for white racist men doing what white racist men do all day every day? Or would we instead be able to really look at the nuances of the situation and see, for example, that while there was some racism underlying Imus’s statement, the sexism and underlying homophobia were palpable. And like racism, the sexism and homophobia predates hiphop in Imus’s politics and certainly in this country that deals with both on a regular. But even as we had these conversations and teased out these issues with our hip-hop feminist lens, we would still be able to critique hip-hop for its sexism and homophobia as well. We just wouldn’t blame hip-hop when people old enough to know better show their true colors, colors they have been showing all along. The fact is that young women who listen to rap music and participate in hip-hop culture already have critiques of sexism and misogyny. They have things to say about the culture and the world around them if we are prepared to listen. This essay is therefore an attempt at understanding what they might offer the larger society the next time we have such public pedagogical moments as those offered by Imus and Richards
So, Shorty’s a Feminist?
Several black and third-wave feminists have started to approach the tenuous relationship between rap music/hip-hop culture and feminism in their writing. They offer a variety of different feminist perspectives on rap, rappers, and women. Some condemn the sexism in rap and encourage others to do the same. Others offer complicated analyses that critique the larger societal issues that contribute to rap’s sexism, production, and consumption. Some offer third-wave feminist critiques that question how one can be a child of the hip-hop generation, love the music, and still critique and actively speak out against the sexism. They all offer examples of how feminists have begun to deal with, think about, and write about rap music and hip-hop culture
Most hip-hop feminists believe that some of the needs of the hip-hop generation require new strategies and different voices. They have a strong  relationship to the “self,” and they connect their personal narratives with theoretical underpinnings and critique. They hold themselves and their peers responsible for effecting change in the present and future by encouraging people to recognize and combat their own complicity. In terms of rap music and hip-hop culture, they want to find ways to move beyond counting the amount of times a particular rapper says the word “bitch” or “ho” to a focus on what they consider to be larger issues and concerns. For example, they also want to begin to complicate understandings of women’s complicity in the objectification of women especially as it pertains to video-hoes. And as Joan Morgan reminds us, “the focus of Black feminists has got to change. We can’t afford to keep expending energy on banal discussion of sexism in rap when sexism is only part of a huge set of problems” (1999, 76). They are concerned with and spend a lot of time writing about black women’s relationships with black men. They want to encourage a dialogue between black men and women, men rappers and women
A hip-hop feminist is more than just someone who likes to listen to rap music and feels conflicted about it. A hip-hop feminist is someone who is immersed in hip-hop culture and experiences hip-hop as a way of life. Hip-hop as a culture, in turn, influences his or her worldview or approach to life. In fact, one of the reasons why Elaine Richardson, Aisha Durham, Rachel Raimist, and I decided to edit Home Girls Make Some Noise: A Hip-Hop Feminism Anthology (2007) was because we wanted to think about hip-hop feminism beyond the conflicted, “I’m a feminist and I love hip-hop, woe-is-me” standpoint. We wanted to create a space to talk across disciplines through activism, the arts, and academia to better understand the very important and vital work going on in this area. Hip-hop feminists are working as community activists. They are working for reproductive justice. And they are trying to think about ways to combat the growing prison-industrial complex in relation to women of color and the equally astounding HIV/AIDS rates. And they are also still very much concerned with representations of women of color in rap music videos and the harm that these images can do. So, I want to move now to one area that hip-hop feminism continues to grapple with: the video vixen
Shorty Wants to be a Star: Video Vixens Representing Women of Color?
In her groundbreaking book, Prophets of the Hood, Imani Perry notes the following about the recent trends in hip-hop music videos: “It seemed to happen suddenly. Every time one turned on BET (Black Entertainment  Television) or MTV, one encountered a disturbing music video: Black men rapped surrounded by dozens of black and Latina women dressed in bathing suits, or scantily clad in some other fashion. Video after video proved the same, each one more objectifying than the former. Some took place in strip clubs, some at the pool, at the beach, or in hotel rooms, but the recurrent theme was dozens of half-naked women” (2004, 175). With the release of Karrine Steffans’s tell-all memoir, Confessions of a Video Vixen (2005), the topic of women, music videos, and objectification is once again on everyone’s minds. But even more so, the questions surrounding objectification have become complicated in important ways. No longer can we make claims about what is happening to the women in the videos without complicating the discussion by adding their voices. Although Steffans says that she wrote the book as a cautionary tale for little girls who want to grow up and be video girls, the book reads more like a how-to with just enough name-dropping and gossip to fill inquiring minds. In fact, with the release of It’s No Secret by Carmen Bryan, rapper Nas’s ex-girlfriend and the mother of his child, it seems as if some marketing person in the publishing industry figured out a way to capitalize on mixing the current Zane-inspired erotica fervor with hip-hop glitterati in order to cater to a gossip-obsessed culture and recent trends in reality programming. These kinds of books appeal to a variety of people because of the way they play into the genres listed above. However, what does come across clearly as one reads the Steffans’s memoir and Bryan’s tell-all are the ways in which some women have chosen to buy into the sexism and misogyny that limits the roles that women can play in hip-hop culture
The issues of representation and objectification in hip-hop offer many variables that all must be considered if we are going to have a meaningful conversation about the topic. The ways in which the men artists and male and female video directors objectify the women in their lyrics and videos is one aspect. The ways in which the women video models and hip-hop artists choose to objectify themselves in a quest to make money and earn a living is another. And the way these images straddle the very thin line between validation of black women bodies and objectification is yet another aspect. The truth of the matter is that we are now in a(n) historical moment where the bodies of women of color flood popular culture in ways that they never have before. As hip-hop culture expands and dominates mainstream popular culture, the hip-hop video becomes more than just a music video. The impact of these videos on women of color is vast. Hip-hop music videos are spreading representations of U.S. women of color around the globe. 
I have written elsewhere that hip-hop culture did not spring up full grown on its own and that it builds on other legacies that exist in the culture and the community that we are not always willing to own (see Pough 2001). Others have noted that hip-hop does not exist in a social-cultural vacuum, that as a part of the larger culture it takes on elements of the larger culture as well (see Potter 1995; Rose 1994). So when we look at the hip-hop centerfolds that exist in Source Magazine and XXL, with their monthly “Dime Piece” and “Eye Candy” sections, we cannot discuss them in isolation and certainly not without at least mentioning the long-running Jet Magazine “Beauty of the Week.” And when we talk about the ways in which hip-hop videos are similar to pornography, we cannot have the conversation without looking at the ways in which pornography has infiltrated the larger culture as well. Can you say “girls gone wild”?
None of this is meant to take away from the damage that these pornographic images of women of color in hip-hop do. What I do want to look at, however, are the ways in which these tropes impact our thoughts about women of color and how they in turn impact the lives of young women. The words of women like Zulaika Jumaralli (2005) who claim “Music Videos Broke My Spirit” come to mind as I think about the power of these videos and the impact that they have. I think of women like the black women students at Duke, who, outraged by the recent alleged gang rape of a black woman by white members of the university lacrosse team, loudly proclaim, that they are “not your video ho.” In an article written by Fiona Morgan (2006), these students share stories of being expected to be sexually available and inappropriately propositioned by white men on campus just because of their race. One student says, “As a black female, you go to a party. You’re expected to dance. You’re expected to be sexually provocative. You are expected to want to be touched, to be grabbed, to be fondled.” Another student adds, “As if they’re reenacting a rap video or something. As if we’re their video ho, basically. We can’t just be regular students here. We can’t just go to a party and enjoy ourselves” (F. Morgan 2006). As much as we try to move away from allowing negative images to impact our lives, there are real implications that we need to contend with. Add to this the multiple stories of black women who have traveled to other parts of the world only to be approached as if they are a video vixen by the men in the countries they are visiting, and we can see how far these attitudes about women of color extend
I also think about the hip-hop feminist warriors who are bringing wreck in the public sphere by talking back—women like the Spelman women, who wanted to initiate a dialogue with Nelly after viewing his derogatory video  “Tip Drill,” only to have that attempt at dialogue stilted and to receive criticism themselves for being elitist college women looking down their noses at the women who are making an honest living in the video and the poor artist who only wants to share his art with the world. While I offer the statements above in a tongue-in-cheek manner, several interviews in which Nelly spoke about his “ordeal” painted the Spelman women in this way. I am also informed by hip-hop feminist writers like Karen R. Good, who, fed-up with the whole images, representation, and objectification debates, offers her own treatise:But as of late, many of hip-hop’s children have been playing the cheapest trick: depending on undulating female, colored bodies to entice weak minds and compensate for weak rhymes. Or our bodies are used for verbal target practice. I am way past anger. Shock went the way of “Bitches Ain’t Shit.” Don’t feel like being sad. I just wonder about the worth of a black girl. You know, like the difference between what happens when little white girls go missing and little black girls go missing. Or get raped. Pissed on. That type of shit. . . . That said, not one more lecture. I put my hands up. Man, if you want to swipe a credit card down the crack of a woman’s behind, or Miss, if you want to let yo ass be the machine, fine. To each his own. The culprit is not hip-hop, which is undergoing a beautiful evolution, by the way (hear Mos Def’s “The Rape Over”), it’s our reliance on the baser nature as opposed to the higher mind. Hip-hop is the thinker’s form. (2005, 29–30)As I think about the video vixen and her relationship to a hip-hop feminist agenda, I do so keeping the fervor and the sentiment of these very different responses to the images in mind. As the black women students at Duke remind us, the images have the power to hurt. As the negative backlash to the Spelman women shows us, when we speak out or try to initiate a dialogue, we open ourselves up for criticism. And as Karen Good reminds us, the images are not the sum and total of hip-hop and certainly not what is representative of the culture, which is in constant evolution. But they do exist and we do need to interrogate them. And when we do, we need to add to the mix the voices, stories, and reasons these women give for participating in the objectification. Only then will we get a more nuanced and complicated discussion of the video vixen
By adding their voices, we indeed get a discussion that highlights the gray areas that Joan Morgan writes about. These women see the videos as their entry into the world of stardom. They are aspiring actresses, models, singers, and even rappers themselves. They gladly pose in the magazines and preen in the videos, and the best and brightest of them are paid very well  to do so. Some even make up to $3,000 a day.2 These are not necessarily the poor, victimized women of old. Some of them have a critique of the business, and they recognize their role in a society in which sex sells. Video girl Tawny, interviewed by Jeanne Amber for Essence Magazine, notes: “If video girls are being exploited, then every female artist who is out there being sexy should be blamed too. To me, it’s all bull——” (Amber 2005, 165). Former video model, BET host, and entrepreneur Melyssa Ford notes of her own career and decisions:I’m the highest-paid video girl to date. I’ve endured all the snide comments and ignorant remarks from people who presume to know me because I’m on their television screens and in the pages of their magazines. But I’m not the promiscuous twit I’m often mistaken for. I am a business-woman who has used videos to launch a multimedia career. My product is me. Besides being the lead girl in hip-hop and R&B videos, I am a sex columnist for a men’s magazine. I star in my own DVD. I’ve hosted television shows, and I’ve produced my own calendar, which I sell on the internet. My job is to sell fantasy and perfection. When the cameras go on, I detach myself and play the sexy vixen who will turn a nigga out. (quoted in Byrd and Solomon 2005, 219–20)The fact is, these women are making decisions—decisions informed by a variety of variables—to be in these videos, to pose for these magazines. While I do not pretend that their decision-making takes away from the systems of oppression surrounding them that make not making the decision to objectify themselves difficult, I do not want to ignore the agency, real or imagined, that these women have. How does their agency complicate our discussions of objectification? I don’t pretend to have the answer to this, and I don’t even want to suggest that there is one cut-and-dry answer. But I do know that as feminists, we can no longer have these conversations without including their voices and their stories. And when we add their voices and stories to the mix, they bring with them those dark and light, wrong and right mixtures that Jean Grae raps about and the subtle shades of gray that Joan Morgan writes about
The video vixen’s agency is important, and the work of visual artist Ayanah Moor adds layers to this conversation by thinking about the ways these women may be exhibiting agency even as they participate in the demeaning videos. Her collection of video shots, “STILL,” is one example of the way Moor uses her art to complicate the discussion. The text that goes along with the montage of video stills represented in the collection states: STILL Images of women surrounding male rap stars in music videos is as common as the jewel encrusted subject matter of today’s rap lyrics. Females are seen in packs hovering around male rap stars, playing the part of enthusiastic cheerleader or die-hard groupie. Rap music videos sell not only hiphop culture, but also the very image of its women. They serve as eye candy designed to satisfy an assumed male video audience, affirming critiques of the culture as hyper masculine and misogynist. STILL is a series of photographs from contemporary rap music videos. These artworks invite a second look at the hip-hop video vixen, displaying an interest in moments unintended by music video narratives. Some stills reveal agency rather than victimization, while others provide reminders of the narrow representations of women in hip-hop. (Moor 2006)Moor’s “STILL,” the hip-hop feminist discussions surrounding video models, and the video models voices and stories show, I hope, what a rich space the issues of video images and representation can be if we think about issues of agency in more complicated ways. Combining these might allow us to better interrogate the following questions. For example, what does it mean that hip-hop has the capability to make a woman a pseudosuperstar, sought after by magazines and video directors based on solely on how she looks? And how does this further complicate our understandings of how black women respond to things like the ideal beauty image? Does the influx of other kinds of beauty—meaning black and women of color—into the mainstream disrupt the norm? Does it simply add yet another impossible ideal for women to yearn for that now makes women of color, particularly black women, vulnerable in ways that they haven’t been in the past? All of these questions are complicated and warrant far more space than this cursory look at possible hip-hop feminist agendas allows. But they are spaces in which hip-hop feminism can make meaningful interventions. I will now move to another space in which there are possibilities for a hip-hop feminist agenda by examining female emcee Jean Grae
Shorty Got Love for the Game: Jean Grae,Hip-Hop, Feminism, and change (Or ... Simply... I wish she were a feminist...)
What would happen if we had feminist emcees moving millions toward a critique of gender that motivated them toward change? Why haven’t we had any women emcees with this kind of feminist agenda? What would happen if we could harness the power that rap music has to make people dance and make them work toward change in women’s lives? When studying  feminism in relation to hip-hop, one thing becomes abundantly clear: most women emcees are not checking for the F word. They won’t claim it. Won’t label themselves with it. Will not touch it. This is not to say that there are no feminist women rappers. However, the fact remains that as much as we champion and claim certain women rappers for their lyrics, their outreach activities, their “positive” messages, or their “prowoman” messages, very few women rappers will go on record saying that they are feminist
Taking a page from black feminist theorist Patricia Hill Collins, who in her essay “What’s in a Name? Womanism, Black Feminism, and Beyond” (1999) ultimately comes to the conclusion that quibbling over what we call ourselves is less important than the work we do to evoke change, I posit that while we cannot in good conscience place the label of “feminist”—hip-hop, thirdwave, black feminist, or womanist—on most contemporary women rappers, we can—as feminist scholars and activists—use the music they produce and the issues they raise to begin to enact change. In this regard, rising hip-hop artist Jean Grae becomes an interesting case study for hip-hop feminism even if she denounces feminism for herself: “I’m not a feminist by any means, I just want people to enjoy the music” (Thomas 2004). In much of her music to date—her two CDs, Attack of the Attacking Things: The Dirty Mixes and This Week, as well as her EP, The Bootleg of the Bootleg—we can easily see the concerns of hip-hop feminists put to music
Grae’s two albums and EP have garnered critical acclaim, and just about every review I have read noted her stellar lyrics and vocal delivery but bemoaned the production and the lack of killer beats. What comes across in most interviews is the fact that she is going to make music and have a career on her own terms. We won’t see her taking off her clothes to sell records. But she is quick to stop interviewers who want to label her the Anti–Lil’ Kim, Anti–Foxy Brown, or Anti-Trina. She does not have a problem with her fellow women rappers. She has a problem with an industry that won’t allow a fullness of black womanhood to be represented. She notes: “You know what, that’s not me. That’s not how I live. And that’s not how I do. But there are females that do. I think it’s messed up that there is not an opportunity for someone who is not doing that to have an equal chance. And that is the problem. It’s like there has to be some choice . . . have some other shit. Balance it all out. Apparently for some odd reason, that is not allowed” (Bloom 2004). She knows what she is willing to do and she knows what she has to offer: “I want to break the formula, and make history for myself. I want people to know I’m a skilled writer and lyricist that isn’t afraid to be honest. I’m stubborn. I refuse to change myself  for a machine” (Dyer 2004). I have to admit, when it comes to hip-hop, I am all about the lyrics. The beat is important, yes—couldn’t be a true hip-hop head and not acknowledge that. But the beat is not going to make me buy the record. In fact, I’m much more excited when the beat takes me back to the essence, the simple boom bap. So, the reviews that bemoaned the lack of cutting-edge production and beats on Jean Grae’s CDs didn’t faze me. Her lyrics blew me away. Her lyrics, style, and delivery are like one part Jigga, two parts Nas, a healthy dose of gender consciousness, race consciousness, and, lo and behold, a pinch of a global awareness for good measure
On her first album, Attack of the Attacking Things, Jean Grae critiques the sexism in hip-hop. In the song “Knock” she raps, “Ask me bastard if I’m signed / I rhyme sick / but niggas is quick to turn they back on spitters with clits / Hit em with this, and ridiculous phrase flow that exit my lips / Hey yo, I mean my face, though / they still want chicks with tits and ass out / my respect is worth more than your advance cash-out.” In the song “What Would I Do?” she raps: “I’m Jean Grae, honorable team player for years / Emceeing on the low, in videos devoid of the hoes / For sho’ it’s crunch time / I’m the one they sent to piss your label off / they won’t fuck with me unless I’m parading and taking it off.” She is very conscious of the sexism in the music industry and the exploitation of women in particular. And her lyrics and her interviews show that she is raging against that machine
Perhaps what is most worthy of mention is the way that the song “What Would I Do?” aims to inspire change. The chorus asks: “What, what, what would I do? / If like my people said, I left it to you. / Tell me what, what, what would I do. / If I didn’t try a verse, if I didn’t rhyme. / Tell me what, what, what would I do. / If I just hated and did nothing to change it” The chorus makes the listeners question themselves as well. For all of us complaining about the status of hip-hop, what are we doing to change it? Listening to Attack of the Attacking Things is almost like reading Joan Morgan’s When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost. Although the outright feminist agenda is missing from Jean Grae’s album, the themes that come out in Morgan’s book about the need for change and the vulnerability of wanting to be loved are all there
Perhaps the most poignant representation of a hip-hop feminist state of mind and potential agenda comes across in the song “P.S.” from Grae’s latest CD, This Week. The song is a series of e-mails, which are basically apologies to people she has wronged in the past, a friend she betrayed, a lover she  cheated on, and herself. The song calls to mind the hip-hop feminist need to question our complicity in our oppression. She questions it and owns it. In the last verse she raps:Dear Jean
I see you’re doing big things
Congratulations, hey I even saw that big ring
Who would of thunk it huh? LOL
You even seem content
I notice that you’re more focused
Drinking less as well
Anyways it’s been too many months having henny days
I think it’s plenty brave, plus you get your pennies saved up
And say what?!? Second album?
Whatever happened to the thought of ending rapping?
Still living in Manhattan?
Sidetracking note, just on the low
All apologies, I used to hate your fucking guts
Please pardon me, tried to kill you more than once
I’ve acted horribly, and all my pessimism towards your life
Still bothers me
But you’re a big girl now
You’ve fought and made it through
Best of luck homie
And everything I say is true
XOXO Space Smiley Face dot dot dot
Comma Much Love, youThe fact that the speaker in this rap is writing this particular e-mail to her “self” is telling; it brings to mind many questions about how young black women internalize the negative influences bombarding them. Hip-hop feminist writings have dealt with some of these issues. What has been criticized as a self-absorption and an excessive focus on the individual in most hiphop feminist writings is really a genuine concern and a search for meaning, particularly what it means to be a young woman in often dangerous urban environments; what it means to be a woman who participates in and loves a culture that doesn’t always love you; and how you deal with it when some of the hatred aimed at you becomes internalized and affects how you treat others and how you feel about yourself. Jean Grae’s “P.S.” is all of those hip-hop feminist questions and issues put to music. And in a world where young black women grapple with so many images that objectify and sexualize them, such artistry is needed. I move now to a discussion of one of the most  problematic images that young women who listen to contemporary hip-hop face: the ride-or-die chick
Shorty Wanna Ride? Ride or Die Chicks and Real Black GirlsBut got a women that ain’t afraid
To tuck the toast in the escalade
Pop on niggas that showin me shade
But only for the Rule ’cause that’s my baby
Got me a down ass bitch with red hair, that don’t care
Blazed by the shots and flares
Girl c’mon, follow me, and bust back at police
Conceal ya heat
-- Ja Rule, “Down Ass Bitch”Shorty, you ridin’ with me?
Stic tell ’em bought them RBGs
I like ’em real trill
Gold in the grill
Cold as Pam Grier swoll in the rear
Hard, smart, strong in the heart
Sexy thong when we alone in the dark
Dark skin, red bone, slim in the waist
Them legs so long
Queen earth, jean skirt, head wrapped up
Pimping them converse
And she down for the dirt
For better or for worse
Got my gun in her purse
In case a nigga get searched
She got a mind like Assata
A body like Trina
A heart like my momma
Nigga tell me have you seen her?
-- Dead Prez, “Real Black Girl (Revolutionary Love)”Finding a way to combine feminism and hip-hop in politically meaningful ways is one of the premier goals of hip-hop feminism. This is not easy work. The negative lyrics of most contemporary hip-hop are enough to make even the most die-hard hip-hop feminist contemplate giving up the music and the culture. Articles by dream hampton (2001) and Eisa Nefertari Ulen and Tara Roberts (2000) both speak volumes about the frustration of being a hip-hop head who is also a feminist. 
The fastest-growing prison population statistically in this country is black women. They are going to jail largely because of their relationships with men who are involved with criminal activities. They are going to jail for things like smuggling drugs; they are women like Kemba Smith, who simply fell in love with the wrong man and was too afraid to leave. As Smith recounts, “At age 24, without so much as a parking ticket on my record, I was sentenced to more than 24 years in prison—without parole. Technically, I was convicted of conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine, but I contend that I went to jail for dating a drug dealer.” She was finally pardoned as a last minute act of President Clinton, but she still feels that justice was not served. She notes, “You’d think I’d have been doing cartwheels when I was released. Truthfully, my feelings were in conflict. It was tough to leave behind the incredible women I met in prison—especially since many of them were victims of the same laws that put me away” (Booth 2001, 86). The incarceration rate for black women continues to grow because of the messages young women are getting from the videos. Messages from contemporary rap lyrics about being a “down ass chick” are everywhere, and they are not just coming from men. Women rappers also rap about the illegal things they would do for their men
In my book (Pough 2004), I critiqued the image of the ride-or-die chick as it is represented in hip-hop, the girl willing to do whatever she can for her man, a girl that the lyrics of Ja Rule’s “Down Ass Chick” call to mind. I urged black feminists in particular to look at these representations as a threat to young black womanhood and to find ways to have conversations with young women and reach out to them before we lose an entire generation. The situation was and still is that dire for me. However, I’d like to complicate things just a little by thinking about what I see as another version, albeit a revolutionary version, of the down ass chick. The recent revolutionary but gangsta messages from rap group Dead Prez have also included some interesting messages for what they call Real Black Girls—girls who are “down for the dirt, / for better or for worse, / got my gun in a purse / in case a nigga get searched.”
Given the hip-hop feminist fondness for all things ’70s and revolutionary, it is easy to see how a RBG (Real Black Girl/Revolutionary but Gangsta) image is more appealing than a Down Ass Chick. The reggae beat of the song and the reggae chant of the first stanza calls to mind those Black Panther sisters we see in all the footage of that time but never hear about. Or the revolutionary sisters who are still in prison as political prisoners for their acts against the establishment but whose names we have yet to learn, let alone start a Free (fill in the blank) Movement for. 
Now, I’m not going to argue that down ass chicks and real black girls are problematic for the same reasons. That’s not the point of the comparison. The point of the comparison is to look at the ways in which a mentality of being down for whatever—even when that whatever is revolution—can add to the growing black women prison rate. The point is also to complicate our thinking about hip-hop in ways that stop us from creating dichotomies that place rappers like Ja Rule in one category labeled commercial, negative, and therefore bad, and rappers like Dead Prez and others in another pile labeled conscious, underground, revolutionary, and therefore good. The point isn’t to single out Dead Prez, because they do build on a legacy of the Black Power Movement that had its own gender issues to work out. Even though one would hope that in the twenty-first century conscious rappers would not be replicating those dated and retrograde ideas in such problematic ways. And even though I have no problem with the concept of doing what we have to do for the revolution, per se, I have to ask, if we are talking about a revolution, then what is my role in it, brother? Is a woman’s role in the revolution still pussy power and prone and now I have to conceal your weapon to boot? All of that aside, my point in using Dead Prez’s “Real Black Girl’s (Revolutionary Love)” as an example is simply to say that if we are pushing hip-hop feminism forward as a movement concerned with creating change in the culture and eventually change in the world, we cannot be one-sided with our critiques. Everyone gets called out if they need to be called out. Thinking about “Real Black Girls” as a derivative of the “Down Ass Chick” is one area that we could exam that would allow us to break apart some of the false dichotomies between conscious and commercial hip-hop
In her novel Picture Me Rollin’ (2005), Black Artemis tells the tale of a young woman who has been released from jail on a mandatory gun possession charge. The protagonist, Esperanza, was dating a street entrepreneur who dabbled in armed robbery when she got caught in the getaway vehicle with a gun that he gave her. She was the only one out of the crew to serve time, mainly as a lesson because she refused to testify—to snitch—against the guys. When the novel opens, Esperanza is being released from jail, and throughout the novel she grapples with several things. The first is “Thug Life,” an obsession with rapper 2Pac Shakur that is so delusional she thinks that the rapper is still alive and chilling in Cuba with Assata Shakur. The second is her newfound knowledge of women of color feminism, thanks to her older sister’s community college course books. And the third is her old life as a drug dealer and generic ride-or-die chick for her drug dealer boyfriend Jesus. Esperanza  tries throughout the novel to make a better life for herself, and Black Artemis does an excellent job of showing another side—a female side—of growing up in the urban environments and landscapes made famous by hip-hop
The character Esperanza offers some insight that we all need to consider as we grapple with and complicate the down ass chick. In the prologue to the novel, Esperanza is getting ready to be released from prison and is having a talk with fellow prisoner and roommate Isoke, a political prisoner jailed for her activity with the Black Liberation movement. Isoke is trying to get Esperanza to move beyond an embrace of 2Pac’s “Thug Life” in order to join the larger struggle. Isoke also works in the prison library, so she has given Esperanza a lot of things to read. At this point, however, if it isn’t related to 2Pac, Esperanza is not really interested in reading it. When Isoke flat-out asks her if she is going to be a thug or a revolutionary the older political prisoner lectures to Esperanza: “Because I’m afraid that brother 2Pac was wrong. Thug Life is not the new Black Power. It makes no sense to rage against the machine without purpose or principle. You cannot be both a gangsta and a soldier, Esperanza, so you must choose.” In response to this, Esperanza sighs and thinks “neither ’cause either way I’ll end up back in this muthafucka or dead.” When Esperanza speaks, she responds, “All I know is that I am never coming back here” (Artemis 2005, 2). Esperanza’s words bring the connection between the lyrics of Ja Rule’s “Down Ass Chick” and Dead Prez’s “Real Black Girls” home in powerful ways. We can see that when it comes down to it, there really isn’t that much difference between the oppression and the limitations placed on women; that patriarchy in criminal circles is not better or worse than patriarchy in revolutionary circles; that patriarchy in gangsta rap is no worse or better than patriarchy in conscious rap
What the novel and the lyrics highlight to me is a real need for hip-hop feminism to be engaged with all aspects of black girls’ lives—we don’t want to be accused of being irrelevant to young black women in the ways that some of us have categorized academic black feminism. It makes no sense to pick and choose images and the artists who create the images and lyrics by deeming some negative and some positive, all the while creating false dichotomies. The issues and the artists are much more complicated than these simplistic readings allow. Rappers like 2Pac Shakur, Dead Prez, Common, Mos Def, and others are nothing if not complicated and sometimes conflicted young men. A cursory look at their work shows us that. Hip-hop feminism needs to be bolder in its critiques, even if it means calling out the so-called good guys every once and a while. 
Shorty Wrote this Book Yo!: Hip-hop and Feminism, Is it Fiction?
In her 2001 novel, The Haunting of Hip-Hop, author, lecturer, and scholar Bertice Berry tells the chilling tale of a Harlem brownstone haunted by souls tortured due to U.S. racism and oppression. One of the souls, a former enslaved African, has a message for the hip-hop generation: “We gave the drum back to your generation in the form of rap, but it’s being used to send the wrong message” (Berry 2001). The novel tells the story of rap producer Harry “Freedom” Hudson and his lawyer Ava Vercher
If Freedom represents hip-hop in the novel, then Ava represents the consciousness that echoes in hip-hop’s ear and tries to keep it on a righteous path. Ava Vercher is a new-age Afrocentric womanist with uplift tendencies. Freedom is a producer who makes two kinds of music: one is the kind of commercial music record companies want and the other is “music that no major record label would ever release because it was filled with the messages of love he longed for and the revolution he dreamed of starting” (Berry 2001, 16). You see that the ghost of the enslaved African has been haunting Freedom ever since he was a child, and he hopes to influence Freedom to do the right thing with the drum before it is too late
I’ve found the most compelling representations of hip-hop feminist representations in hip-hop literature. This is not to say that we should discount the music or the nonfiction writings of hip-hop feminists but simply to offer other spaces within hip-hop culture in which people are trying to imagine a better way. I closed Check It While I Wreck It with the call for us all to imagine a better way to use the culture of hip-hop to enact change. I believe that some women writers of popular fiction have begun to do just that
In the “Reader’s Guide: A Conversation with Black Artemis” at the end of her first novel Explicit Content, Black Artemis defines hip-hop fiction as fiction “about hip-hop as a subculture, as something that gives people voice and their lives meaning.” For her, “hip-hop is a form of cultural power and whether that power is a force for progress or destruction depends on how people use it, whether you use it on the street or in the studio, for fun or for profit, to build or destroy” (2004, 338). Of the recent trend to call urban fiction hip-hop fiction, she notes:I think that street life should be referred to as street life fiction, period, and that the term “hip-hop fiction” should be reserved for novels that are about hip-hop. Eventually, there’ll be some works that can be referred to as both, but something that has nothing to do with hip-hop subculture should not  be referred to as hip-hop fiction, especially if it perpetuates the myth that hip-hop is all about violence, drugs, misogyny, etc. These phenomena are not the sum total of hip-hop, and hip-hop is not the only subculture in which those elements exist so it is wrong to treat them as if they are one and the same. (2004, 339)Her distinction has caused me to rethink many of my earlier definitions about what constitutes hip-hop fiction and cinema. The distinction is necessary and important for those of us looking for ways to more fully use the youth culture to enact change. And it does not rely on a dichotomy of positive and negative, conscious and commercial. The work simply has to be about one of the elements of hip-hop culture to be classified as such
Black Artemis’s Explicit Content documents the story of two women rappers, one black and one Latina. The novel explores what it is like to be a female with rapping skills trying to gain recognition in the music industry. It follows the women into the world of hip-hop and examines their hopes and dreams. It’s also a novel about female friendship, with just enough drama to keep the average hip-hop head focused and interested. The two women are a rap duo to rival all rap duos until a gangsta rap label comes between them. Of her work Black Artemis notes, “in these times when hip-hop is often used as a cultural weapon of destruction, my mission as a hip-hop artist and activist is to tell stories that relay the power of hip-hop as a tool of transformative expression” (2004, 340). The activist in her comes across in her fiction. It is fiction with a mission; in the tradition of the poets and playwrights of the Black Arts Movement who created art for people’s sake, Black Artemis’s art has an activist goal and agenda in mind
Another writer who has political threads in her work is L. A. Banks. Her Vampire Huntress Legends focus on the life of spoken word artist and vampire huntress, Damali Richards. She is the Neturu, which means God’s divine power latent within humans. She is the only Neturu to span two millennia. Damali uses her art—her spoken word music—to bring the light. Her lyrics are about hope in a time of hopelessness. And her band is also her vampire hunting crew. When I asked Banks why she decided to write horror and focus on vampires, she replied: “I wrote this series because I’m a mother living in the urban environment—and horror, because I have been horrified by what I see on the nightly news, and hear on the trolleys and subways, and by what I read in the newspapers. Vampires—because they suck blood, in a metaphor, they suck the life-blood out of the community as predators, and really have no sense of mortality or moral compass. I  wanted to create a cautionary tale, but one that also delved into the social, economic, and political infrastructure within our own society that creates predators” (Pough 2005, 168). Each of the novels in the series uses art to highlight the pitfalls of excessive materialism. Each of the novels work as metaphors for the age-old fight between good and evil. However, by making Damali a young spoken word artist, Banks is making a huge statement about the power at hand for young women, the power to change the world. And as for hip-hop, she hasn’t given up hope. Banks notes, “I see plenty of room for Hip-hop as an awesome catalyst, and I’m not so ready to give up on all Hip-hop artists, their messages, or their lyrics. I think what has happened, as metaphorically alluded to in the novels, is that vampires have infiltrated the genre of music, have co-opted the culture, and have twisted it. But there are still some very young, savvy, ready-to-stand-for-their-beliefs young folk out there. . . . that’s the message, that’s my hope. . . . guess it’s really my prayer” (Pough 2005, 171). Like Black Artemis, L. A. Banks has a mission in her art, and that mission is in line with many of the goals that hip-hop feminists have set out. Their novels offer hope and a spark for hiphop culture, at least in terms of having a political mission aimed at change. Race, class, sex, gender, and the intersections of these are present in this new fiction in startling, surprising, and uplifting ways. Writers like L. A. Banks and Black Artemis, rappers like Jean Grae, and the hip-hop feminists that I have mentioned here can in varying degrees be seen as pushing the hip-hop feminist agenda forward. They represent—along with the video vixens and the women hip-hop heads who buy the music and support the culture—a small sampling of women in contemporary hip-hop culture. Together their stories offer versions of the truth that Joan Morgan suggests we could achieve. Together they also give us a glimpse at the possibility for change and a sign that hip-hop feminism just might be on the right path to what it is going to be at last. And then we might be a little less concerned with “what it do” because we would be so awed by all that the movement has done
Endnotes
1. I realize that the word “shorty” as a term that is often used to refer to women in hiphop culture and rap music is problematic. Although not as derogatory as some other terms, such as “chickenheads,” “bitch,” “ho,” and so forth, it is still a term that more often than not objectifies women. It is also a term in hip-hop culture that refers to younger people, often children. Because “shorty” is used within the culture to refer to women and children,  it can be argued that the term therefore infantilizes women; thus, it is not a term I use lightly. I use “shorty” throughout this essay because of its multiple meanings, because it showcases just how fraught the relationship between hip-hop and feminism is. And I also use it because it calls forth the generational issues between hip-hop feminists and older black feminism. In a sense, hip-hop feminists are the shorties, the next generation of feminists on the “come up” ready to continue the legacy of black women’s intellectual traditions and activism
2. Most of my information about the dreams and aspirations of video models and how much they make comes from a survey of the interviews and photo spreads I’ve read of in the Source Magazine’s monthly “Dime Piece” section and XXL’s monthly “Eye Candy” section. Each month these magazines pick a video girl to highlight. And while most of the “coverage” is the photo shoot of the scantly-clad woman, there is usually a two- to three-page write-up and interview of each girl. And it is in these limited spaces that we get their voices, hopes, and dreams

                                           Manuscripts of 1844
                                                  KARL MARX
      Soon after moving to Paris in November, 1843, Marx applied himself to the criticism of political economy-the new phase of his critical program foreshadowed in his two essays in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher. Between April and August of 1844 he produced the rough draft of what, judging by his preface, Was to have been a book. He did not finish it for publication, however, and it lay unpublished for more than eighty years. The surviving parts, comprising four manuscripts, were given the name shown above. An incomplete version in Russian translation was published in Moscow in 1927. The first full edition in German, prepared by D. Riazanov of the Marx•Engels Institute in Moscow, was published in Berlin in 1932, in Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Historisch-kritische Gesamtausgabe.
      The fundamentals of the Marxist interpretation of history are to be found in the 1844 manuscripts, including the notion of the proletarian revolution and future communism as the goal of the historical process. The theory is set forth, however, in terms of philosophical concepts drawn by Marx from Hegel and Feuerbach, most notably the concept of man's ""self-alienation"" or ""self-estrangement."" History, particularly under modern capitalism, is seen as a story of man's alienation in his life as producer, and communism is presented as the final transcendence of alienation via a revolution against private property. Because the 1844 manuscripts show us Marxism at the moment of its genesis in Marx's mind and because they help to clarify both the relation of Marxism to earlier German philosophy and its ethical significance, their publication has profoundly affected schoolarship on Marx and Marxism in our time.
      A part of the manuscripts consists largely of excerpts from writings of the political economists on such topics as wages of labor, profit of capital, and rent of land. The material reprinted here, comprising the extant portions in which Marx expounds his own position, consists of the preface and the sections entitled ""Estranged Labour,"" ""Private Property and Communism,"" ""The Meaning of Human Requirements,"" ""The Power of Money in Bourgeois Society,"" and ""Critique of the Hegelian Dialectic and Philosophy as a Whole.""
      A number of passages in the manuscripts have been crossed out, apparently by Marx. There is no reason to think that the passages crossed out had ceased to represent what Marx thought. He may well have been guided by editorial considerations in working over the draft of a manuscript originally intended for publication.*
                                                Preface
      I have already given notice in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher of the critique of jurisprudence and political science in the form of a critique of the Hegelian Philosophy of Right. In the course of elaboration for publication, the intermingling of criticism directed only against speculation with criticism of the various subjects themselves proved utterly unsuitable, hampering the development of the argument and rendering comprehension difficult. Moreover the wealth and diversity of the subjects to be treated, could have been compressed into one work only in a purely aphoristic style; whilst an aphoristic presentation of this kind, for its part, would have given the impression of arbitrary systematizing. I shall therefore issue the critique of law, ethics, politics, etc., in a series of distinct, independent pamphlets, and at the end try in a special work to present them again as a connected whole showing the interrelationship of the separate parts, and finally, shall make a critique of the speculative elaboration of that material. For this reason it will be found that the interconnection between political economy and the state, law, ethics, civil life, etc., is touched on in the present work only to the extent to which political economy itself ex professo1 touches on these subjects.
      It is hardly necessary to assure the reader conversant with political economy that my results have been won by means of a wholly empirical analysis based on a conscientious critical study of political economy.
      [Whereas the uninformed reviewer who ""tries to hide his complete ignorance and intellectual poverty by hurling the ""utopian phrase"" at the positive critic's head, or again such phrases as ""pure, resolute, utterly critical criticism,"" the ""not merely legal but social-utterly social-society,"" the ""compact, massy mass,"" the ""oratorical orators of the massy mass,""2 this reviewer has yet to fur"" nish the first proof that besides his theological family-affairs he has anything to contribute to a discussion of worldly matters.
      It goes without saying that besides the French and English Socialists I have made use of German socialist works as well. The only original German works of substance in this science, however-other than Weitling's writings-are the essays by Hess published in Einundzwanzig Bogen,4 and Engels Umrisse ZlL einer Kritik der Nationalokonomie5 in the Deutsch-Franzosische Jahrbucher where, likewise, I indicated in a very general way the basic elements of this work.
      
     It is only with Feuerbach that positive, humanistic and naturalistic criticism begins. The less noise they make, the more certain, profound, widespread and enduring is the effect of Feuerbach's writings, the only writings since Hegel's Phanomenologie and Logik to contain a real theoretical revolution.
     In contrast to the critical theologians9 of our day, I have deemed the concluding chapter of the present work-the settling of accounts with Hegelian dialectic and Hegelian philosophy as a whole-to be absolutely necessary, a task not yet performed. This lack of thoroughness is not accidental, since even the critical theologian remains a theologian. Hence, either he had to start from certain presuppositions of. philosophy accepted as authoritative; or if in the process of criticism and as a result of other people's discoveries doubts about these philosophical presuppositions have arisen in him, he abandons them without vindication and in a cowardly fashion, abstracts from them showing his servile dependence on these presuppositions and his resentment at this dependence merely in a negative, unconscious and sophistical manner.

     On close inspection theological criticism-genuinely progressive though it was at the inception of the movement-is seen in the final analysis to be nothing but the culmination and consequence of the old philosophical, and especially the Hegelian, transcendentalism, twisted into a theological caricature. This interesting example of the justice in history, which now assigns to theology, ever philosophy's spot of infection, the further role of portraying in itself the negative dissolution of philosophy-i.e., the process of its decay-this historical nemesis I shall demonstrate on another occasion.
      
                                              Estranged Labour3
      We have proceeded from the premises of political economy. We have accepted its language and its laws. We presupposed private property, the separation of labour, capital and land, and of wages, profit of capital and rent of land-likewise division of labour, competition, the concept of exchange-value, etc. On the basis of political economy itself, in its own words, we have shown that the worker sinks to the level of a commodity and becomes indeed the  most wretched of commodities; that the wretchedness of the worker is in inverse proportion to the power and magnitude of his production; that the necessary result of competition is the accumu¬lation of capital in a few hands, and thus the restoration of monopoly in a more terrible form; that finally the distinction between capitalist and land-rentier, like that between the tiller of the soil and the factory-worker, disappears and that the whole of society must I fall apart into the two classes-the property-owners and the propertyless workers.
     Political economy proceeds from the fact of private property, but it does not explain it to us. It expresses in general, abstract formulae the material process through which private property actually passes, and these formulae it then takes for laws. It does not comprehend these laws-i.e., it does not demonstrate how they arise from the very nature of private property. Political economy does not disclose the source of the division between labour and capital, and between capital and land. When, for example, it defines the relationship of wages to profit, it takes the interest of the capitalists to be the ultimate cause; i.e., it takes for granted what it is supposed to evolve. Similarly, competition comes in everywhere. It is explained from external circumstances. As to how far these external and apparently fortuitous circumstances are but the expression of a necessary course of development, political economy teaches us nothing. We have seen how, to it, exchange itself appears to be afortuitous fact. The only wheels which political economy sets in  motion are avarice and the war amongst the avaricious competition.
     Precisely because political economy does not grasp the connections within the movement, it was possible to counterpose, for instance, the doctrine of competition to the doctrine of monopoly, the doctrine of craft-liberty to the doctrine of the corporation, the doctrine of the division of landed property to the doctrine of the big estate-for competition, craft-liberty and the division of landed property were explained and comprehended only as fortuitous, premeditated and violent consequences of monopoly, the corporation; and feudal property, not as their necessary, inevitable and natural consequences.
      Now, therefore, we have to grasp the essential connection between private property, avarice, and the separation of labour, capital and landed property; between exchange and competition, value and the devaluation of men, monopoly and competition, etc.; the connection between this whole estrangement and the money system.
     Do not let us go back to a fictitious primordial condition as the political economist does, when he tries to explain. Such a primor dial condition explains nothing. He merely pushes the question away into a grey nebulous distance. He assumes in the form of fact, of an event, what he is supposed to deduce-namely, the necessary relationship between two things-between, for example, division of labour and exchange. Theology in the same way explains the origin of evil by the fall of man: that is, it assumes as a fact, in historical form, what has to be explained.
     We proceed from an actual economic fact.
     The worker becomes all the poorer the more wealth he produces, the more his production increases in power and range. The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates. With the increasing value of the world of things proceeds in direct proportion the devaluation of the world of men. Labour produces not only commodities; it produces itself and the worker as a commodity-and does so in the proportion in which it produces commodities generally.
     This fact expresses merely that the object which labour produces-labour's product-confronts it as something alien, as a power independent of the producer. The product of labour is labour which has been congealed in an object, which has become material: it is the objectification of labour. Labour's realization is its objectification. In the conditions dealt with by political economy this realization of labour appears as loss of reality for the workers; objectification as loss of the object and object-bondage; appropriation as estrangement, as alienation.4
     So much does labour's realization appear as loss of reality that the worker loses reality to the point of starving to death. So much does objectification appear as loss of the object that the worker is robbed of the objects most necessary not only for his life but for his work. Indeed, labour itself becomes an object which he can get hold of only with the greatest effort and with the most irregular interruptions. So much does the appropriation of the object appear as estrangement that the more objects the worker produces the fewer can he possess and the more he falls under the dominion of his product, capital.
     All these consequences are contained in the definition that the worker is related to the product of his labour as to an alien object. For on this premise it is clear that the more the worker spends himself, the more powerful the alien objective world becomes which he creates over-against himself, the poorer he himself-his inner world-becomes, the less belongs to him as his own. It is the same in religion. The more man puts into God, the less he retains in himself. The worker puts his life into the object; but now his life no longer belongs to him but to the object. Hence, the greater this activity, the greater is the worker's lack of objects. Whatever the product of his labour is, he is not. Therefore the greater this product, the less is he himself. The alienation of the worker in his product means not only that his labour becomes an object, an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently, as something alien to him, and that it becomes a power of its own confronting him; it means that the life which he has conferred on the object confronts him as something hostile and alien.
     Let us now look more closely at the objectification, at the production of the worker; and therein at the estrangement, the loss of the object, his product.
     The worker can create nothing without nature, without the sensuous external world. It is the material on which his labor is manifested, in which it is active, from which and by means of which it produces.
     But just as nature provides labor with the means of life in the sense that labour cannot live without objects on which to operate, on the other hand, it also provides the means of life in the more restricted sense-i.e., the means for the physical subsistence of the worker himself.
     Thus the more the worker by his labour appropriates the external world, sensuous nature, the more he deprives himself of means of life in the double respect: first, that the sensuous external world more and more ceases to be an object belonging to his labour-to be his labour's means of life; and secondly, that it more and more ceases to be means of life in the immediate sense, means for the physical subsistence of the worker.
     Thus in this double respect the worker becomes a slave of his object, first, in that he receives an object of labour, i.e., in that he receives work; and secondly, in that he receives means of subsistence. Therefore, it enables him to exist, first, as a worker; and, second, as a physical subject. The extremity of this bondage is that it is only as a worker that he continues to maintain himself as a physical subject, and that it is only as a physical subject that he is a worker.
      (The laws of political economy express the estrangement of the worker in his object thus: the more the worker produces, the less he has to consume; the more values he creates, the more valueless, the more unworthy he becomes; the better formed his product, the more deformed becomes the worker; the more civilized his object, the more barbarous becomes the worker; the mightier labour becomes, the more powerless becomes the worker; the more ingenious labour becomes, the duller becomes the worker and the more he becomes nature's bondsman.)
     Political economy conceals the estrangement inherent in the nature of labour by not considering the direct relationship between the worker (labour) and production. It is true that labour produces for the rich wonderful things-but for the worker it produces privation. It produces palaces-but for the worker, hovels. It produces beauty-but for the worker, deformity. It replaces labour by machines-but some of the workers it throws back to a barbarous type of labour, and the other workers it turns into machines. It produces intelligence-but for the worker idiocy, cretinism.
     The direct relationship of labour to its produce is the relationship of the worker to the objects of his production. The relationship of the man of means to the objects of production and to production itself is only a consequence of this first relationship-mid confirms it. We shall consider this other aspect later.
     When we ask, then, what is the essential relationship of labour we are asking about the relationship of the worker to production.
     Till now we have been considering the estrangement, the alienation of the worker only in one of its aspects, i.e., the worker's relationship to the products of his labour. But the estrangement is manifested not only in the result but in the act of production¬within the producing activity itself. How would the worker come to face the product of his activity as a stranger, were it not that in the very act of production he was estranging himself from himself? The product is after all but the summary of the activity of production.
If then the product of labour is alienation, production itself must be active alienation, the alienation of activity, the activity of alienation. In the estrangement of the object of labour is merely summarized the estrangement, the alienation, in the activity of labour itself.
      What, then, constitutes the alienation of labour?
      First, the fact that labour is external to the worker, i.e., it does not belong to his essential being; that in his work, therefore, he does not affirm himself but denies himself, does not feel content but unhappy, does not develop freely his physical and mental energy but mortifies his body and ruins his mind. The worker therefore only feels himself outside his work, and in his work feels outside himself. He is at home when he is not working, and when he is working he is not at home. His labour is therefore not voluntary, but coerced; it is forced labour. It is therefore not the satisfaction of a need; it is merely a means to satisfy needs external to it. Its alien character emerges clearly in the fact that as soon as no physical or other compulsion exists, labour is shunned like the plague. External labour, labour in which man alienates himself, is a labour of self-sacrifice, of mortification. Lastly, the external character of labour for the worker appears in the fact that it is not his own, but someone else's, that it does not belong to him, that in it he belongs, not to himself, but to another. Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the human imagination, of the human brain and the human heart, operates independently of the individual-that is, operates on him as an alien, divine or diabolical activity-in the same way the worker's activity is not his spontaneous activity. It belongs to another; it is the loss of his self.
    As a result. therefore, man (the worker) no longer feels himself to be freely active in any but his animal functions-eating, drinking, procreating, or at most in his dwelling and in dressing-up, etc.; and in his human functions he no longer feels himself to be anything but an animal. What is animal becomes human and what is human becomes animal.
    Certainly eating, drinking, procreating, etc., are also genuinely human functions. But in the abstraction which separates them from the sphere of all other human activity and turns them into sole and ultimate ends, they are animal.
      We have considered the act of estranging practical human activity, labour, in two of its aspects. (1) The relation of the worker to the product of labour as an alien object exercising power over him. This relation is at the same time the relation to the sensuous external world, to the objects of nature as an alien world antagonistically opposed to him. (2) The relation of labour to the act of production within the labour process. This relation is the relation of theworker to his own activity as an alien activity not belonging to him; it is activity as suffering, strength as weakness, begetting as emasculating, the worker's own physical and mental energy, his personal life or what is life other than activity-as an activity which is turned against him, neither depends on nor belongs to him. Here we have self-estrangement, as we had previously the estrangement of the thing.
     We have yet a third aspect of estranged labour to deduce from the two already considered.
     Man is a species being, not only because in practice and in theory he adopts the species as his object (his own as well as those of other things), but-and this is only another way of expressing it-but also because he treats himself as the actual, living species; because he treats himself as a universal and therefore a free being.
     The life of the species, both in man and in animals, consists physically in the fact that man (like the animal) lives on inorganic nature; and the more universal man is compared with an animal, the more universal is the sphere of inorganic nature on which he lives. Just as plants, animals, stones, the air, light, etc., constitute a part of human consciousness in the realm of theory, partly as objects of natural science, partly as objects of art-his spiritual inorganic nature, spiritual nourishment which he must first prepare to make it palatable and digestible-so too in the realm of practice they constitute a part of human life and human activity. Physically man lives only on these products of nature, whether they appear in the form of food, heating, clothes, a dwelling, or whatever it may be. The universality of man is in practice manifested precisely in the universality which makes all nature his inorganic body-both inasmuch as nature is (1) his direct means of life, and (2) the material, the object, and the instrument of his life-activity. Nature is man's inorganic body-nature, that is, in so far as it is not itself the human body. Man lives on nature-means that nature is his body, with which he must remain in continuous intercourse if he is not to die. That man's physical and spiritual life is linked to nature means simply that nature is linked to itself, for man is a part of nature.
     In estranging from man (1) nature, and (2) himself, his own active functions, his life-activity, estranged labour estranges the species from man. It turns for him the life of the species into a means of individual life. First it estranges the life of the species and individual life, and secondly it makes individual life in its abstract form the purpose of the life of the species, likewise in its abstract and estranged form.
     For in the first place labour, life-activity, productive life itself, appears to man merely as a means of satisfying a need-the need to maintain the physical existence. Yet the productive life is the life of the species. It is life-engendering life. The whole character of a species-its species character-is contained in the character of its life-activity; and free, conscious activity is man's species character. Life itself appears only as a means to life.
      The animal is immediately identical with its life-activity. It does not distinguish itself from it. It is its life-activity. Man makes his life-activity itself the object of his will and of his consciousness. He has conscious life-activity. It is not a determination with which he directly merges. Conscious life-activity directly distinguishes man from animal life-activity. It is just because of this that he is a species being. Or it is only because he is a species being that he is a Conscious Being, i.e., that his own life is an object for him. Only because of that is his activity free activity. Estranged labour reverses this relationship, so that it is just because man is a conscious being that he makes his life-activity, his essential being, a mere means to his existence.
     In creating an objective world by his practical activity, in working-up inorganic nature, man proves himself a conscious species being, i.e., as a being that treats the species as its own essential being, or that treats itself as a species being. Admittedly animals also produce. They build themselves nests, dwellings, like the bees, beavers, ants, etc. But an animal only produces what it immediately needs for itself or its young. It produces one-sidedly, whilst man produces universally. It produces. only under the dominion of immediate physical need, whilst man produces even when he is free from physical need and only truly produces in freedom therefrom. An animal produces only itself, whilst man reproduces the whole of nature. An animal's product belongs immediately to its physical body, whilst man freely confronts his product. An animal forms things in accordance with the standard and the need of the species to which it belongs, whilst man knows how to produce in accordance with the standard of every species, and knows how to apply everywhere the inherent standard to the object. Man therefore also forms things in accordance with the laws of beauty.
     It is just in the working-up of the objective world, therefore, that man first really proves himself to be a species being. This production is his active species life. Through and because of this production, nature appears as his work and his reality. The object of la bour is, therefore, the objectification of man's species life: for he duplicates himself not only, as in consciousness, intellectually, but also actively, in reality, and therefore he contemplates himself in a world that he has created. In tearing away from man the object of his production, therefore, estranged labour tears from him his species life, his real species objectivity, and transforms his advantage over animals into the disadvantage that his inorganic body, nature, is taken from him.
     Similarly, in degrading spontaneous activity, free activity, to a means, estranged labour makes man's species life a means to his physical existence.
     The consciousness which man has of his species is thus transformed by estrangement in such a way that the species life becomes for him a means.
     Estranged labour turns thus:
      (3) Man's species being, both nature and his spiritual species property, into a being alien to him, into a means to his individual existence. It estranges man's own body from him, as it does external nature and his spiritual essence, his human being.
      (4) An immediate consequence of the fact that man is estranged from the product of his labour, from his life-activity, from his species being is the estrangement of man from man. If a man is confronted by himself, he is confronted by the other man. ""What applies to a man's relation to his work, to the product of his labour and to himself, also holds of a man's relation to the other man, and to the other man's labour and object of labour.
     In fact, the proposition that man's species nature is estranged from him means that one man is estranged from the other, as each of them is from man's essential nature.5
     The estrangement of man, and in fact every relationship in which man stands to himself, is first realized and expressed in the relationship in which a man stands to other men.
     Hence within the relationship of estranged labour each man views the other in accordance with the standard and the position in which he finds himself as a worker.
     We took our departure from a fact of political economy-the estrangement of the worker and his production. We have formulated the concept of this fact-estranged, alienated labour. We have analysed this concept-hence analysing merely a fact of political economy.
      Let us now see, further, how in real life the concept of estranged, alienated labour must express and present itself. If the product of labour is alien to me, if it confronts me as an alien power, to whom, then, does it belong?
     If my own activity does not belong to me, if it is an alien, a coerced activity, to whom, then, does it belong?
     To a being other than me.
     Who is this being?
     The gods? To be sure, in the earliest times the principal production (for example, the building of temples, etc., in Egypt, India and Mexico) appears to be in the service of the gods, and the product belongs to the gods. However, the gods on their own were never the lords of labour. No more was nature. And what a contradiction it would be if, the more man subjugated nature by his labour and the more the miracles of the gods were rendered superfluous by the miracles of industry, the more man were to renounce the joy of production and the enjoyment of the produce in favour of these powers.
     The alien being, to whom labour and the produce of labour belongs, in whose service labour is done and for whose benefit the produce of labour is provided, can only be man himself.
     If the product of labour does not belong to the worker, if it confronts him as an alien power, this can only be because it belongs to some other man than the worker. If the worker's activity is a torment to him, to another it must be delight and his life's joy. Not the gods, not nature, but only man himself can be this alien power over man.
     We must bear in mind the above-stated proposition that man's relation to himself only becomes objective and real for him through his relation to the other man. Thus, if the product of his labour, his labour objectified, is for him an alien, hostile, powerful object independent of him, then his position towards it is such that someone else is master of this object, someone who is alien, hostile, powerful, and independent of him. If his own activity is to him an unfree activity, then he is treating it as activity performed in the service, under the dominion, the coercion and the yoke of another man.
      Every self-estrangement of man from himself and from nature appears in the relation in which he places himself and nature to men other than and differentiated from himself. For this reason religious self-estrangement necessarily appears in the relationship of the layman to the priest, or again to a mediator, etc., since we are here dealing with the intellectual world. In the real practical world self-estrangement can only become manifest through 'the real practical relationship to other men. The medium through which estrangement takes place is itself practical. Thus through estranged labour man not only engenders his relationship to the object and to the act of production as to powers that are alien and hostile to him; he also engenders the relationship in which other men stand to his production and to his product, and the relationship in which he stands to these other men. Just as he begets his own production as the, loss of his reality, as his punishment; just as he begets his own product as a loss, as a product not belonging to him; so he begets the dominion of the one who does not produce over production and over the product. Just as he estranges from himself his own activity, so he confers to the stranger activity which is not his own.
     Till now we have only considered this relationship from the standpoint of the worker and later we shall be considering it also from the standpoint of the non-worker.
     Through estranged, alienated labour, then, the worker produces the relationship to this labour of a man alien to labour and standing outside it. The relationship of the worker to labour engenders the relation to it of the capitalist, or whatever one chooses to call the master of labour. Private property is thus the product, the result, the necessary consequence, of alienated labour, of the external relation of the worker to nature and to himself.
     Private property thus results by analysis from the concept of alienated labour-i.e., of alienated man, of estranged labour, of estranged life, of. estranged man.
     True, it is as a result of the movement of private property  that we have obtained the concept of alienated labour (of alienated life) from political economy. But on analysis of this concept it becomes clear that though private property appears to be the source, the cause of alienated labour, it is really its consequence, just as the gods in the beginning are not the cause but the effect of man's intellectual confusion. Later this relationship becomes reciprocal.
     Only at the very culmination of the development of private property does this, its secret, re-emerge, namely, that on the one hand it is the product of alienated labour, and that secondly it is the means by which labour alienates itself, the realization of this alienation.
     This exposition immediately sheds light on various hitherto unsolved conflicts.
      (1) Political economy starts from labour as the real soul of production; yet to labour it gives nothing, and to private property everything. From this contradiction Proudhon has concluded in favour of labour and against private property. We understand, however, that this apparent contradiction is the contradiction of estranged labour with itself, and that political economy has merely formulated the laws of estranged labour.
     We also understand, therefore, that wages and private property are identical: where the product, the object of labour pays for labour itself, the wage is but a necessary consequence of labour's estrangement, for after all in the wage of labour, labour does not appear as an end in itself but as the servant of the wage. We shall develop this point later, and meanwhile will only deduce some conclusions.
     A forcing-up of wages (disregarding all other difficulties, including the fact that it would only be by force, too, that the higher wages, being an anomaly, could be maintained) would therefore be nothing but better payment for the slave, and would not conquer either for the worker or for labour their human status and dignity.
     Indeed, even the equality of wages demanded by Proudhon only transforms the relationship of the present-day worker to his labour into the relationship of all men to labour. Society is then conceived as an abstract capitalist.
     Wages are a direct consequence of estranged labour, and estranged labour is the direct cause of private property. The downfall of the one aspect must therefore mean the downfall of the other.
      (2) From the relationship of estranged labour to private property it further follows that the emancipation of society from private property, etc., from servitude, is expressed in the political form of the emancipation of the workers; not that their emancipation alone was at stake but because the emancipation of the workers contains universal human emancipation-and it contains this, because the whole of human servitude is involved in the relation of the worker to production, and every relation of servitude is but a modification and consequence of this relation.
     Just as we have found the concept of private property from the concept of estranged, alienated labour by analysis, in the same way every category of political economy can be evolved with the help of these two factors; and we shall find again in each category, e.g., trade, competition, capital, money, only a definite and developed expression of the first foundations.
     Before considering this configuration, however, let us try to solve two problems.
      (1) To define the general nature of private property, as it has arisen as a result of estranged labour, in its relation to truly human, social property.
      (2) We have accepted the estrangement of labour, its alienation, as a fact, and we have analysed this fact. How, we now ask, does man come to alienate, to estrange, his labour? How is this estrangement rooted in the nature of human development? We have already gone a long way to the solution of this problem by transforming the question as to the origin of private property into the question as to the relation of alienated labour to the course of humanity's development. For when one speaks of private property, one thinks of being concerned with something external to man. When one speaks of labour, one is directly concerned with man himself. This new formulation of the question already contains its solution.
      As to (1): The general nature of private property and its relation to truly human property.
      Alienated labour has resolved itself for us into two elements which mutually condition one another, or which are but different expressions of one and the same relationship. Appropriation appears as estrangement, as alienation; and alienation appears as appropriation, estrangement as true enfranchisement.
      We have considered the one side-alienated labour in relation to the worker himself, i.e., the relation of alienated labour to itself. The property-relation of the non-worker to the worker and to labour we have found as the product, the necessary outcome of this relation of alienated labour. Private property, as the material, summary expression of alienated labour, embraces both relations-the relation of the worker to work, to the product of his labour and to the non-worker, and the relation of the non-worker to the worker and to the product of his labor.
      Having seen that in relation to the worker who appropriates nature by means of his labour, this appropriation appears as estrangement, his own spontaneous activity as activity for another and as activity of another, vitality as a sacrifice of life, production of the object as loss of the object to an alien power, to an alien person-we shall now consider the relation to the worker, to labour and its object of this person who is alien to labour and the worker.
      First it has to be noticed, that everything which appears in the worker as an activity of alienation, of estrangement, appears in the non-wor ker as a state of alienation, of estrangement.
      Secondly, that the worker's real, practical attitude in production and to the product (as a state of mind ) appears in the non-worker confronting him as a theoretical attitude.
      Thirdly, the non-worker does everything against the worker which the worker does against himself; but he does not do against himself what he does against the worker.
      Let us look more closely at these three relations.6
                                 Private Property and Communism
      Re. p. XXXIX. The antithesis of propertylessness and property so long as it is not comprehended as the antithesis of labour and capital, still remains an antithesis of indifference, not grasped in its active connection, its internal relation-an antithesis not yet grasped as a contradiction. It can find expression in this first form even without the advanced development of private property ( as in ancient Rome, Turkey, etc.). It does not yet appear as having been established by private property itself. But labour, the subjective essence of private property as exclusion of property, and capital, objective labour as exclusion of labour, constitute private property as its developed state of contradiction-hence a dynamic relationship moving inexorably to its resolution.
     Re. the same page. The transcendence of self-estrangement follows the same course as self-estrangement. Private property is first considered only in its objective aspect-but nevertheless with labour as its essence. Its form of existence is therefore capital, which is to be annulled ""as such"" (Proudhon). Or a particular form of labour-labour levelled down, parcelled, and therefore unfree-is conceived as the source of private property's perniciousness and of its existence in estrangement from men; for instance, Fourier, who, like the physiocrats, also conceived agricultural labour to be at least the exemplary type, whilst Saint-Simon declares in contrast that industrial labour as such is the essence, and now also aspires to the exclusive rule of the industrialists and the improvement of the workers condition. Finally, communism is the positive expression of annulled private property-at first as universal private property. By embracing this relation as a whole, communism is:
      (1) In its first form only a generalization and consummation of this relationship. It shows itself as such in a two fold form: on the one hand, the dominion of material property bulks so large that it wants to destroy everything which is not capable of being possessed by all as private property. It wants to abstract by force from talent, etc. For it the sole purpose of life and existence is direct, physical possession. The category of labourer is not done away with, but extended to all men. The relationship of private property persists as the relationship of the community to the world of things. Finally, this movement of counter posing universal private property to private property finds expression in the bestial form of counter posing to marriage (certainly a form of exclusive private property) the community of women, in which a woman becomes a piece of communal and common property. It may be said that this idea of the community of women gives away the secret of this as yet completely crude and thoughtless communism. Just as the woman passes from marriage to general prostitution,7 so the entire world of wealth (that is, of man's objective substance) passes from the relationship of exclusive marriage with the owner of private property to a state of universal prostitution with the community. In negating the personality of man in every sphere, this type of communism is really nothing but the logical expression of private property, which is this negation. General envy constituting itself as a power is the disguise in which avarice re-establishes itself and satisfies itself, only in another way. The thoughts of every piece of private property-inherent in each piece as such-are at least turned against all wealthier private property in the form of envy and the urge to reduce to a common level, so that this envy and urge even constitute the essence of competition. The crude communism is only the consummation of this envy and of this levelling-down proceeding from the preconceived minimum. It has a definite, limited standard. How little this annulment of private property is really an appropriation is in fact proved by the abstract negation of the entire world of culture and civilization, the regression to the unnatural simplicity of the poor and undemanding man who has not only failed to go beyond private property, but has not yet even attained to it.
     The community is only a community of labour, and an equality of wages paid out by the communal capital-the community as the universal capitalist. Both sides of the relationship are raised to an imagined- universality-labour as a state in which every person is put, and capital as the acknowledged universality and power of the community.
     In the approach to woman as the spoil and handmaid of communal lust is expressed the infinite degradation in which man exists for himself, for the secret of this approach has its unambiguous, decisive, plain and undisguised expression in the relation of man to woman and in the manner in which the direct and natural procreative relationship is conceived. The direct, natural, and necessary relation of person to person is the relation of man to woman. In this natural relationship of the sexes man's relation to nature is immediately his relation to man, just as his relation to man is immediately his relation to nature-his own natural function. In this relationship, therefore, is sensuously manifested, reduced to an observable fact, the extent to which the human essence has become nature to man, or to which nature has to him become the human essence of man. From this relationship one can therefore judge man's whole level of development. It follows from the character of this relationship how much man as a species being, as man, has come to be himself and to comprehend himself; the relation of man to woman is the most natural relation of human being to human being. It therefore reveals the extent to which man's natural behaviour has become human, or the extent to which the human essence in him has become a natural essence-the extent to which his human nature has come to be nature to him. In this relationship is revealed, too, the extent to which man's need has hecome a human need; the extent to which, therefore, the other person as a person has become for him a need-the extent to which he in his individual existence is at the same time a social being. The first positive annulment of private property-crude communism-is thus merely one form in which the vileness of private property, which wants to set itself up as the positive community, comes to the surface.
      (2) Communism (a) of a political nature still-democratic or despotic; (b) with the annulment of the state, yet still incomplete, and being still affected by private property (i.e., by the estrangement of man). In both forms communism already knows itself to be re-integration or return of man to himself, the transcendence of human self-estrangement; but since it has not yet grasped the positive essence of private property, and just as little the human nature of need, it remains captive to it and infected by it. It has, indeed, grasped its concept, but not its essence.
      (3) Communism as the positive transcendence of private property, or human self-estrangement, and therefore as the real appropriation of the human essence by and for man; communism therefore as the complete return of man to himself as a social (i.e., human) being-a return become conscious, and accomplished within the entire wealth of previous development. This communism, as fully-developed naturalism, equals humanism, and as fully-developed humanism equals naturalism; it is the genuine resolution of the conflict between man and nature and between man and man-the true resolution of the strife between existence and essence, between objectification and self-confirmation, between freedom and necessity, between the individual and the species. Communism is the riddle of history solved, and it knows itself to be this solution.
     The entire movement of history is, therefore, both its actual act of genesis (the birth act of its empirical existence) and also for its thinking consciousness the comprehended and known process of its coming-to-be. That other, still immature communism, meanwhile, seeks an historical proof for itself-a proof in the realm of the existent-amongst disconnected historical phenomena opposed to private property, tearing single phases from the historical process and focussing attention on them as proofs of its historical pedigree (a horse ridden hard especially by Cabet, Villegardelle, etc.). By so doing it simply makes clear that by far the greater part of this proc¬ess contradicts its claims, and that, if it has once been, precisely its being in the past refutes its pretension to being essential.
     That the entire revolutionary movement necessarily finds both its empirical and its theoretical basis in the movement of private property-in that of the economy, to be precise-is easy to see.
     This material, immediately sensuous private property is the material sensuous expression of estranged human life. Its movement production and consumption-is the sensuous revelation of the movement of all production hitherto-i.e., the realization or the reality of man. Religion, family, state, law, morality, science, art, etc., are only particular modes of production, and fall under its general law. The positive transcendence of private property as the appropriation of human life is, therefore, the positive transcendence of all estrangement-that is to say, the return of man from religion, family, state, etc., to this human, i.e., social made of existence. Religious estrangement as such occurs only in the realm of consciousness, of man's inner life, but economic estrangement is that of real life; its transcendence therefore embraces bath aspects. It is evident that the initial stage of the movement amongst the various peoples depends an whether the true and for them authentic life of the people manifests itself more in consciousness or in the external world-is mare ideal or real. Communism begins from the outset (Owen) with atheism; but atheism is at first far from being communism; indeed, it is still mostly an abstraction.
     The philanthropy of atheism is therefore at first only philosophical, abstract, philanthropy, and that of communism is at once real and directly bent an action.
     We have seen haw an the premise of positively annulled private property man produces man-himself and the other man; haw the object, being the direct embodiment of his individuality, is simultaneously his awn existence far the other man, the existence of the other man, and that existence far him. Likewise, however, bath the material of labour and man as the subject, are the paint of departure as well as the result of the movement (and precisely in this fact, that they must constitute the point of departure, lies the historical necessity of private property). Thus the social character is the general character of the whale movement: just as society itself produces man as man, So is society produced by him. Activity and consumption, bath in their content and in their mode of existence, are social: social activity and social consumption; the human essence of nature first exists only far social man; for only here does nature exist far him as a bond with man-as his existence for the other and the other's existence for him-as the life-element of the human world; only here does nature exist as the foundation of his own human existence. Only here has what is to him his natural existence became his human existence, and nature became man for him. Thus society is the consummated oneness in substance of man and nature-the true resurrection of nature-the naturalism of man and the humanism of nature bath brought to fulfilment.
     Social activity and social consumption exist by no means only in the farm of same directly communal activity and directly communal consumption, although communal activity and communal consumption-i.e., activity and consumption which are manifested and directly confirmed in real association with other men-will occur wherever such a direct expression of sociality stems from the true character of the activity's content and is adequate to the nature of consumption.
     But again when I am active scientifically, etc.,-when I am engaged in activity which I can seldom perform in direct community with others-then I am social, because I am active as a man. Not only is the material of my activity given to me as a social product (as is even the language in which the thinker is active): my own, existence is social activity, and therefore that which I make of myself, I make of myself for society and with the consciousness of myself as a social being.
     My general consciousness is only the theoretical shape of that of which the living shape is the real community, the social fabric, although at the present day general consciousness is an abstraction from real life and as such antagonistically confronts it. Consequently, too, the activity of my general consciousness, as an activity, is my theoretical existence as a social being.
     What is to be avoided above all is the re-establishing of ""Society"" as an abstraction vis-à-vis the individual. The individual is the social being. His life, even if it may not appear in the direct form of a communal life carried out together with others-is therefore an expression and confirmation of social life. Man's individual and species life are not different, however much-and this is inevitable-the mode of existence of the individual is a more particular, or more general mode of the life of the species, or the life of the species is a more particular or more general individual life.
     In his consciousness of species man confirms his real social life and simply repeats his real existence in thought, just as conversely the being of the species confirms itself in species-consciousness and is for itself in its generality as a thinking being.
     Man, much as he may therefore be a particular individual (and it is precisely his particularity which makes him an individual, and a real individual social being) , is just as much the totality-the ideal totality-the subjective existence of thought and experienced society present for itself; just as he exists also in the real world as the awareness and the real enjoyment of social existence, and as a totality of human life-activity.
     Thinking and being are thus no doubt distinct, but at the same time they are in unity with each other.
     Death seems to be a harsh victory of the species over the definite individual and to contradict their unity. But the determinate individual is only a determinate species being, and as such mortal.
      (4) Just as private property is only the sensuous expression of the fact that man becomes objective for himself and at the same time becomes to himself a strange and inhuman object; just as it expresses the fact that the assertion of his life is the alienation of his life, that his realization is his loss of reality, is an alien reality: conversely, the positive transcendence of private property-i.e., the sensuous appropriation for and by man of the human essence and of human life, of objective man, of human achievements-is not to be conceived merely in the sense of direct, one-sided gratification-merely in the sense of possessing, of having. Man appropriates his total essence in a total manner, that is to say, as a whole man. Each of his human relations to the world-seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, feeling, thinking, being aware, sensing, wanting, acting, loving-in short, all the organs of his individual being, like those organs which are directly social in their form, are in their objective orientation or in their orientation to the object, the appropriation of that object, the appropriation of the human world; their orientation to the object is the manifestation of the human world;8 it is human efficaciousness and human suffering, for suffering, apprehended humanly, is an enjoyment of self in man.
     Private property has made us so stupid and one-sided that an object is only ours when we have it-when it exists for us as capital, or when it is directly possessed, eaten, drunk, worn, inhabited, etc.,-in short, when it is used by us. Although private property itself again conceives all these direct realizations of possession as means of life, and the life which they serve as means is the life of private property-labour and conversion into capital.
     In place of all these physical and mental senses there has therefore come the sheer estrangement of all these senses-the sense of having. The human being had to be reduced to this absolute poverty in order that he might yield his inner wealth to the outer world. ( On the category of ""having,"" see Hess in the Twenty-One Sheets. )
     The transcendence of private property is therefore the complete emancipation of all human senses and attributes; but it is this emancipation precisely because these senses and attributes have become, subjectively and objectively, human. The eye has become a human eye, just as its object has become a social, human object-an object emanating from man for man. The senses have therefore become directly in their practice theoreticians. They relate themselves to the thing for the sake of the thing, but the thing itself is an objective human relation to itself and to man,9and vice versa. Need or enjoyment have consequently lost their egotistical nature, and nature has lost its mere utility by use becoming human use.
     In the same way, the senses and enjoyments of other men have become my own appropriation. Besides these direct organs, therefore, social organs develop in the form of society; thus, for instance, activity in direct association with others, etc., has become an organ for expressing my own life, and a mode of appropriating human life.
     It is obvious that the human eye gratifies itself in a way different from the crude, non•human eye; the human ear different from the crude ear, etc.
     To recapitulate; man is not lost in his object only when the object becomes for him a human object or objective man. This is possible only when the object becomes for him a social object, he himself for himself a social being, just as society becomes a being for him in this object.
     On the one hand, therefore, it is only when the objective world becomes everywhere for man in society the world of man's essential powers1-human reality, and for that reason the reality of his own essential powers-that all objects become for him the objectification of himself, become objects which confirm and realize his individuality, become his objects: that is, man himself becomes the object. The manner in which they become his depends on the nature of the objects and on the nature of the essential power corresponding to it; for it is precisely the determinateness of this relationship which shapes the particular, real mode of affirmation. To the eye an object comes to be other than it is to the ear, and the object of the eye is another object than the object of the ear. The peculiarity of each essential power is precisely its peculiar essence, and therefore also the peculiar mode of its objectification, of its objectively actual living being. Thus man is affirmed in the objective world not only in the act of thinking, but with all his senses.
     On the other hand, looking at this in its subjective aspect: just as music alone awakens in man the sense of music, and just as the most beautiful music has no sense for the unmusical ear-is no object for it, because my object can only be the confirmation of one of my essential powers and can therefore only be so for me as my essential power is present for itself as a subjective capacity, because the sense of an object for me goes only so far as my senses go (has only sense for a sense corresponding to that object) -for this reason the senses of the social man are other senses than those of the non-social man. Only through the objectively unfolded richness of man's essential being is the richness of subjective human sensibility (a musical ear, an eye for beauty of form-in short, senses capable of human gratifications, senses confirming themselves as essential powers of man ) either cultivated or brought into being. For not only the five senses but also the so-called mental senses-the practical senses (will, love, etc. )-in a word, human sense-the humanness of the senses-comes to be by virtue of its object, by virtue of humanized nature. The forming of the five senses is a labour of the entire history of the world down to the present.
     The sense caught up in crude practical need has only a restricted sense. For the starving man, it is not the human form of food that exists, but only its abstract being as food; •it could just as well be there in its crudest form, and it would be impossible to say wherein this feeding-activity differs from that of animals. The care-burdened man in need has no sense for the finest play; the dealer in minerals sees only the mercantile value but not the beauty and the unique nature of the mineral: he has no mineralogical sense. Thus, the objectification of the human essence both in its theoretical and practical aspects is required to make man's sense human, as well as to create the human sense corresponding to the entire wealth of human and natural substance.
     Just as resulting from the movement of private property, of its wealth as well as its poverty-or of its material and spiritual wealth and poverty-the budding society finds to hand all the material for this development: so established society produces man in this entire richness of his being-produces the rich man profoundly endowed with all the senses-as its enduring reality.
     It will be seen how subjectivism and objectivism, spiritualism and materialism, activity and suffering, only lose their antithetical character, and thus their existence, as such antitheses in the social condition; it will be seen how the resolution of the theoretical antitheses is only possible  way, by virtue of the practical energy of men . Their resolution is therefore by no means merely, a problem of knowledge, but a real problem of life, which philosophy could not solve precisely because it conceived this problem as merely a theoretical one.
     It will be seen how the history of industry and the established objective existence of industry are the open book of man's essential powers, the exposure to the senses of human psychology. Hitherto this was not conceived in its inseparable connection with man's essential being, but only in an external relation of utility, because, moving in the realm of estrangement, people could only think man's general mode of being-religion or history in its abstract general character as politics, art, literature, etc.,-to be the realityof man's essential powers and man's species-activity. We have before us the objectified essential powers of man in the form of sensuous, alien, useful objects, in the form of estrangement, displayed in ordinary material industry (which can be conceived as a part of that general movement, just as that movement can be conceived as a particular part of industry, since all human activity hitherto has been labour-that is, industry-activity estranged from itself).
     A psychology for which this, the part of history most contemporary and accessible to sense, remains a closed book, cannot become a genuine, comprehensive and real science. What indeed are we to think of a science which airily abstracts from this large part of human labour and which fails to feel its own incompleteness, while such a wealth of human endeavour unfolded before it means nothing more to it than, perhaps, what can be expressed in one word-""need, "" ""vulgar need""?
     The natural sciences have developed an enormous activity and have accumulated a constantly growing mass of material. Philosophy, however, has remained just as alien to them as they remain to philosophy. Their momentary unity was only a chimerical illusion. The will was there, but the means were lacking. Even historiography pays regard to natural science only occasionally, as a factor of enlightenment and utility arising from individual great discoveries. But natural science has invaded and transformed human life all the more practically through the medium of industry; and has prepared human emancipation, however directly and much it had to consummate dehumanization. Industry is the actual, historical relation of nature, and therefore of natural science, to man. If, therefore, industry is conceived as the exoteric revelation of man's essential powers, we also gain an understanding of the human essence of nature or the natural essence of man. In consequence, natural science will lose its abstractly material-or rather, its idealistictendency, and will become the basis of human science, as it has already become the basis of actual human life, albeit in an estranged form. One basis for life and another basis for science is a priori a lie. The nature which comes to be in human history-the genesis of human society-is man's real nature; hence nature as it comes to be through industry, even though in an estranged form, is true anthropological nature.
     Sense-perception ( see Feuerbach) must be the basis of all science. Only when it proceeds from sense-perception in the twofold form both of sensuous consciousness and of sensuous need-that is, only when science proceeds from nature-is it true science. All history is the preparation for ""man"" to become the object of sensuous consciousness, and for the needs of ""man as man"" to become  needs. History itself is a real part of natural history-of nature's coming to be man. Natural science will in time subsume under itself the science of man, just as the science of man will subsume under itself natural science: there will be one science.
     Man is the immediate object of natural science: for immediate, sensuous nature for man is, immediately, human sensuousness (the expressions are identical ) -presented immediately in the form of the other man sensuously present for him. For his own sensuousness first exists as human sensuousness for himself through the other man. But nature is the immediate object of the science of man: the first object of man-man-is nature, sensuousness; and the particular human sensuous essential powers can only find their self-knowledge in the science of the natural world in general, since they can find their objective realization in natural objects only. The element of thought itself-the element of thought's living expression-language-is of a sensuous nature. The social reality of nature, and human natural science, or the natural science about man, are identical terms.
     It will be seen how in place of the wealth and poverty of political economy come the rich human being and rich human need. The rich human being is simultaneously the human being in need of a totality of human life activities-the man in whom his own realization exists as an inner necessity, as need. Not only wealth, but likewise the poverty of man-given socialism-receives in equal measure a human and therefore social significance. Poverty is the passive bond which causes the human being to experience the need of the- greatest wealth-the other human being. The dominion of the objective being in me, the sensuous outburst of my essential activity, is emotion, which thus becomes here the activity of my being.
      (5) A being only considers himself independent when he stands on his own feet; and he only stands on his own feet when he owes his existence to himself. A man who lives by the grace of another regards himself as a dependent being. But I live completely by the grace of another if owe him not only the sustenance of my life, but if he has, moreover, created my life-if he is the source of my life; and if it is not of my own creation, my life has necessarily a source of this kind outside it. The Creation is therefore an idea very difficult to dislodge from popular consciousness. The self¬mediated being of nature and of man is incomprehensible to it, because it contradicts everything palpable in practical life.
     The creation of the earth has received a mighty blow from geogen -i.e., from the science which presents the formation of the earth, the coming-to-be of the earth, as a process, as self-generation. Generatio aequivoca2 is the only practical refutation of the theory of creation.
     Now it is certainly easy to say to the single individual what Aristotle has already said. You have been begotten by your father and your mother; therefore in you the mating of two human beings-a species-act of human beings-has produced the human being. You see, therefore, that even physically, man owes his existence to man. Therefore you must not only keep sight of the one aspect-the infinite progression which leads you further to enquire: ""Who begot my father? Who his grandfather?"", etc. You must also hold on to the circular movement sensuously perceptible in that progression, by which man repeats himself in procreation, thus always remaining the subject. You will reply, however: I grant you this circular movement; now grant me the progression which drives me even further until I ask: Who begot the first man, and nature as a whole? I can only answer you: Your question is itself a product of abstraction. Ask yourself how you arrived at that question. Ask yourself whether your question is not posed from a standpoint to which I cannot reply, because it is a perverse one. Ask yourself whether that progression as such exists for a reasonable mind. When you ask about the creation of nature and man, you are abstracting, in so doing, from man and nature. You postulate them as non-existent, and yet you want me to prove them to you as existing. Now I say to you: Give up your abstraction and you will also give up your question. Or if you want to hold on to your abstraction, then be consistent, and if you think of man and nature as non-existent, then think of yourself as non-existent, for you too are surely nature and man. Don't think, don't ask me, for as soon as you think and. ask, your abstraction from the existence of nature and man has no meaning. Or are you such an egoist that you postulate everything as nothing, and yet want yourself to be?
     You can reply: I do not want to postulate the nothingness of nature. I ask you about its genesis, just as I ask the anatomist about the formation of bones, etc.
     But since for the socialist man the entire so-called history of the world  is nothing but the begetting of man through human labour, nothing but the coming-to-be of nature for man, he has the visible, irrefutable proof of his birth through himself, of his process of coming-to-be. Since the real existence of man and nature has become practical, sensuous and perceptible-since man has become for man as the being of nature, and nature for man as the being of man-the question about an alien being , about a being above nature and man-a question which implies the admission of the inessentiality of nature and of man-has become impossible in practice. Atheism, as the denial of this inessentiality, has no longer any meaning, for atheism is a negation of God, and postulates the existence of man through this negation; but socialism as socialism no longer stands in any need of such a mediation. It proceeds from the practically and theoretically sensuous consciousness of man and of nature as the essence. Socialism is man's positive self-consciousness no longer mediated through the annulment of religion, just as real life is man's positive reality, no longer mediated through the annulment of private property, through communism. Communism is the position as the negation of the negation, and is hence the actual phase necessary for the next stage of historical development in the process of human emancipation and recovery. Communism is the necessary pattern and the dynamic principle of the immediate future, but communism as such is not the goal of human development-the structure of human society.
                          The Meaning of Human Requirements
      We have seen what significance, given socialism, the wealth of human needs has, and what significance, therefore, both a new mode of production and a new object of production have: a new manifestation of the forces of human nature and a new enrichment of human nature.3 Under private property their significance is reversed: every person speculates on creating a new need in another, so as to drive him to a fresh sacrifice, to place him in a new depend¬ence and to seduce him into a new mode of gratification and therefore economic ruin. Each tries to establish over the other an alien power, so as thereby to find satisfaction .of his own selfish need. The increase in the quantity of objects is accompanied by an extension of the realm of the alien powers to which man is subjected, and every new product represents a new potency of mutual swindling and mutual plundering. Man becomes ever poorer as man; his need for money becomes ever greater if he wants to overpower hostile being; and the power of his money declines exactly in inverse proportion to the increase in the volume of production: that is, his neediness grows as the power of money increases.
     The need for money is therefore the true need produced by the modern economic system, and it is the only need which the latter produces. The quantity of money becomes to an ever greater degree its sole effective attribute: just as it reduces everything to its abstract form, so it reduces itself in the course of its own movement to something merely quantitative. Excess and intemperance come to be its true norm. Subjectively, this is even partly manifested in that the extension of products and needs falls into contriving and ever¬calculating subservience to inhuman, refined, unnatural and imaginary appetites.Private property does not know how to change crudeneed into human need. Its idealism is fantasy, caprice and whim; and no eunuch flatters his despot more basely or uses more despicable means to stimulate his dulled capacity for pleasure in order to sneak a favour for himself than does the industrial eunuch-the producer-in order to sneak for himself a few pennies-in order to charm the golden birds out of the pockets of his Christianly beloved neighbours. He puts himself at the service of the other's most depraved fancies, plays the pimp between him and his need, excites in him morbid appetites, lies in wait for each of his weaknesses-all so that he can then demand the cash for this service of love. (Every product is a bait with which to seduce away the other's very being, his money; every real and possible need is a weakness which will lead the fly to the gluepot. General exploitation of communal human nature, just as every imperfection in man, is a bond with heaven-an avenue giving the priest access to his heart; every need is an opportunity to approach one's neighbour under the guise of the utmost amiability and to say to him: Dear friend, I give you what you need, but you know the conditio sine qua non; you know the ink in which you have to sign yourself over to me; in providing for your pleasure, I fleece you.)
     And partly, this estrangement manifests itself in that it produces refinement of needs and of their means on the one hand, and a bestial barbarization, a complete, unrefined, abstract simplicity of need, on the other; or rather in that it merely resurrects itself in its opposite. Even the need for fresh air ceases for the worker. Man returns to living in a cave, which is now, however, contaminated with the mephitic breath of plague given off by civilization, and which he continues to occupy only precariously, it being for him a n alien habitation which can be withdrawn from him any day-a place from which, if he does not pay, he can be thrown out any day. For this mortuary he has to pay. A dwelling in the light, which Prometheus in Aeschylus designated as one of the greatest boons, by means of which he made the savage into a human being, ceases to exist for the worker. Light, air, etc.-the simplest animal cleanliness-ceases to be a need for man. Dirt-this stagnation and putrefaction of man-the sewage of civilization (speaking quite literally) -comes to be the element of life for him. Utter, unnatural neglect, putrefied nature, comes to be his life-element. None of his senses exist any longer, and not only in his human fashion, but in an inhuman fashion, and therefore not even in an animal fashion. The crudest modes (and instruments) of human labour are coming back: the tread mill of the Roman slaves, for instance, is the means of production, the means of existence, of many English workers. It is not only that man has no human needs-even his animal needs are ceasing to exist. The Irishman no longer knows any need now but the need to eat, and indeed only the need to eat potatoes-and scabby potatoes at that, the worst kind of potatoes. But in each of their industrial towns England and France have already a little Ireland. The savage and the animal have at least the need to hunt, to roam, etc.-the need of companionship. Machine labour is simplified in order to make a worker out of the human being still in the making, the completely immature human being, the child-whilst the worker has become a neglected child. The machine accommodates itself to the weakess of the human being in order to make the weak human being into a machine.
     How the multiplication of needs and of the means of their satisfaction breeds the absence of needs and of means is demonstrated by the political economist (and the capitalist: it should be noted that it is always empirical business men we are talking about when we refer to political economists-their scientific confession and mode of being). This he shows:
      (1) By reducing the worker's need to the barest and most miserable level of physical subsistence, and by reducing his activity to the most abstract mechanical movement. Hence, he says: Man has no other need either of activity or of enjoyment. For he calls even this life human life and existence.
      (2) By counting the lowest possible level of life (existence) as the standard, indeed as the general standard-general because it is applicable to the mass of men. He changes the worker into an insensible being lacking all needs, just as he changes his activity into a pure abstraction from all activity. To him, therefore, every luxury of the worker seems to be reprehensible, and everything that goes beyond the most abstract need-be it in the realm of passive enjoyment, or a manifestation of activity-seems to him a luxury. Political economy, this science of wealth, is therefore simultaneously the science of denial, of want, of thrift, of saving-and it actually reaches the point where it spares man the need of either fresh air or physical exercise. This science of marvellous industry is simultaneously the science of asceticism, and its true ideal is the ascetic but extortionate miser and the ascetic but productive slave. Its moral ideal is the worker who takes part of his wages to the savings-bank, and it has even found ready-made an abject art in which to clothe this its pet idea: they have presented it, bathed in sentimentality, on the stage. Thus political economy-despite its worldly and wanton appearance-is a true moral science, the most moral of all the sciences. Self-denial, the denial of life and of all human needs, is its cardinal doctrine. The less you eat, drink and read books; the less you go to the theatre, the dance, hall, the public¬house; the less you think, love, theorize, sing, paint, fence, etc., the more you save-the greater becomes your treasure which neither moths nor dust will devour-your capital. The less you are, the more you have; the less you express your own life, the greater is your alienated life-the greater is the store of your estranged being. Everything which the political economist takes from you in life and in humanity, he replaces for you in money and in wealth; and all the things which you cannot do, your money can do. It can eat and drink, go to the dance hall and the theatre; it can travel, it can appropriate art, learning, the treasures of the past, political power -all this it can appropriate for you-it can buy all this for you: it is the true endowment. Yet being all this, it is inclined to do nothing but create itself, buy itself; for everything else is after all its servant. And when I have the master I have the servant and do not need his servant. All passions and all activity must therefore be submerged in avarice. The worker may only have enough for him to want to live, and may only want to live in order to have .
     Of course a controversy now arises in the field of political economy. The one side (Lauderdale, Malthus, etc.) recommends luxury and execrates thrift. The other (Say, Ricardo, etc.) recommends thrift and execrates luxury. But the former admits that it wants luxury in order to produce labour (i.e., absolute thrift); and the latter admits that it recommends thrift in order to produce wealth (i.e., luxury). The Lauderdale-Malthus school has the romantic notion that avarice alone ought not to determine the consumption of the rich, and it contradicts its own laws in advancing extravagance as a direct means of enrichment. Against it, therefore, the other side very earnestly and circumstantially proves that I do not increase but reduce my possessions by being extravagant. The Say¬Ricardo school, however, is hypocritical in not admitting that it is precisely whim and caprice which determine production. It forgets the ""refined needs""; it forgets that there would be no production without consumption; it forgets that as a result of competition production can only become more extensive and luxurious. It forgets that it is use that determines a thing's value, and that fashion determines use. It wishes to see only ""useful things"" produced, but it forgets that production of too many useful things produces too large a useless population. Both sides forget that extravagance and thrift, luxury and privation, wealth and poverty are equal.
     And you must not only stint the immediate "",ratification of your senses, as by stinting yourself of food, etc.: you must also spare yourself all sharing of general interest, all sympathy, all trust, etc.; if you want to be economical, if you do not want to be ruined by illusions.
     You must make everything that is yours saleable, i.e., useful. If I ask the political economist: Do I obey economic laws if I extract money by offering my body for sale, by surrendering it to another's lust? (The factory workers in France call the prostitution of their wives and daughters the xth working hour, which is literally correct. ) -Or am I not acting in keeping with political economy if I sell my friend to the Moroccans? ( And the direct sale of men in the form of a trade in conscripts, etc., takes place in all civilized countries.) -Then the political economist replies to me: You do not transgress my laws; but see what Cousin Ethics and Cousin Religion have to say about it. My political economic ethics and religion have nothing to reproach you with, but- But whom am I now to believe, political economy or ethics? The ethics of political economy is acquisition, work, thrift, sobriety-but political economy promises to satisfy my needs. The political economy of ethics is the opulence of a good conscience, of virtue, etc.; but how can I live virtuously if I do not live? And how can I have a good conscience if I am not conscious of anything? It stems from the very nature of estrangement that each sphere applies to me a different and opposite yard¬stick-ethics one and political economy another; for each is a specific estrangement of man and focuses attention on a particular round of estranged essential activity, and each stands in an estranged relation to the other. Thus M. Michel Chevalier reproaches Ricardo with having abstracted from ethics. But Ricardo is allowing political economy to speak its own language, and if it does not speak ethically, this is not Ricardo's fault. M. Chevalier abstracts from political economy in so far as he moralizes, but he really and necessarily abstracts from ethics in so far as he practises political economy. The reference of political economy to ethics, if it is other than an arbitrary, contingent and therefore unfounded and unscientific reference, if it is not being put up as a sham but is meant to be essential, can only be the reference of the laws of polit¬ical economy to ethics. If there is no such connection, or if the contrary is rather the case, can Ricardo help it? Besides, the opposition between political economy and ethics is only a sham opposition and just as much no opposition as it is an opposition. All that happens is that political economy expresses moral laws in its own way.
     Needlessness as the principle of political economy is most brilliantly shown in its theory of population. There are too many people. Even the existence of men is a pure luxury; and if the worker is ""ethical,"" he will be sparing in procreation. ( Mill suggests public acclaim for those who prove themselves continent in their sexual relations, and public rebuke for those who sin against such barrenness of marriage.... Is not this the ethics, the teaching of asceticism?) The production of people appears in the form of public misery.
     The meaning which production has in relation to the rich is seen revealed in the meaning which it has for the poor. At the top themanifestation is always refined, veiled, ambiguous-a sham; lower, it is rough, straightforward, frank-the real thing. The worker's crude need is a far greater source of gain than the refined need of the rich. The cellar-dwellings in London bring more to those who let them than do the palaces; that is to say, with reference to the landlord they constitute greater wealth, and thus (to speak the language of political economy) greater social wealth.
     Industry speculates on the refinement of needs, but it speculates just as much on their crudeness, but on their artificially produced crudeness, whose true enjoyment, therefore, is self-stupefaction¬this seeming satisfaction of need-this civilization contained within the crude barbarism of need; the English gin-shops are therefore the symbolical embodiments of private property. Their luxury reveals the true relation of industrial luxury and wealth to man. They are therefore rightly the only Sunday pleasures of the people, dealt with at least mildly by the English police.
     We have already seen how the political economist establishes the unity of labour and capital in a variety of ways:- (1) Capital is accumulated labour. (2) The purpose of capital within production -partly, reproduction of capital with profit, partly, capital as raw material ( material of labour) , and partly, as itself a working instrument (the machine is capital directly equated with labour)-is productive labour. (3) The worker is a capital. (4) Wages belong to costs of capital. (5) In relation to the worker, labour is the reprod¬uction of his life-capital. (6) In relation to the capitalist, labour is an aspect of his capital's activity.
     Finally, (7) the political economist postulates the original unity of capital and labour in the form of the unity of the capitalist and the worker; this is the original state of paradise. The way in which these two aspects in the form of two persons leap at each other's throats is for the political economist a contingent event, and hence only to be explained by reference to external factors. (See Mill.) 4
      The nations which are still dazzled by the sensuous splendour of precious metals, and are therefore still fetish-worshippers of metal money, are -not yet fully developed money-nations.-Contrast of France and England. The extent to which the solution of theoreti¬cal riddles is the task of practice and effected through practice, just as true practice is the condition of a real and positive theory, is shown, for example, in fetishism. The sensuous consciousness of the fetish-worshipper is different from that of the Greek, because his sensuous existence is still different. The abstract enmity between sense and spirit is necessary so long as the human feeling for nature, the human sense of nature, and therefore also the natural sense of man, are not yet produced by man's own labour.
     Equality is nothing but a translation of the German ""Ich=Ich"" into the French, i.e., political form. Equality as the groundwork of communism is its political justification, and it is the same as when the German justifies it by conceiving man as universal self-consciousness. Naturally, the transcendence of the estrangement always proceeds from that form of the estrangement which is the dominant power: in Germany, self-consciousness; in France, equality, because politics; in England, real, material, practical need taking only itself as its standard. It is from this standpoint that Proudhon is to be criticized and appreciated.
     If we characterize communism itself because of its character as negation of the negation, as the appropriation of the human essence which mediates itself with itself through the negation of private property-as being not yet the true, self-originating position but rather a position originating from private property, 5
     Since in that case8 the real estrangement of the life of man remains, and remains all the more, the more one is conscious of it as such, it may be accomplished solely by putting communism into operation.
     In order to abolish the idea of private property, the idea of communism is completely sufficient. It takes actual communist action to abolish actual private property. History will come to it; and this movement, which in theory we already know to be a self-transcending movement, will constitute in actual fact a very severe and protracted process. But we must regard it as a real advance to have gained beforehand a consciousness of the limited character as well as of the goal of this historical movement-and a consciousness which reaches out beyond it.
     When communist workmen associate with one another, theory, propaganda, etc., is their first end. But at the same time, as a result of this association, they acquire a new need-the need for society -and what appears as a means becomes an end. You can observe this practical process in its most splendid results whenever you see French socialist workers together. Such things as smoking, drinking, eating, etc., are no longer means of contact or means that bring together. Company, association, and conversation, which again has society as its end, are enough for them; the brotherhood of man is no mere phrase with them, but a fact of life, and the nobility of man shines upon us from their work-hardened bodies .
     When political economy claims that demand and supply always balance each other, it immediately forgets that according to its own claim ( theory of population ) the supply of people always exceeds the demand, and that, therefore, in the essential result of the whole production process-the existence of man-the disparity between demand and supply gets its most striking expression.
     The extent to which money, which appears as a means, constitutes true power and the sale end-the extent to which in general that means which gives me substance, which gives me possession of the objective substance of others, is an end in itself-can be clearly seen from the facts that landed property wherever land is the source of life, and horse and sword wherever these are the true means of life, are also acknowledged as the true political powers in life. In the middle ages a social class is emancipated as soon as it is allowed to carry the sword. Amongst nomadic peoples it is the horse which makes me a free man and a participant in the life of the community.
     We have said above that man is regressing to the cave dwelling etc.-but that he is regressing to it in an estranged, malignant form. The savage in his cave-a natural element which freely offers itself for his use and protection-feels himself no more a stranger, or rather feels himself to be just as much at home as a fish in water. But the cellar-dwelling of the poor man is a hostile dwelling, ""an alien, restraining power which only gives itself up to him in so far as he gives up to it his blood and sweat""-a dwelling which he cannot look upon as his own home where he might at last exclaim, "" Here I am at home,"" but where instead he finds himself in someone else's house, in the house of a stranger who daily lies in wait for him and throws him out if he does not pay his rent. Similarly, he is also aware of the contrast in quality between his dwelling and a human dwelling-a residence in that other world, the heaven of wealth.
     Estrangement is manifested not only in the fact that my means of life belong to someone else, that my desire is the inaccessible possession of another, but also in the fact that everything is in itself something different from itself-that my activity is something else and that, finally ( and this applies also to the capitalist ) , all is under the sway of inhuman power. There is a form of inactive, extravagant wealth given over wholly to pleasure, the enjoyer of which on the one hand behaves as a mere ephemeral individual frantically spending himself to no purpose knows the slave-labour of others (human sweat and blood) as the prey of his cupidity, and therefore knows man himself, and hence also his own self, as a sacrificed and empty being. With such wealth the contempt of man makes its appearance, partly as arrogance and as the throwing-away of what can give sustenance to a hundred human lives, and partly as the infamous illusion that his own unbridled extravagance and ceaseless, unproductive consumption is the condition of the other's labour and therefore of his subsistence. He knows the realization of the essential powers of man only as the realization of his own excesses, his whims and capricious, bizarre notions. This wealth which, on the other hand, again knows wealth as a mere means, as something that is good for nothing but to be annihilated and which is therefore at once slave and master, at once generous and mean, capricious, preumptuous, conceited, refined, cultured and witty-this wealth has not yet experienced wealth as an utterly alien power  over itself: it sees in it, rather, only its own power, and not wealth but gratification 7final aim and end.
                                                      * * *
     Society, as it appears to the political economist, is civil society, in which every individual is a totality of needs and only exists for the other person, as the other exists for him, in so far as each becomes a means for the other. The political economist reduces everything ( just as does politics in its Rights of Man) to man, i.e., to the individual whom he strips of all determinateness so as to class him as capitalist or worker.
     The division of labour is the expression in political economy of the social character of labour within the estrangement. Or, since labour is only an expression of human activity within alienation, of the living of life as the alienating of life, the division of labour, too, is therefore nothing else but the estranged, alienated positing of human activity as a real activity of the species or as activity of man as a species being.
     As for the essence of the division of labour-and of course the division of labour had to be conceived as a major driving force in the production of wealth as soon as labour was recognized as the essence of private property-i.e., about the estranged and alienated form of human activity as an activity of the species-the political economists are very unclear and self-contradictory about it.
                                                      * * *
                          The Power of Money in Bourgeois Society
      If man's feelings, passions, etc., are not merely anthropological phenomena in the  8 sense, but truly ontological affirmations o-f essential being ( of nature ) , and if they are only really affirmed because their object exists for them as an object of sense, then it is clear:
      (1) That they have by no means merely one mode of affirmation, but rather that the distinctive character of their existence, of their life, is constituted by the distinctive mode of their affirmation. In what manner the object exists for them, is the characteristic mode of their gratification.
      (2) Whenever the sensuous affirmation is the direct annulment of the object in its independent form (as in eating, drinking, working up of the object, etc. ), this is the affirmation of the object.
      (3) In so far as man, and hence also his feeling, etc., are human, the affirmation of the object by another is likewise his own enjoyment.
      (4) Only through developed industry-i.e., through the medium of private property-does the ontological essence cif human passion come to be both in its totality and in its humanity; the science of man is therefore itself a product of man's establishment of himself by practical activity.
      (5) The meaning of private property-liberated from its estrangement-is the existence of essential objects for man, both as objects of enjoyment and as objects of activity.
      By possessing the property of buying everything, by possessing the property of appropriating all objects, money is thus the object of eminent possession. The universality of its property is the omnipotence of its being. It therefore functions as the almighty being. Money is the pimp between man's need and the object, between his life and his means of life. But that which mediates my life for me, also mediates the existence of other people for me. For me it is the other person.
                   ""What, man! confound it, hands and feet
                  And head and backside, all are yours !
                   And what we take while life is sweet,
                  Is that to be declared not ours?
                       Six stallions, say, I can afford,
                       Is not their strength my property?
                       I tear along, a sporting lord,
                        As if their legs belonged to me.""
                                      ( Mephistopheles, in Faust) 9
Shakespeare in Timon of Athens:
             "" Gold? Yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, Gods,
             I am no idle votarist! . . . Thus much of this will
                       make black white, foul fair,
             Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
            ... Why, this
             Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
             Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:
             This yellow slave
             Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed;
             Make the hoar l eprosy adored, place thieves
             And give them title, knee and approbation
             With senators on the bench: This is it
             That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;
             She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores
             Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices
             To the April day again....Damned earth,
             Thou common whore of mankind, that putt'st odds
             Among the rout of nations.""1
And also later :
             ""O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
             Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
             Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
             Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,
             Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
             That lies on Dian's lap! Thou visible God!
             That solder'st close impossibilities,
             And mak'st them kiss! That speak'st with every tongue,
             To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!
             Think thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue
             Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
            May have the world in empire!""2
     Shakespeare excellently depicts the real nature of money. To understand him, let us begin, first of all, by expounding the passage from Goethe.
     That which is for me through the medium of money-that for which I can pay (i.e., which money can buy ) -that am I, the possessor of the money. The extent of the power of money is the extent of my power. Money's properties a re my properties and essential powers-the properties and powers of its possessor. Thus, what I am and am capable of is by no means determined by my individuality. I am ugly, but I can buy for myself the most beautiful of women. Therefore I am not ugly, for the effect of ugliness-its deterrent power-is nullified by money. I,  in my character as an, individual, am lame, but money furnishes me with twentyfour feet . Therefore I am not lame. I am bad, dishonest, unscrupulous, stupid; but money is honoured, and therefore so is its possessor. Money is the supreme good, therefore its possessor is good. Money, besides, saves me the trouble of being dishonest: I am therefore presumed honest. I am stupid, but money is the real  mind of all things and how then should its possessor be stupid? Besides, he can buy talented people for himself, and is he who has power over the talented not more talented than the talented? Do not I, who thanks to money am capable of all that the human heart longs for, possess all human capacities? Does not my money therefore transform all my incapacities into their contrary?
     If money is the bond binding me to human life, binding society to me, binding me and nature and man, is not money the bond of all bonds? Can it not dissolve and bind all ties? Is it not, therefore, the universal agent of divorce? It is the true agent of divorce as well as the true binding agent-the 3galvano-chemical power of Society.
     Shakespeare stresses especially two properties of money: (1) It is the visible divinity-the transformation of all human and natural properties into their contraries, the universal confounding and overturning of things : it makes brothers of impossibilities. (2) It is the common whore, the common pimp of people and nations.
     The overturning and confounding of all human and natural qualities, the fraternization of impossibilities-the divine power of money-lies in its character as men's estranged, alienating and self-disposing species-nature. Money is the alienated ability of mankind.
     That which I am unable to do as a man, and of which therefore all my individual essential powers are incapable, I am able to do by means of money. Money thus turns each of these powers into something which in itself it is not-turns it, that is, into its contrary.
     If I long for a particular dish or want to take the mail-coach because I am not strong enough to go by foot, money fetches me the dish and the mail-coach: that is, it converts my wishes from something in the realm of imagination, translates them from their meditated, imagined or willed existence into their sensuous, actual existence-from imagination to life, from imagined being into real being. In effecting this mediation, money is the truly creative power.
     No doubt demand also exists for him who has no money, but his demand is a mere thing of the imagination without effect or existence for me, for a third party, for the others, and which therefore remains for me unreal and objectless. The difference between effective demand based on money and ineffective demand based on my need, my passion, my wish, etc., is the difference between being and thinking, between the imagined which exists merely within me and the imagined as it is for me outside me as a real object.
     If I have no money for travel, I have no need-that is, no real and self-realizing need-to travel. If I have the vocation for studybut no money for it, I have no vocation for study-that is, no effective, no true vocation. On the other hand, if I have really no vocation for study but have the will and the money for it, I have an effective vocation for it. Being the external, common medium and faculty for turning an image into reality and reality into a mere image (a faculty not springing from man as man or from human society as society), money transforms the real essential powers of man and nature into what are m erely abstract conceits and therefore imperfections-into tormenting chimeras-just as it transforms real imperfections and chimeras-essential powers which are really impotent, which exist only in the imagination of the individual-into real powers and faculties.
     In the light of this characteristic alone, money is thus the general overturning of individualities which turns them into their contrary and adds contradictory attributes to their attributes .
     Money, then, appears as this overturning power both against the individual and against the bonds of society, etc., which claim to be essences in themselves . It transforms fidelity into infidelity, love into hate, hate into l ove, virtue into vice, vice into virtue, servant into master, master into servant, idiocy into intelligence and intelligence into idiocy.
     Since money, as the existing and active concept of value, confounds and exchanges all things, it is the general confounding and compounding of all things-the world upside-dawn-the confounding and compounding of all natural and human qualities.
     He who can buy bravery is brave, though a coward. As money is not exchanged for any one specific quality, for any one specific thing, or for any particular human essential power, but for the entire objective world of man and nature, from the standpoint of its possessor it therefore serves to exchange every property for every other, even contradictory, property and object: it is the fraternization of impossibilities. It makes contradictions embrace.
     Assume man to be man and his relationship to the world to be a human one: then you can exchange love only for love, trust for trust, etc. If you want to enjoy art, you must be an artistically¬cultivated person; if you want to exercise influence over other people, you m ust be a person with a stimulating and encouraging effect on other people. Every one of your relations to man and to nature must be a specific expression, corresponding to the object of your will, of your real individual life. If you love without evoking love in return-that is, if your loving as loving does not produce reciprocal love; if through a living expression of yourself as a loving person you do not make yourself a loved person, then your love is impotent-a misfortune.
                    Critique of the Hegelian Dialectic and Philosophy
                                                 as a Whole
      (6) This is perhaps the place at which, by way of explaining and justifying the ideas here presented, we might offer some considerations in regard to the Hegelian dialectic generally and especially its exposition in the Phenomenology and Logic, and also, lastly, the relation to it of the modern critical movement.
      So powerful was modern German criticism's preoccupation with the past-so completely was it possessed in its development by its subject-matter-that there prevailed a completely uncritical attitude to the method of criticizing, together with a complete lack of awareness about the seemingly formal, but really vital question: how do we now stand as regards the Hegelian dialectic? This lack of awareness about the relationship of modern criticism to the Hegelian philosophy as a whole and especially to the Hegelian dialectic has been so great that critics like Strauss and Bruno Bauer still remain wholly within the confines of the Hegelian Logic; the former completely so and the latter at least implicitly so in his Synoptics4 (where, in opposition to Strauss, he replaces the substance of ""abstract nature"" by the ""self-consciousness"" of abstract man) and even in Christianity Discovered.5 Thus in Christianity Discovered, for example, you get:
            ""As though in positing the world, self-consciousness posits that
      which is different from itself, and in what it posits it posits itself,
      because it in turn annuls the difference between what it has
      posited and itself, inasmuch as it itself has being only in the
      positing and the movement.-How then can it not have its pur-
      pose in this movement?"" etc.; or again: ""They"" ( the French mate-
      rialists ) ""have not yet been able to see that it is only as the
      movement of self-consciousness that the movement of the uni-
      verse has actually come to be for itself, and achieved unity with
      itself.""
      Such expressions do not even show any verbal divergence from the HegelIan approach, but on the contrary, repeat it word for word .
      How little consciousness there was in relation to the Hegelian dialectic dunng the act of criticism ( Bauer, The Synoptics), and how  little little this consciousness came into being even after the act of material criticism is proved by Bauer when, in his The Good of Freedom,6 he dismisses the brash question put by Herr Gruppe¬ ''What about logic now?""-by referring him to future critics.
     But even now-now that Feuerbach both in his Theses in the Anecdotis and, in detail, in The Philosophy of the Future, has in principle overthrown the old dialectic and philosophy; now that that school of criticism, on the other hand, which was incapable of accomplishing this has all the same seen it accomplished and has proclaimed itself pure, resolute, absolute criticism-criticism that has come into the clear with itself; now that this criticism, in its spiritual pride, has reduced the whole process of history to the relation between the rest of the world and itself ( the rest of the world, in contrast to itself, falling under the category of ""the masses"" ) and dissolved all dogmatic antithesis into the single dogmatic antithesis of its own cleverness and the stupidity of the world-the antithesis of the critical Christ and Mankind, the rabble; now that daily and hourly it has demonstrated its own excellence against the dullness of the'masses; now, finally, that it has proclaimed the critical Last Judgement in the shape of an announcement that the day is approaching when the whole of expiring humanity will assemble before it and be sorted by it into groups, each particular mob receiving its testimonium paupertatis;7 now that it has made known in print8 its superiority to human feelings as well as its superiority to the world, over which it sits enthroned in sublime solitude, only letting -fall from time to time from its sarcastic lips the ringing laughter of the Olympian Gods-even now, after all these delightful antics of moribund idealism in the guise of criticism (i.e., of Young-Hegelianism)-even now it has not expressed the suspicion that the time was ripe for a critical settling of accounts with the mother of Young-Hegelianism-the Hegelian dialectic-and even h ad  to say about its critical attitude towards the Feuerbachian dialectic. Criticism with a completely uncritical attitude to itself!
     Feuerbach is the only one who has a serious, critical attitude to the Hegelian dialectic and who has made genuine discoveries in this field. He is in fact the true conqueror of the old philosophy. The extent of his achievement, and the unpretentious simplicity With which he, Feuerbach, gives it to the world, stand in striking contrast to the reverse.
     Feuerbach's great achievement is:
      (1) The proof that philosophy is nothing else but religion rendered into thoughts and thinking expounded, and that it has therefore likewise to be condemned as another form and manner of existence of the estrangement of the essence of man;
      (2) The establishment of true materialism and of real science, since Feuerbach also makes the social relationship ""of man to man"" the basic principle of the theory;
      ( 3) His opposing to the negation of the negation, which claims to be the absolute positive, the self-supporting positive, positively grounded on itself.
     Feuerbach explains the Hegelian dialectic (and thereby justifies starting out from the positive, from sense-certainty) as follows:
     Hegel sets out from the estrangement of Substance ( in Logic, from the Infinite, the abstractly universal ) -from the absolute and fixed abstraction; which means, put popularly, that he sets out from religion and theology.
     Secondly, he annuls the infinite, and establishes the actual, sensuous, real, finite, particular (philosophy-annulment of religion and theology).
     Thirdly, he again annuls the positive and restores the abstraction, the infinite-restoration of religion and theology.
     Feuerbach thus conceives the negation of the negation only as a contradiction of philosophy with itself-as the philosophy which affirms theology ( the transcendent, etc. ) after having denied it, and which it therefore affirms in opposition to itself.
     The position or self-affirmation and self-confirmation contained in the negation of the negation is taken to be a position which is not yet sure of itself, which is therefore burdened with its opposite, which is doubtful of itself and therefore in need of proof, and which, therefore, is not a position establishing itself by its existence-not a position that justifies itself; hence it is directly and immediately confronted by the self-grounded position of sense-certanity.9
     But because Hegel has conceived the negation of the negation from the point of view of the positive relation inherent in it as the true and only positive, and from the point of view of the negative relation inherent in it as the only true act and self-realizing act of all being, he has only found the abstract, logical, speculative expression for the movement of history; and this historical process is not yet the real history of man-of man as a given subject, but only man's act of genesis-the story of man's origin: We shall explain both the abstract form of this process , and the difference between this process as it is in Hegel in contrast to modern criticism, that is, in contrast to the same process in Feuerbach's Wesen des Christentums (Essence of Christianity), or rather the critical form of this in Hegel still uncritical process.
     Let us take a look at the Hegelian system. One must begin with Hegel's Phenomenology, the true point of origin and the secret of the Hegelian philosophy.

                                        D. Absolute Knowledge
Hegel's Encyclopaedia,2 beginning as it does with Logic, with pure speculative thought, and ending with Absolute Knowledge-with the self-conscious, self-comprehending, philosophic or absolute (i.e., superhuman) abstract mind-is in its entirety nothing but the display, the self-objectification, of the essence of the philosophic mind, and the philosophic mind is nothing but the estranged mind of the world thinking within its self-estrangement-i.e., comprehending itself abstractly. Logic ( mind's coin of the realm, the speculative or thought-value of man and nature-their essence grown totally indifferent to all real determinateness, and hence their unreal essence) is alienated thinking, and therefore thinking which abstracts from nature and from real man: abstract thinking. Then: The externality of this abstract thinking… nature, as it is for this abstract thinking. Nature is external to it-its self-loss; and it apprehends nature also in an external fashion, as abstract thinking-but as alienated abstract thinking. Finally, Mind, this thinking returning home to its own point of origin-the thinking which, as the anthropological, phenomenological, psychological, ethical, artistic and religious mind, is not valid for itself, until ultimately it finds itself, and relates itself to itself, as absolute knowledge in the hence absolute, i.e., abstract mind, and so receives its conscious embodiment in a mode of being corresponding to it. For its real mode of being is abstraction.
     There is a double error in Hegel.
     The first emerges most clearly in the Phenomenology, the Hegelian philosophy's place of origin. When, for instance, wealth, state-power, etc., are understood by Hegel as entities estranged from the human being, this only happens in their form as thoughts . . . They are thought-entities, and therefore merely an estrangement of pure, i.e., abstract, philosophical thinking. The whole process therefore ends with Absolute Knowledge. It is precisely abstract thought from which these objects are estranged and which they confront with their arrogation of reality. The philosopher sets up himself (that is, one who is himself an abstract form of estranged man) as the measuring-rod of the estranged world. The whole history of the alienation-process and the whole process of the retraction of the alienation is therefore nothing but the history of the production of abstract (i.e., absolute) thought-of logical, speculative thought. The estrangement, which therefore forms the real interest of this alienation and of the transcendence of this alienation, is the opposition of in itself and for itself, of consciousness and self-consciousness, of object and subject-that is to say, .it is the opposition, within thought itself, between abstract thinking and sensuous reality or real sensuousness. All other oppositions and movements of these oppositions are but the semblance, the cloak, the exoteric shape of these oppositions which alone matter, and which constitute the meaning of these other, profane oppositions. It is not the fact that the human being objectifies himself inhumanly,in opposition to himself, but the fact that he objectifies himself in distinction from and in opposition to abstract thinking, that is the posited essence of the estrangement and the thing to be superseded.
     The appropriation of man's essential powers, which have become objects-indeed, alien objects-is thus in the first place only an appropriation occurring in consciousness, in pure thought-i.e., in abstraction: it is the appropriation of these objects as thoughts and as movements of thought. Consequently, despite its thoroughly negative and critical appearance and despite the criticism really contained in it, which often anticipates far later development, there is already latent in the Phenomenology as a germ, a potentiality, a secret, the uncritical positivism and the equally uncritical idealism of Hegel's later works-that philosophic dissolution and restoration of the existing empirical world. In the second place: the vindication of the objective world for man-for example, the realization that sensuous consciousness is not an abstractly sensuous consciousness but a humanly sensuous consciousness-that religion, wealth, etc., are but the estranged world of human objectification, of man’s essential powers given over to work and that they are therefore but the path to the true human world-this appropriation or the insight into this process consequently appears in Hegel in this form, that sense, religion, state-power, etc., are spiritual entities; for only mind is the true essence of man, and the true form of mind is thinking mind, the logical, speculative mind. The humanness of nature and of the nature begotten by history-the humanness of man's products-appears in the form that they are products of abstract mind and as such, therefore, phases of mind-thought entities. The Phenomenology is, therefore, an occult critique-still to itself obscure and mystifying criticism; but inasmuch as it keeps steadily in view man's estrangement, even though man appears only in the shape of mind, there lie concealed in it all the elements of criticism, already prepared and elaborated in a manner often rising far above the Hegelian standpoint. The ""Unhappy Consciousness,"" the ""Honest Consciousness,"" the struggle of the ""Noble and Base Consciousness,"" etc.,-these separate sections contain, but still in .an estranged form, the critical elements of whole spheres such as religion, the state, civil life, etc. Just as entities, objects, appear as thought-entities, so the subject is always consciousness or self-consciousness; or rather the object appears only as abstract consciousness, man only as self-consciousness: the distinct forms of estrangement which make their appearance are, therefore, only various forms of consciousness and self-consciousness. Just as in itself abstract consciousness ( the form in which the object is conceived) is merely a moment of distinction of self-consciousness, what appears as the result of the movement is the identity of self¬consciousness with consciousness-absolute knowledge-the movement of abstract thought no longer directed outwards but going on now oniy within its own self: that is to say, the dialectic of pure thought is the result.
     The outstanding thing in Hegel's Phenomenology and its final outcome-that is, the dialectic of negativity as the moving and generating principle-is thus first that Hegel conceives the self-genesis of man as a process, conceives objectification as loss of the object, as alienation and as transcendence of this alienation; that he thus grasps the essence of labour and comprehends objective man-true, because real man-as the outcome of man's own labour. The real, active orientation of man to himself as a species being, or his manifestation as a real species being ( i.e., as a human being ) , is only possible by his really bringing out of himself all the powers that are his as the species man-something which in turn is only possible through the totality of man's actions, as the result of history-is only possible by man's treating these generic powers as objects: and this, to begin with, is again only possible in the form of estrangement.
     We shall now demonstrate in detail Hegel's one-sidedness and limitations as they are displayed in the final chapter of the Phenomenology, ""Absolute Knowledge""-a chapter which contains the concentrated spirit of the Phenomenology, the relationship of the Phenomenology to speculative dialectic, and also Hegel's consciousness concerning both and their relationship to one another.
       Let us provisionally say just this much in advance: Hegel's standpoint is that of modern political economy. He grasps labour as the essence of man-as man's essence in the act of proving itself: he sees only the positive, not the negative side of labour. Labour is man's coming to-be for himself within alienation, or as alienated man. The only labour which Hegel knows and recognizes is abstractly mental labour. Therefore, that which constitutes the essence of philosophy-the alienation of man in his knowing of himself, or alienated science thinking itself-Hegel grasps as its essence; and he is therefore able vis-à-vis preceding philosophy to gather together its separate elements and phases, and to present his philosophy as the philosophy. What the other philosophers did¬that they grasped separate phases of nature and of human life as phases of self-consciousness, and indeed of abstract self-consciousness-is known to Hegel as the doings of philosophy. Hence his science is absolute.
     Let us now turn to our subject.
     Absolute Knowledge. The last chapter of the ""Phenomenology.""
     The main point is that the object of consciousness is nothing else but self-consciousness, or that the object is only objectified self-consciousness-self-consciousness as object.
    ( Positing of man=self-consciousness.)
     The issue, therefore, is to surmount the ,object of consciousness. Objectivity as such is regarded as an estranged human relationship which does not correspond to the essence of man, to self¬consciousness. The re-appropriation of the objective essence of man, begotten in the form of estrangement as something alien, has the meaning therefore not only to annul estrangement, but objectivity as well. Man, that is to say, is regarded as a non-objective, spiritual being.
     The movement of surmounting the object of consciousness is now described by Hegel in the following way:
     The object reveals itself not merely as returning into the self-for Hegel that is the one-sided way of apprehending this movement, the grasping of only one side. Man is posited as equivalent to self. The self, however, is only the abstractly conceived man-man begotten by abstraction. Man is egotistic. His eye, his ear, etc., are egotistic. In him every one of his essential powers has the quality of selfhood. But it is quite false to say an that account ""Self-consciousness has eyes, ears, essential powers."" Self-consciousness is rather a quality of human nature, of the human eye, etc.; it is not human nature that is a quality of self-consciousness.
     The self-abstracted and fixed for itself is man as abstract egoist-egoism raised in its pure abstraction to the level of thought. (We shall return to this point later.)
     For Hegel the essence of man-man-equals self-consciousness. All estrangement of the human essence is therefore nothing but estrangement of self-consciousness. The estrangement of self¬consciousness is not regarded as an expression of the real estrangement of the human being-its expression reflected in the realm of knowledge and thought. Instead, the real estrangement-that which appears real-is from its innermost, hidden nature (a nature only brought to light by philosophy) nothing but the manifestation of the estrangement of the real essence of man, of self¬consciousness. The science which comprehends this is therefore called Phenomenology. All re-appropriation of the estranged objective essence appears, therefore, as a process of incorporation into self-consciousness : The man who takes hold of his essential being is merely the self-consciousness which takes hold of objective essences. Return of the object into the self is therefore the re-appropriation of the object.
     The surmounting of the object of consciousness, comprehensively expressed, means: 4
      (1) That the object as such presents itself to consciousness as something vanishing. (2) That it is the alienation of self¬consciousness which establishes thinghood. (3) That this externalization5 of self-consciousness has not merely a negative but a positive significance. (4) That it has this meaning not merely for us or intrinsically, but for self-consciousness itself. (5) For self-consciousness, the negative of the object, its annulling of itself, has positive significance-self-consciousness knows this nullity of the object-because self-consciousness itself alienates itself; for in this alienation it establishes itself as object, or, for the sake of the indivisible unity of being-for-self, establishes the object as itself. (6) On the other hand, there is also this other moment in the process, that self-consciousness has also just as much annulled and superseded this alienation and objectivity and resumed them into itself, being thus at home with itself in its other-being as such (7) This is the movement of consciousness and in this movement consciousness is the totality of its moments. (8) Consciousness must similarly have taken up a relation to the object in all its aspects and phases, and have comprehended it from the point of view of each of them. This totality of its determinate characteristics makes the object intrinsically a spiritual being; and it becomes so in truth for consciousness through the apprehending of each single one of them as self or through what was called above the spiritual attitude to them.
     As to (1): That the object as such presents itself to consciousness as something vanishing-this is the above-mentioned return of the object into the self.
     As to (2): The alienation of self-consciousness establishes thinghood. Because man equals self-consciousness, his alienated, objective essence, or thinghood, equals alienated self-consciousness, and thinghood is thus established through this alienation (thing hood being that which is an object for man and an object for him is really only that which is to him an essential object, therefore his objective essence. And since it is not real Man, nor therefore Nature-Man being human Nature-who as such is made the subject, but only the abstraction of man-self-consciousness-thinghood cannot be anything but alienated self-conciousness ). It is only to be expected that a living, natural being equipped and endowed with objective (i.e., material) essential powers should have real natural objects of his essence; as is the fact that his self-alienation should lead to the establishing of a real, objective world-but a world in the form of externality-a world, therefore, not belonging to his own essential being, and an over¬powering world. There is nothing incomprehensible or mysterious in this. It would be mysterious, rather, if it were otherwise. But it is equally clear that a self-consciousness can only establish thinghoodthrough its alienation-i.e., establish something which itself is only an abstract thing, a thing of abstraction and not a real thing. It is clear, further, that thinghood is therefore utterly without any independence, any essentiality vis-à-vis self-consciousness; that on the contrary, it is a mere creature-something posited by self-consciousness. And what is posited, instead of confirming itself, is but a confirmation of the act of positing in which is concentrated for a moment the energy of the act as its product, seeming to give the deposit-but only for a moment-the character of an independent, real substance.1
     Whenever real, corporeal man, man with his feet firmly on the solid ground, man exhaling and inhaling all the forces of nature, establishes his real, objective essential powers as alien objects by his externalization, it is not the act of positing which is the subject in this process: it is the subjectivity of objective essential powers whose action, therefore, must also be something obfective.  A being who is objective acts objectively, and he would not act objectively if the objective did not reside in the very nature of his being. He creates or establishes only objects, because he is established by objects-because at bottom he is nature. In the act of establishing, therefore, this objective being does not fall from his state of ""pure activity"" into a creating of the object; on the contrary, his objective product only confirms his objective activity, establishing his activity as the activity of an objective, natural being.
     Here we see how consistent naturalism or humanism distinguishes itself both from idealism and materialism, constituting at the same time the unifying truth of both. We see also how only naturalism is capable of comprehending the act of world history.
     Man is directly a natural being. As a natural being and as a living natural being he is on the one hand furnished with natural powers of life-he is an active natural being. These forces exist in him as tendencies and abilities-as impulses. On the other hand, as a natural, corporeal, sensuous, objective being he is a suffering, conditioned and limited creature, like animals and plants. That is to say, the objects of his impulses exist outside him, as objects independent of him; yet these objects are objects of his need-essential objects, indispensable to the manifestation and confirmation of his essential powers. To say that man is a corporeal, living, real, sensuous, objective being full of natural vigour is to say that he has real, sensuous, objects as the objects of his being or of his life, or that he can only express his life in real, sensuous objects. To be objective, natural and sensuous, and at the same time to have object, nature and sense outside oneself, or oneself to be object, nature and sense for a third party, is one and the same thing. Hunger is a natural need; it therefore needs a nature outside itself,  an object outside itself, in order to satisfy itself, to be stilled. Hunger is an acknowledged need of my body for an object existing outside it, indispensable to its integration and to the expression of its essential being. The sun is the object of the plant-an indispensable object to it, confirming its life-just as the plant is an object of the sun, being an expression of the life-awakening power of the sun, of the sun's objective essential power.
     A being which does not have its nature outside itself is not a natural being, and plays no part in the system of nature. A being which has no object outside itself is not an objective being. A being which is not itself an object for some third being has no being for its object; i.e., it is not objectively related. Its being is not objective. 1
     An unobjective being is a nullity-an un-being.
     Suppose a being which is neither an object itself, nor has an object. Such a being, in the first place, would be the unique being: there would exist no being outside it-it would-exist solitary and alone. For as soon as there are objects outside me, as soon as I am not alone, I am another-another reality than the object outside me. For this third object I am thus an other reality than it; that is, I am its object. Thus, to suppose a being which is not the object of another being is to presuppose that no objective being exists. As soon as I have an object, this object has me for an object. But a non-objective being is an unreal, nonsensical thing-something merely thought of (merely imagined, that is)-a creature of abstraction. To be sensuous, that is, to be an object of sense, to be a sensuous object, and thus to have sensuous objects outside one¬self-objects of one's sensuousness. To be sensuous is to suffer.8
     Man as an objective, sensuous being is therefore a suffering being-and because he feels what he suffers, a passionate being. Passion is the essential force of man energetically bent on its object.
     But man is not merely a natural being: he is a human natural being. That is to say, he is a being for himself. Therefore he is a species being, and has to confirm and manifest himself as such both in his being and in his knowing. Therefore, human objects are not natural objects as they immediately present themselves, and neither is human sense as it immediately is-as it is objectively¬human sensibility, human objectivity. Neither nature objectively nor nature subjectively is directly given in a form adequate to the human being. And as everything natural has to have its beginning, man too has his act of coming-to-be-history-which, however, is for him a known history, and hence as an act of coming-to-be it is a conscious self-transcending act of coming-to-be. History is the true natural history of man (on which more later) .
     Thirdly, because this establishing of thinghood is itself only sham, an act contradicting the nature of pure activity, it has to be cancelled again and thinghood denied.
     Re. 3, 4, 5 and 6. (3) This externalization of consciousness has not merely a negative but a positive significance, and (4) it has this meaning not merely for us or intrinsically, but for consciousness itself.9 (5) For consciousness the negative of the object, its annulling of itself, has positive significance-consciousness knows this nullity of the object because it alienates itself; for in this alienoation it knows itself as object, or, for the sake of the indivisible unity of being-for•itself, the object as itself. (6) On the other hand, there is also this other moment in the process, that consciousness has also just as much annulled and superseded this alienation and objectivity and resumed them into itself, being thus at home with itself in its other-being as such.
     As we have already seen: the appropriation of what is estranged and objective, or the annulling of objectivity in the form of estrangement ( which has to advance from indifferent foreignness to real, antagonistic estrangement) means equally or even primarily for Hegel that it is objectivity which is to be annulled, because it is not the determinate character of the object, but rather its objective character that is offensive and constitutes estrangement for self-consciousness. The object is therefore something negative, self¬annulling nullity. This nullity of the object has not only a negative but a positive meaning for consciousness, for such a nullity of the object is precisely the self•confirmation of the non• objectivity, of the abstraction of itself. For consciousness itself this nullity of the object has a positive meaning because it knows this nullity, the objective being, as its self-alienation; because it knows that it exists only as a result of its own self-alienation....
     The way in which consciousness is, and in which something is for it, is knowing. Knowing is its sale act. Something therefore comes to be for consciousness in so far as the latter knows this something. Knowing is its sale objective relation. Consciousness; then, knows the nullity of the object (i.e., knows the non-existence of the distinction between the object and itself, the non-existence of the object for it) because it knows the object as its self alienation; that is, it knows itself-knows knowing as the object-because the object is only the semblance of an object, a piece of mystification, which in its essence, however, is nothing else but knowing itself, which has confronted itself with itself and in so doing has confronted itself with a nullity-a something which has no objectivity outside the knowing. Or: knowing knows that in relating itself to an object it is only outside itself-that it only externalizes itself; that it itself appears to itself only as an object-or that that which appears to it as an object is only it itself.
     On the other hand, says Hegel, there is at the same time this other moment in this process, that consciousness has just as much annulled and superseded this externalization and objectivity and resumed them into itself, being thus at home in its other-being as such.
     In this discussion are brought together all the illusions of speculation.
     First of all: consciousness-self-consciousness-is at home with itself in its other-being as such. It is therefore-or if we here abstract from the Hegelian abstraction and put the self-consciousness of man instead of Self-consciousness-it is at home with itself in its other-being, as such. This implies, for one thing, that consciousness (knowing as knowing, thinking as thinking) pretends to be directly the other of itself-to be the world of sense, the real world, life-thought over-reaching itself in thought (Feuerbach).1 This aspect is contained herein, inasmuch as consciousness as mere consciousness takes offence not at estranged objectivity, but at objectivity as such.
     Secondly, this implies that self-conscious man, in so far as he has recognized and annulled and superseded the spiritual world (or his world's spiritual, general mode of being) as self-alienation, nevertheless again confirms this in its alienated shape and passes it off as his true mode of being-re-establishes it, and pretends to be at home in his other-being as such. Thus, for instance, after annulling and superseding religion, after recognizing religion to be a product of self-alienation, he yet finds confirmation of himself in religion as religion. Here is the root of Hegel's false positivism, or of his merely apparent criticism: this is what Feuerbach designated as the positing, negating and re-establishing of religion or theology-but it has to be grasped in more general terms. Thus reason is at home in unreason as unreason. The man who has recognized that he is leading an alienated life in politics, law, etc., is leading his true human life in this alienated life as such. Self-affirmation, in contradiction with itself-in contradiction both with the knowledge of and with the essential being of the object-is thus true knowledge and life.
     There can therefore no longer be any question about an act of accommodation on Hegel's part vis-à-visreligion, the state, etc.,since this lie is the lie of his principle.
     If I know religion as alienated human self-consciousness, then what I know in it as religion is not my self-consciousness, but my alienated self-consciousness confirmed in it. I therefore know my own self, the self-consciousness that belongs to its very nature, confirmed not in religion but rather in annihilated and superseded religion.
     In Hegel, therefore, the negation of the negation is not the confirmation of the true essence, effected precisely through negation of the pseudo-essence. With him the negation of the negation is the confirmation of the pseudo-essence, or of the self-estranged essence in its denial; or it is the denial of this pseudo-essence as an objective being dwelling outside man and independent of him, and its transformation into the subject.
     A peculiar role, therefore, is played by the act of superseding in which denial and preservation-denial and affirmation-are bound together.
     Thus, for example, in Hegel's Philosophy of Right, Private Right superseded equals Morality, Morality superseded equals the Family, the Family superseded equals Civil Society, Civil Society superseded equals the State, the State superseded equals World History. In the actual world private right, morality, the family, civil society, the state, etc., remain in existence, only they have become moments of man-state of his existence and being-which have no validity in isolation, but dissolve and engender one another, etc. They have become moments of motion.
     In their actual existence this mobile nature of theirs is hidden. It first appears and is made manifest in thought, in philosophy. Hence my true religious existence is my existence in the philosophy of religion; my true political existence is my existence within the philosophy of right; my true natural existence, existence in the philosophy of nature; my true artistic existence, existence in the philosophy of art; my true human existence, my existence in philosophy. Likewise the true existence of religion, the state, nature, art is, the philosophy of religion, of nature, of the state and of art. If, however, the philosophy of religion, etc., is for me the sole true existence of religion, then, too, it is only as a philosopher of religion that I am truly religious, and so I deny real religious sentiment and the really religious man. But at the same time I assert them, in part within my own existence or within the alien existence which I oppose to them-for this is only their philosophic expression-and in part I assert them in their own original shape, for they have validity for me as merely the apparent other-being, as allegories, forms of their own true existence ( i.e., of my philosophical existence) hidden under sensuous disguises.
     In just the same way, Quality superseded equals Quantity, Quantity superseded equals Measure, Measure superseded equalsEssence, Essence superseded equals Appearance, Appearance superseded equals Actuality, Actuality superseded equals the Concept, the Concept superseded equals Objectivity, Objectivity superseded equals the Absolute Idea, the Absolute Idea superseded equals Nature, Nature superseded equals Ethical Objective Mind, Ethical Mind superseded equals Art, Art superseded equals Religion, Religion superseded equals Absolute Knowledge.2
     On the one hand, this act of superseding is a transcending of the thought entity; th us, Private Property as a thought is transcended in the thought of morality. And because thought imagines itself to be directly the other of itself, to be sensuous reality-and therefore takes its own action for sensuous, real action-this superseding in thought, which leaves its object standing in the real world, believes that it has really overcome it. On the other hand, because the object has now become for it a moment of thought, thought takes it in its reality too to be self-confirmation of itself-of self• consciousness, of abstraction.
     From the one point of view the existent which Hegel supersedes in philosophy is therefore not real religion, the real state, or real nature, but religion itself already become an object of knowledge, i.c., Dogmatics; the same with Jurisprudence, Political Science and Natural Science. From the one point of view, therefore, he stands in opposition both to the real thing and to immediate, unphilosophic science or the unphilosophic conceptions of this thing. He therefore contradicts their conventional conceptions.3
     On the other hand, the religious man, etc., can find in Hegel his final confirmation.
     It is now time to lay hold of the positive aspects of the Hegelian dialectic within the realm of estrangement.
      (a) Annulling as an objective movement of retracting the alienation into self. This is the insight, expressed within the• estrangement, concerning the appropriation of the objective essence through the annulment of its estrangement; it is the estranged insight into the real objectification of man, into the real appropriation of his objective essence through the annihilation of the estranged character of the objective world, through the annulment of the objective world in its estranged mode of being-just as atheism, being the annulment of God, is the advent of theoretic humanism, and communism, as the annulment of private property, is the justification of real human life as man's possession and thus the advent of practical humanism (or just as atheism is humanism mediated with itself through the annulment of religion, whilst communism is humanism mediated with itself through the annulment of private property). Only through the annulment of this mediation-which is itself, however, a necessary premise-does positively self-deriving humanism, positive humanism, come into being.
     But atheism and communism are no flight, no abstraction; they are not a losing of the objective world begotten by man-of man's essential powers given over to the realm of objectivity; they are not a returning in poverty to unnatural, primitive simplicity. On the contrary, they are but the first real coming-to-be, the realization become real for man, of man's essence-of the essence of man as something real.
     Thus, by grasping the positive meaning of self-referred negation (if even again in estranged fashion) Hegel grasps man's self¬estrangement, the alienation of man's essence, man's loss of objectivity and his loss of realness as finding of self, change of his nature, his objectification and realization. In short, within the sphere of abstraction, Hegel conceives labour as man's act of self¬genesis-conceives man's relation to himself as an alien being and the manifesting of himself as an alien being to be the coming-to-be of species-consciousness and species-life.
      (b) However, apart from, or rather in consequence of, the perverseness already described, this act appears in Hegel:
     First of all as a merely formal, because abstract, act, because the human essence itself is taken to be only an abstract, thinking
essence, conceived merely as. self-consciousness. And,
     secondly, because the conception is formal and abstract, the annulment of the alienation becomes a confirmation of the alienation; or again, for Hegel this movement of self-genesis and self¬objectification in the form of self-alienation and self-estrangement is the absolute, and hence final, expression of human life-of life with itself as its aim, of life at rest in itself, of life that has attained oneness with its essence.
     This movement, in its abstract form as dialectic, is therefore regarded as truly human life, and because it is nevertheless an abstraction-an estrangement of human life-it is regarded as a divine process, but as the divine process of man, a process traversed by man's abstract, pure, absolute essence that is distinct from him.
     Thirdly, this process must have a bearer, a subject. But the subject first emerges as a result. This result-the subject knowing itself as absolute self-consciousness-is therefore God-absolute Spirit-the self-knowing and self-manifesting Idea. Real man and real nature become mere predicates-symbols of this esoteric, unreal man and of this unreal nature. Subject and predicate are therefore related to each other in absolute inversion-a mystical subject¬object or a subjectivity reaching beyond the object-the absolute subject as a process, as subject alienating itself and returning from alienation into itself, but at the same time retracting this alienationinto itself, and the subject as this process; a pure, restless revolving within itself.
     First, the formal and abstract conception of man's act of self¬genesis or self-objectification.
     Hegel having posited man as equivalent to self-consciousness, the estranged object-the estranged essential reality of man-is nothing but consciousness, the thought of estrangement merely¬estrangement's abstract and therefore empty and unreal expression, negation. The annulment of the alienation is therefore likewise nothing but an abstract, empty annulment of that empty abstraction-the negation of the negation. The rich, living, sensuous, concrete activity of self-objectification is therefore reduced to its mere abstraction, absolute negativity-an abstraction which is again fixed as such and thought of as an independent activity-as sheer activity. Because this so-called negativity is nothing but the abstract, empty form of that real living act, its content can in consequence be merely a formal content begotten by abstraction from all content. As a result there are general, abstract forms of abstraction pertaining to every content and on that account indifferent to, and, consequently, valid for, all content-the thought-forms or logical categories torn from real mind and from real nature. (We shall unfold the logical content of absolute negativity further on.)
     Hegel's positive achievement here, in his speculative logic, is that the determinate concepts, the universal fixed thought-forms in their independence vis-à-vis nature and mind are a necessary result of the general estrangement of the human essence and therefore also of human thought, and that Hegel has there-fore brought these together and presented them as moments of the abstraction¬process. For example, superseded Being is Essence, superseded Essence is Concept, the Concept superseded is ... the Absolute Idea. But what, then, is the Absolute Idea? It supersedes its own self again, if it does not want to traverse once more from the beginning the whole act of abstraction, and to acquiesce in being a totality of abstractions or in being the self-comprehending abstraction. But abstraction comprehending itself as abstraction knows itself to be nothing: it must abandon itself-abandon abstraction-and so it arrives at an entity which is its exact contrary -at nature. Thus, the entire Logic is the demonstration that abstract thought is nothing in itself; that the Absolute Idea is nothing in itself; that only Nature is something.
     The absolute idea, the abstract idea, which ""considered with regard to its unity with itself is intuiting,""4 ( Hegel's Encyclopaedia, 3rd edition, p. 222 ) , and which ""in its own absolute truth resolves to let the moment of its particularity or of initial characterization and other-being-the immediate idea, as its reflection, go forth freely from itself as nature"" (l.c.)-this whole idea which behaves in such a strange and singular way, and which has given the Hegelians such terrible headaches, is from beginning to end nothing else but abstraction ( i.e., the abstract thinker)¬abstraction which, made wise by experience and enlightened concerning its truth, resolves under various (false and themselves still abstract) conditions to abandon itself and to replace its self¬absorption, nothingness, generality and indeterminateness by its other-being, the particular, and the determinate; resolves to let nature, which it held hidden in itself only as an abstraction, as a thought-entity, go forth freely from itself: that is to say, abstraction resolves to forsake abstraction and to have a look at nature free of abstraction. The abstract idea, which without mediation becomes intuiting, is nothing else through-and-through but abstract thinking that gives itself up and resolves on intuition. This entire transition from Logic to Natural Philosophy is nothing else but the transition-so difficult to effect for the abstract thinker and therefore so queer in his description of it-from abstracting to intuiting. The mystical feeling which drives the philosopher forward from abstract thinking to intuiting is boredom-the longing for a content.
      ( The man estranged from himself is also the thinker estranged from his essence-that is, from the natural and human essence. His thoughts are therefore fixed mental shapes or ghosts dwelling outside nature and man. Hegel has locked up all these fixed mental forms together in his Logic, laying hold of each of them first as negation-that is, as an alienation of human thought-and then as negation of the negation-that is, as a superseding of this alienation, as a real expression of human thought. But as even this still takes place within the confines of the estrangement, this negation of the negation is in part the restoring of these fixed forms in their estrangement; in part a stopping-short at the last act-the act of self-reference in alienation-as the true mode of being of these fixed mental forms;5 and in part, to the extent that this abstraction apprehends itself and experiences an infinite weariness with itself, there makes its appearance in Hegel, in the formof the resolution to recognize nature as the essential being and to go over to intuition, the abandonment of abstract thought-the abandonment of thought revolving solely within the orbit of thought, of thought devoid of eyes, of teeth, of ears, of everything.)
     But nature too, taken abstractly, for itself-nature fixed in isolation from man-is nothing for man. It goes without saying that the abstract thinker who has committed himself to intuiting, intuits nature abstractly. Just as nature lay enclosed in the thinker in the form of the absolute idea, in the form of a thought-entity-in a shape which is his and yet is esoteric and mysterious even to him-so what he has let go forth from himself in truth is only this abstract nature, only nature as a thought-entity-but with the significance now of being the other-being of thought, of being real, intuited nature-of being nature distinguished from abstract thought. Or, to talk a human language, the abstract thinker learns in his intuition of nature that the entities which he thought to create from nothing, from pure abstraction-the entities he believed he was producing in the divine dialectic as pure products of the labour of thought forever weaving in itself and never looking outward-are nothing else but abstractions from characteristics of nature. To him, therefore, the whole of nature merely repeats the logical abstractions in a sensuous, external form . He analyses it and these abstractions over again. Thus, his intuition of nature is only the act of confirming his abstraction from the intuition of nature-is only the conscious repetition by him of the process of begetting his abstraction. Thus, for example, Time equals Negativity referred to itself (l.c., p. 238): to the superseded Becoming as Being there corresponds, in natural form, superseded Movement as Matter. Light is Reflection-in-Itself, in natural form. Body as Moon and Comet is the natural form of the antithesis which according to the Logic is on the one side the Positive resting on itself and on the other side the Negative resting on itself. The Earth is the natural form of the logical Ground, as the negative unity of the anti thesis, etc.
     Nature as nature-that is to say, in so far as it is still sensuously distinguished from that secret sense hidden within it-nature isolated, distinguished from these abstractions, is nothing-a nothing proving itself to be nothing-is devoid of sense, or has only the sense of being an externality which has to be annulled.
        &nb   ""In the finite-teleological position is to be found the correct
     premise that nature does not contain within itself the absolute purpose"" (p. 225 )
     Its purpose is the confirmation of abstraction.
            ""Nature has shown itself to be the Idea in the form of
      other-being. Since the Idea is in this form the negative of itself
      or external to itself, nature is not just relatively external vis-à-vis
      this idea, but externality constitutes the form in which it exists as nature"" (p. 227 ) .
      Externality here is not to be understood as the self-externalizing world of sense open to the light, open to the man endowed with senses. It is to be taken here in the sense of alienation-a mistake, a defect, which ought not to be. For what is true is still the Idea. Nature is only the form of the Idea's other-being. And since abstract thought is the essence, that which is external to it is by its essence something merely external. The abstract thinker recognizes at the same time that sensuousness-externality in contrast to thought weaving within itself-is the essence of nature. But he expresses his contrast in such a way as to make this externality of nature, its contrast to thought, its defect, so that inasmuch as it is distinguished from abstraction, nature is something defective. Something which is defective not merely for me or in my eyes but in itself-intrinsically-has something outside itself which it lacks. That is, its being is something other than it itself. Nature has therefore to supersede itself for the abstract thinker, for it is already posited by him as a potentially superseded being.
            ""For us, Mind has nature, for its premise, being nature's truth
      and for that reason its absolute prius. In this truth nature has vanished,
      and mind has resulted as the Idea arrived at being for-itself
      , the object of which, as well as the subject, is the con-
      cept. This identity is absolute negativity, for whereas in nature
      the concept has its perfect external objectivity, this its alienation
      has been superseded, and in this alienation the concept has
      become identical with itself. But it is this identity, therefore,
      in being a return out of nature"" (p. 392 ).
            ""As the abstract idea, revelation is unmediated transition to,
      the coming-to-be of, nature; as the revelation of the mind, which
      is free, it is the establishing of nature as the mind's world-an
      establishing which at the same time, being reflection, is a presupposing
      of the world as independently-existing nature. Revelation
      in conception is the creation of nature as the mind's being, in
      which the mind procures the affirmation and the truth of its
      freedom.""7 ""The absolute is mind. This is the highest definition
      of the absolute.""

I am indebted to Thomas Ferguson for bringing the crossed-out material to my attention.
1.Particularly.
2. Marx refers here to the Young Hegelian Bruno Bauer, who had published in Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung two long reviews dealing with books, articles and pamphlets on the Jewish question. Most of the quoted phrases are taken from these reviews in Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, vol. 1, December, 1843; vol. 4, March, 1844. The expressions ""utopian phrase"" and ""compact mass"" can be found in Bauer's article ""Was ist jetzt der Gegenstand der Kritik?"" published in Allgemeine Literatur-Zeitung, vol. 8, July, 1844. Allgemeine Literatuf-Zeitung  (General Literary Gazette), a German monthly, was published by Bauer in Charlottenburg from December, 1843, to October, 1844.
3. Passages enclosed in brackets were crossed out by Marx in his manuscript.

8.

It included Marx's Notes on the Latest Prussian Instruction to Censors and Luther-the Arbiter Between Strauss and Feuerbach, and articles by Bruno Bauer, Ludwig Feuerbach, Friedrich Koppen, Arnold Ruge, etc.
9. Marx has in mind Hauer and his followers, who were associated with the Allgemeine Lite,atur-Zeitung.
1. ""Moment"" is a technical term in Hegelian philosophy meaning a vital element of thought. The term is used to stress that thought is a process, and thus that elements in a system of thought are also phases in a movement.
2. In Hegel, ""feeling"" (Empfindung) denotes a relatively low form of mental life in which the subjective and the objective are still confused together ""Consciousness"" (Bewusstein)-the name given by Hegel to the first major section of his Phenomenology of Mind-denotes those forms of mental activity where a subject first seeks to comprehend an object. ""Self-consciousness"" and ""mind"" denote subsequent, higher phases in the evolution of ""absolute knowledge"" or ""the absolute.""
3. Die Entjremdete Arbeit. See the Note on Texts and Terminology. p. xli. above. for a discussion of this term. 
4. ""Alienation""-  EntiiusseTung
5. ""Species nature"" (and, earlier, ""species being"")- Gattungswesen; ""man's essential nature""- menschlichen Wesen.
6. At this point the first manuscript breaks off  unfinished.
7. Prostitution is only a specific expression of the general prostitution of the labourer, and since it is a relationship in which falls not the prostitute alone, but also the one who prostitutes-and the latter's abomination is still greater-the capitalist, etc., also comes under this head. 
8. For this reason it is just as highly priced as the determinations of human essence and activities. 
9. In practice I can relate myself to a thing humanly only if the thing relates itself to the human being humanly.

2. Spontaneous generation.

4. James Mill, Elements of Political Economy.
5. In the manuscript the lower left corner of the page is torn off. Just the right-hand endings of the last six lines remain, making restorations of the text impossible. It is possible to surmise, however, that Marx here criticizes Hegel's idealistic ""transcending"" of estrangement ( the words that have survived are cited in the next footnote ) .
6. In ""transcending"" estrangement ""in the old German manner-the manner of the Hegelian phenomenology,"" i.e., in transcending it exclusively in the ""consciousness"" of the subject.

9. Feuerbach views negation of negation, the definite concept as thinking surpassing itself in thinking and as thinking wanting to be directly awareness, nature, reality.  Marx is referring to Feuerbach's critical observations about Hegel in § 29-30 of his Grundsatze der Philosophie zer Zukunft.
1. What follows here are the main chapter and section-headings of Hegel's Phenomenology of Mind. Here and in later quotations from the Phenomenology, the translator has followed Baillie's translation very closely, departing from it only on the few occasions where this was necessary to keep the terminology in line with that used  throughout the present volume.
2. G. W. F. Hegel, Enzyklopadie der Philosophischen Wissenschaften (Heidelberg, 1st ed., 1817, 3 rd ed., 1830). Hegel's Encyclopaedia of the Philosophical Sciences is a single volume falling into three main parts : the subject of the first is Logic (c.f. The Logic of Hegel, trans. William Wallace. 2nd ed., Oxford, 1892 ); the subject of the second part is the Philosophy of Nature (of which no English translation has been published) , and that of the third .the Philosophy of Mind. (Cf. Hegel's Philosophy of Mind, trans. William Wallace, Oxford, 1894.)
3. ""The unhappy consciousness,"" etc.-forms of mind, and phases and factors in human history, distinguished and analysed in particular sections of  Hegel's Phenomenology.
4. The paragraph which follows is a transcript of the second and third paragraphs of the last chapter of Hegel's Phenomenology, trans. Baillie, 2nd ed, p. 789.
5. ""Externalization""-Entausserung
6. ""Substance""-Wesen
7. ""Being""-Wesen ; ""nature""-Natur; ""system""-Wesen; ""be-ing""-Sein.
8. ""To be sensuous is to suffer"" -Sinnlich sein ist leidend sein. Here ""to suffer"" should probably be understood in the sense of ""to undergo""-to be the object of another's action. Note the transition in the next sentence from Leiden (suffering) to leidenschaftlich (passionate).
9. Here Marx has taken the impersonal pronounes es(it) to represent Bewusstsein (consciousness) ; but it seems that Baillie is more correct in reading this as standing for Selbstbewusstsein (self-consciousness). In the first quotation of this passage (p. 114) Marx  simply uses es without specifying what it represents, and the translation has followed Baillie in interpreting it as ""self-consciousness."" In the present repetition of the passage, Marx's specification of the ""it"" as ""consciousness"" has been followed in the translation.
1. Marx refers to § 30 of Feuerbach's Grundsatze der Philosophie der Zukunft, which says: ""Hegel is a thinker who transcends himself in thinking.""
2. This sequence gives the major ""categories"" or ""thought-forms"" of Hegel's Encyclopaedia in the order in which they occur and are superseded. Similarly, the sequence• above from ""private right"" to ""world history"" gives the major categories of Hegel's Philosophy of Right in the order in which they appear there.
3. The conventional conception of theology, jurisprudence, political science, natural science, etc.
4. The Logic of Hegel, trans. Wallace, 244. ""Intuiting"" is here used to render Anschauen. In popular usage Anschauen means ""to contemplate,"" but Hegel is here using the word, like Kant, as a technical term in philosophy meaning, roughly, ""to be aware through the senses."" ""Intuiting,"" like-wise, should be understood here not in its popular sense but as the philosophical term which is the recognized English equivalent of Anschauen
5. This means that what Hegel does is to put in place of these fixed abstractions the act of abstraction which revolves in its own circle. In so doing, he has the merit, in the first place, of having indicated the source of all these inappropriate concepts which, as originally presented, belonged to disparate philosophies; of having brought them together; and of having created the entire compass of abstraction exhaustively set out as the object of criticism, instead of some specific  abstraction. (Why Hegel separates thought from the subject we shall see later: at this stage it is already clear, however, that when man is not, his characteristic expression also cannot be human, and so neither could thought be grasped as an expression of man as a human and natural subject endowed with eyes, ears, etc., and living in society, in the world, and in nature.) 
6. Time, Motion, Matter, Light, etc., are forms distinguished within Hegel's Philosophy of Nature. Becoming, etc., are of course categories of the Logic
7. Cf. Hegel's Philosophy of Mind, trans. Wallace, 381. But in rendering these passages from the Encyclopaedia, the present translator has not followed Wallace closely."

Todos quieren ser lo que ven en otro espejo
Y yo solo quiero ser yo mismo
Y ¿Sabes que? No me encuentro
Madre dame fuerzas para no cagarme en Dios y ser injusto
¿A mí que coño me importa los daños de tu corazón?
Si tengo el mío y no lo uso, ja!
¿A mí que coño me importa los daños de tu corazón?
Si tengo el mío y no lo uso
Por eso yo odio dormir solo
Despierto un domingo besando el suelo que piso
Pienso, pienso y no
Mejor te da el que no da nada
Que el que te da por cortesía, o peor, por pena
No me halaga el que se acerca a ver el panorama
Y no conoce ni una mierda de mi vida ni la suya
Yo por eso ya...
Yo ya aprendí que lo que se va no vuelve nunca
Echar de menos el viernes, el lunes
Que la familia es lo único que siempre dura
Con dos abuelos menos, dos ángeles más me cubren

Piden mi opinión, ya saben lo que pienso
Quieren que yo arregle el fallo que cometen ellos
Tú no pidas nada aquí si no estás dentro del círculo
Yo cuento los míos con los dedos de una mano
Así que...
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
¿Quieres hablar?
Te voy a enseñar las reglas del juego
Así que fuck you, fuck you, fuck you
Quieren hablar y no saben na'
P controla el juego, así que...

Tú creías que el tiempo te daría una receta
Para poder mirar atrás y no sentir más lástima
Pero yo no soy médico, chica, soy un poeta
La nostalgia me hace rico, y tú no estás en venta
Las calles son frías, la gente es fría
Mi sangre es fría, tú me hiciste así, tía
Me preocupa una mierda si te hice daño
Tú eres responsable de lo tuyo ya
Y el resto quémalo, el resto quémalo, estás solo
Sólo confío en el tío que me hace los coros
Salgo de noche y vuelvo de día
Y nada cambia porque nada cambiaría, pero

Piden mi opinión, ya saben lo que pienso
Quieren que yo arregle el fallo que cometen ellos
Tú no pidas nada aquí si no estás dentro del círculo
Yo cuento los míos con los dedos de una mano

139,149118158,Make No Plans,ANAK,[15],['R&B/Soul'],"I used to be a wise guy, now I’m not, I used to be a loud mouth, now I’m not
I used to be a big shot, now I’m not, I used to read the writing on the wall
Well I’ve been, dismembered and disemboweled, discombobulated
The Jersey devil tore my guts out, now I’ve resigned to suffocation
When this world gets weird for me, this new gnawing inside these lungs
Maybe this’ll all feel better later, ‘cept later never even seems to come
I used to be a wise guy, now I’m not, I used to be a smart ass, now I’m not
I used to be a burning boy, I used to read the writing on the wall
Twenty-two, so much to do, I never wanted to become a recluse
Curmudgeon, a hermit, still scared to say something stupid, too young to feel this way
Bruised and battered, who knew I was fragile, but I’ve never been more happy to be here, but
When everything gets so out of focus, it just gets harder and harder to care
And why's it feel like we’re always at square one, dealing with unexpected expenses, I’m
Still not convinced that I’ll move any mountains but, I'm still up to some big things, relentlessly
Locomotion, inside this brain, where I’m going, I just can't say
Locomotion, inside this brain, where I’m going, I just can't say
Be bold, be blunt, and by God just be honest
My hands move only for you, use this flesh while we've got it
Live simply and give love completely
With food, friends, music, beer, weed and whiskey
I’m still not sure where my old discerning eyes went
But this thing makes me feel beautiful
And I sure as shit wanna leave something here when I’m gone
So it’s time to make up my mind, it’s time to wake up and fight
I’m in love with everything and you’re no different
So I’ll awake from my slumber and chase this high ‘til I die
You can throw away all of your stuff but it still won’t change a thing
This won’t be forever, for better or worse
If you love something say it, if you love someone tell ‘em
Dust to dust, it’s all there is, it’ll come in time, it all does
But I’m either on the cusp of collapse or a breakthrough
On the brink of a breakdown
But maybe I’ll stick around to check out all the sights and smells
Just keep breathing in and out
It’s true that the first spark shines the brightest
And the first wound bleeds the most
Mountains and valleys, it all fits together somehow
And once you get a taste you’re hooked
Order and chaos, mischief managed and lesson learned
I guess things never truly change
You can’t escape yourself, we’re all alone in here
And we’re holding ourselves together
But I’m starting to see through the cracks
Clinging to life like a dead man walking
Ravage my body and savage my mind
I hope you haven’t grown sick of my voice yet
But birds keep nesting in my brain today
Strong deliberate hands, guide my way to the promised land, but
We don’t wanna take this chance, side by side, hear the jester dance, oh
Where we wanna go, where we wanna be, it’s beneath me
Where we wanna go, what we wanna see, well it beats me
Strong deliberate hands, hide my face, tucked behind them clasped, but
We don’t wanna make no plans, side by side, hear the jester dance, oh
Where we wanna go, where we wanna be, it’s beneath me
Where we wanna go, what we wanna see, well it beats me
They just drained the river again, I think I found a new low, again
They just drained the river again, I think I found a new low, again"

Salen don JUAN Tenorio e ISABELA, duquesa.

Salen don JUAN Tenorio e ISABELA,
duquesa

ISABELA:          Duque Octavio, por aquí
podrás salir más seguro.
JUAN:          Duquesa, de nuevo os juro
de cumplir el dulce sí.
ISABELA:          Mis glorias serán verdades
promesas y ofrecimientos,
regalos y cumplimientos,
voluntades y amistades.
JUAN:             Sí, mi bien.
ISABELA:                 Quiero sacar
una luz.
JUAN:                 ¿Pues, para qué?
ISABELA:       Para que el alma dé fe
del bien que llego a gozar.
JUAN:             Mataréte la luz yo.
ISABELA:       ¡Ah, cielo!  ¿Quién eres, hombre?
JUAN:          ¿Quién soy?  Un hombre sin nombre.
ISABELA:       ¿Que no eres el duque?
JUAN:                                 No.
ISABELA:          ¡Ah de palacio!
JUAN:                         Detente.
Dame, duquesa, la mano.
ISABELA:       No me detengas, villano.
¡Ah del rey!  ¡Soldados, gente!
Sale el REY de Nápoles, con una vela en un
candelero
REY:              ¿Qué es esto?
ISABELA:                     ¡El rey!  ¡Ay, triste,
REY:           ¿Quién eres?
JUAN:                       ¿Quién ha de ser?
Un hombre y una mujer.
REY:           (Esto en prudencia consiste.)      Aparte
¡Ah de mi guarda!  Prendé
a este hombre.
ISABELA:                 ¡Ay, perdido honor!
Vase ISABELA. Sale don PEDRO Tenorio, embajador de
España, y GUARDA

PEDRO:         ¿En tu cuarto, gran señor
voces?  ¿Quién la causa fue?
REY:              Don Pedro Tenorio, a vos
esta prisión os encargo,
siendo corto, andad vos largo.
Mirad quién son estos dos.
Y con secreto ha de ser,
que algún mal suceso creo;
porque si yo aquí los veo,
no me queda más que ver.
Vase el REY

PEDRO:            Prendedle.
JUAN:                    ¿Quién ha de osar?
Bien puedo perder la vida;
mas ha de ir tan bien vendida
que a alguno le ha de pesar.
PEDRO:            Matadle.
JUAN:                     ¿Quién os engaña?
Resuelto en morir estoy,
porque caballero soy,
del embajador de España.
Llegue; que, solo, ha de ser
él quien me rinda.
PEDRO:                          Apartad;
a ese cuarto os retirad
todos con esa mujer.
Vanse los otros

Ya estamos solos los dos;
muestra aquí tu esfuerzo y brío.
JUAN:          Aunque tengo esfuerzo, tío,
no le tengo para vos.
PEDRO:            Di quién eres.
JUAN:                            Ya lo digo.
Tu sobrino.
PEDRO:                   ¡Ay, corazón,
que temo alguna traición!
¿Qué es lo que has hecho, enemigo?
¿Cómo estás de aquesta suerte?
Dime presto lo que ha sido.
¡Desobediente, atrevido!
Estoy por darte la muerte.
Acaba.
JUAN:                    Tío y señor,
mozo soy y mozo fuiste;
y pues que de amor supiste,
tenga disculpa mi amor.
Y pues a decir me obligas
la verdad, oye y diréla.
Yo engañé y gocé a Isabela
la duquesa.
PEDRO:                   No prosigas.
Tente.  ¿Cómo la engañaste?
Habla quedo, y cierra el labio.
JUAN:          Fingí ser el duque Octavio.
PEDRO:         No digas más.  ¡Calla!  ¡Baste!
(Perdido soy si el rey sabe     Aparte
este caso.  ¿Qué he de hacer?
Industria me ha de valer
en un negocio tan grave.)
Di, vil, ¿no bastó emprender
con ira y fiereza extraña
tan gran traición en España
con otra noble mujer,
sino en Nápoles también,
y en el palacio real
con mujer tan principal?
¡Castíguete el cielo, amén!
Tu padre desde Castilla
a Nápoles te envió,
y en sus márgenes te dio
tierra la espumosa orilla
del mar de Italia, atendiendo
que el haberte recibido
pagaras agradecido,
y estás su honor ofendiendo.
¡Y en tan principal mujer!
Pero en aquesta ocasión
nos daña la dilación.
Mira qué quieres hacer.
JUAN:             No quiero daros disculpa,
que la habré de dar siniestra.
Mi sangre es, señor, la vuestra;
sacadla, y pague la culpa.
A esos pies estoy rendido,
y ésta es mi espada, señor.
PEDRO:         Alzate, y muestra valor,
que esa humildad me ha vencido.
¿Atreveráste a bajar
por ese balcón?
JUAN:                         Sí atrevo,
que alas en tu favor llevo.
PEDRO:         Pues yo te quiero ayudar.
Vete a Sicilia o Milán,
donde vivas encubierto.
JUAN:          Luego me iré.
PEDRO:                      ¿Cierto?
JUAN:                               Cierto.
PEDRO:         Mis cartas te avisarán
en qué para este suceso
triste, que causado has.
JUAN:          Para mí alegre dirás.
Que tuve culpa confieso.
PEDRO:            Esa mocedad te engaña.
Baja, pues, ese balcón.
JUAN:          (Con tan justa pretensión,
gozoso me parto a España).
Vase don JUAN y entra el REY

PEDRO:            Ejecutando, señor,
tu justicia justa y recta,
el hombre...
REY:                       ¿Murió?
PEDRO:                            ...escapóse
de las cuchillas soberbias.
REY:           ¿De qué forma?
PEDRO:                       De esta forma:
aun no lo mandaste apenas,
cuando, sin dar más disculpa,
la espada en la mano aprieta,
revuelve la capa al brazo,
y con gallarda presteza,
ofendiendo a los soldados
y buscando su defensa,
viendo vecina la muerte,
por el balcón de la huerta
se arroja desesperado.
Siguióle con diligencia
tu gente.  Cuando salieron
por esa vecina puerta,
le hallaron agonizando
como enroscada culebra.
Levantóse, y al decir
los soldados, ""¡Muera, muera!"",
bañado de sangre el rostro,
con tan heroica presteza
se fue, que quedé confuso.
La mujer, que es Isabela,
--que para admirarte nombro--
retirada en esa pieza,
dice que fue el duque Octavio
quien, con engaño y cautela,
la gozó.
REY:                     ¿Qué dices?
PEDRO:                              Digo
lo que ella propia confiesa.
REY:           ¡Ah, pobre honor!  Si eres alma
del hombre, ¿por qué te dejan
en la mujer inconstante,
si es la misma ligereza?
¡Hola!
Sale un CRIADO

CRIADO:              ¿Gran señor?
REY:                               Traed
delante de mi presencia
esa mujer.
PEDRO:                  Ya la guardia
viene, gran señor, con ella.
Trae la GUARDA a ISABELA

ISABELA:       (¿Con qué ojos veré al rey?)
REY:           Idos, y guardad la puerta
de esa cuadra.  Di, mujer,
¿qué rigor, qué airada estrella
te incitó, que en mi palacio,
con hermosura y soberbia,
profanases sus umbrales?
ISABELA:       Señor...
REY:                Calla, que la lengua
no podrá dorar el yerro
que has cometido en mi ofensa.
¡Aquél era del duque Octavio!
ISABELA:       ¡Señor!
REY:                   No, no importan fuerzas,
guardas, crïados, murallas,
fortalecidas almenas,
para Amor, que la de un niño
hasta los muros penetra.
Don Pedro Tenorio, al punto
a esa mujer llevad presa
a una torre, y con secreto
haced que al duque le prendan;
que quiero hacer que le cumpla
la palabra, o la promesa.
ISABELA:       Gran señor, ¡volvedme el rostro!
REY:           Ofensa a mi espalda hecha,
es justicia y es razón
castigarla a espaldas vueltas.
Vase el REY

PEDRO:         Vamos, duquesa.
ISABELA:                      (Mi culpa           Aparte
no hay disculpa que la venza,
mas no será el yerro tanto
si el duque Octavio lo enmienda).
Vanse todos.  Salen el duque OCTAVIO, y RIPIO su
criado

RIPIO:            ¿Tan de mañana, señor,
te levantas?
OCTAVIO:                    No hay sosiego
que pueda apagar el fuego
que enciende en mi alma Amor.
Porque, como al fin es niño,
no apetece cama blanda,
entre regalada holanda,
cubierta de blanco armiño.
Acuéstase.  No sosiega.
Siempre quiere madrugar
por levantarse a jugar,
que al fin como niño juega.
Pensamientos de Isabela
me tienen, amigo, en calma;
que como vive en el alma,
anda el cuerpo siempre en vela,
guardando ausente y presente,
el castillo del honor.
RIPIO:         Perdóname, que tu amor
es amor impertinente.
OCTAVIO:          ¿Qué dices, necio?
RIPIO:                                Esto digo,
impertinencia es amar
como amas.  ¿Vas a escuchar?
OCTAVIO:       Sí, prosigue.
RIPIO:                      Ya prosigo.
¿Quiérete Isabela a ti
OCTAVIO:       ¿Eso, necio, has de dudar?
RIPIO:         No, mas quiero preguntar,
¿Y tú no la quieres?
OCTAVIO:                             Sí.
RIPIO:            Pues, ¿no seré majadero,
y de solar conocido,
si pierdo yo mi sentido
por quien me quiere y la quiero?
Si ella a ti no te quisiera,
fuera bien el porfïarla,
regalarla y adorarla,
y aguardar que se rindiera;
mas si los dos os queréis
con una mesma igualdad,
dime, ¿hay más dificultad
de que luego os desposéis?
OCTAVIO:          Eso fuera, necio, a ser
de lacayo o lavandera
la boda.
RIPIO:               ¿Pues, es quienquiera
una lavandriz mujer,
lavando y fregatrizando,
defendiendo y ofendiendo,
los paños suyos tendiendo,
regalando y remendando?
Dando, dije, porque al dar
no hay cosa que se le iguale,
y si no, a Isabela dale,
a ver si sabe tomar.
Sale un CRIADO

CRIADO:           El embajador de España
en este punto se apea
en el zaguán, y desea,
con ira y fiereza extraña,
hablarte, y si no entendí
yo mal, entiendo es prisión.
OCTAVIO:       ¿Prisión?  Pues, ¿por qué ocasión?
Decid que entre.
Entra Don PEDRO Tenorio con guardas

PEDRO:                          Quien así
con tanto descuido duerme,
limpia tiene la conciencia.
OCTAVIO:       Cuando viene vueselencia
a honrarme y favorecerme,
no es justo que duerma yo.
Velaré toda mi vida.
¿A qué y por qué es la venida?
PEDRO:         Porque aquí el rey me envió.
OCTAVIO:          Si el rey mi señor se acuerda
de mí en aquesta ocasión,
será justicia y razón
que por él la vida pierda.
Decidme, señor, qué dicha
o qué estrella me ha guïado,
que de mí el rey se ha acordado?
PEDRO:         Fue, duque, vuestra desdicha.
Embajador del rey soy.
De él os traigo una embajada.
OCTAVIO:       Marqués, no me inquieta nada.
Decid, que aguardando estoy.
PEDRO:            A prenderos me ha envïado
el rey.  No os alborotéis.
OCTAVIO:       ¿Vos por el rey me prendéis?
Pues, ¿en qué he sido culpado?
PEDRO:            Mejor lo sabéis que yo,
mas, por si acaso me engaño,
escuchad el desengaño,
y a lo que el rey me envió.
Cuando los negros gigantes,
plegando funestos toldos
ya del crepúsculo huían,
tropezando unos en otros,
estando yo con su alteza
tratando ciertos negocios
porque antípodas del sol
son siempre los poderosos,
voces de mujer oímos,
cuyos ecos menos roncos,
por los artesones sacros
nos repitieron ""¡Socorro!""
A las voces y al rüido
acudió, duque, el rey propio,
halló a Isabela en los brazos
de algún hombre poderoso;
mas quien al cielo se atreve
sin duda es gigante o monstruo.
Mandó el rey que los prendiera,
quedé con el hombre solo.
Llegué y quise desarmarle,
pero pienso que el demonio
en él tomó forma humana,
pues que, vuelto en humo, y polvo,
se arrojó por los balcones,
entre los pies de esos olmos,
que coronan del palacio
los chapiteles hermosos.
Hice prender la duquesa,
y en la presencia de todos
dice que es el duque Octavio
el que con mano de esposo
la gozó.
OCTAVIO:               ¿Qué dices?
PEDRO:                             Digo
lo que al mundo es ya notorio,
y que tan claro se sabe,
que a Isabela, por mil modos,
[presa, ya lo ha dicho al rey.
Con vos, señor, o con otro,
esta noche en el palacio,
la habemos hallado todos.
OCTAVIO:          Dejadme, no me digáis
tan gran traición de Isabela,
mas... ¿si fue su amor cautela?
Proseguid, ¿por qué calláis?
(Mas, si veneno me dais
que a un firme corazón toca,
y así a decir me provoca
que imita a la comadreja,
que concibe por la oreja,
para parir por la boca.
¿Será verdad que Isabela,
alma, se olvidó de mí
para darme muerte?  Sí,
que el bien suena y el mal vuela.
Ya el pecho nada recela,
juzgando si son antojos,
que por darme más enojos,
al entendimiento entró,
y por la oreja escuchó,
lo que acreditan los ojos.)
Señor marqués, ¿es posible
que Isabela me ha engañado,
y que mi amor ha burlado?
¡Parece cosa imposible!
¡Oh mujer, ley tan terrible
de honor, a quien me provoco
a emprender!  Mas ya no toco
en tu honor esta cautela.
¿Anoche con Isabela
hombre en palacio?  ¡Estoy loco!
PEDRO:            Como es verdad que en los vientos
hay aves, en el mar peces,
que participan a veces
de todos cuatro elementos;
como en la gloria hay contentos,
lealtad en el buen amigo,
traición en el enemigo,
en la noche oscuridad,
y en el día claridad,
y así es verdad lo que digo.
OCTAVIO:          Marqués, yo os quiero creer,
no hay ya cosa que me espante,
que la mujer más constante
es, en efecto, mujer.
No me queda más que ver,
pues es patente mi agravio.
PEDRO:         Pues que sois prudente y sabio
elegid el mejor medio.
OCTAVIO:       Ausentarme es mi remedio.
PEDRO:         Pues sea presto, duque Octavio.
OCTAVIO:          Embarcarme quiero a España,
y darle a mis males fin.
PEDRO:         Por la puerta del jardín,
duque, esta prisión se engaña.
OCTAVIO:       ¡Ah veleta, ah débil caña!
A más furor me provoco,
y extrañas provincias toco,
huyendo de esta cautela.
Patria, adiós.  ¿Con Isabela
hombre en palacio?  ¡Estoy loco!
Vanse todos.  Sale TISBEA, pescadora, con una
caña de pescar en la mano

TISBEA:           Yo, de cuantas el mar,
pies de jazmín y rosa,
en sus riberas besa
con fugitivas olas,
sola de amor exenta,
como en ventura sola,
tirana me reservo
de sus prisiones locas.
Aquí donde el sol pisa
soñolientas las ondas,
alegrando zafiros
las que espantaba sombras,
por la menuda arena,
unas veces aljófar,
y átomos otras veces
del sol, que así le adora,
oyendo de las aves
las quejas amorosas,
y los combates dulces
del agua entre las rocas,
ya con la sutil caña,
que el débil peso dobla
del necio pececillo,
que el mar salado azota,
o ya con la atarraya,
que en sus moradas hondas
prenden cuantos habitan
aposentos de conchas,
seguramente tengo,
que en libertad se goza
el alma, que, Amor áspid
no le ofende ponzoña.
En pequeñuelo esquife,
y ya en compañía de otras,
tal vez al mar le peino
la cabeza espumosa.
Y cuando más perdidas
querellas de Amor forman,
como de todos río
envidia soy de todas.
Dichosa yo mil veces,
Amor, pues me perdonas,
si ya por ser humilde
no desprecias mi choza.
Obeliscos de paja
mi edificio coronan,
nidos; si no, hay cigarras
o tortolillas locas.
Mi honor conservo en pajas
como fruta sabrosa,
vidrio guardado en ellas
para que no se rompa.
De cuantos pescadores
con fuego Tarragona
de piratas defiende
en la argentada costa,
desprecio soy, encanto,
a sus suspiros sorda,
a sus ruegos terrible,
a sus promesas roca.
Anfriso, a quien el cielo,
con mano poderosa,
prodigió, en cuerpo y alma,
dotado en gracias todas,
medido en las palabras,
liberal en las obras,
sufrido en los desdenes,
modesto en las congojas,
mis pajizos umbrales,
que heladas noches ronda,
a pesar de los tiempos
las mañanas remoza,
pues ya con ramos verdes,
que de los olmos corta,
mis pajas amanecen
ceñidas de lisonjas,
ya con vigüelas dulces,
y sutiles zampoñas,
músicas me consagra,
y todo no le importa,
porque en tirano imperio
vivo de Amor señora,
que halla gusto en sus penas,
y en sus infiernos gloria.
Todas por él se mueren,
y yo, todas las horas,
le mato con desdenes,
de Amor condición propia;
querer donde aborrecen,
despreciar donde adoran,
que si le alegran muere,
y vive si le oprobian.
En tan alegre día,
segura de lisonjas,
mis juveniles años
Amor no los malogra;
que en edad tan florida,
Amor, no es suerte poca,
no ver, tratando en redes,
las tuyas amorosas.
Pero, necio discurso,
que mi ejercicio estorbas,
en él no me diviertas
en cosa que no importa.
Quiero entregar la caña
al viento, y a la boca
del pececillo el cebo.
¡Pero al agua se arrojan
dos hombres de una nave,
antes que el mar la sorba,
que sobre el agua viene,
y en un escollo aborda!
Como hermoso pavón
hace las velas cola,
adonde los pilotos
todos los ojos pongan.
Las olas va escarbando,
y ya su orgullo y pompa
casi la desvanece,
agua un costado toma.
Hundióse, y dejó al viento
la gavia, que la escoja
para morada suya,
que un loco en gavias mora.
Dentro gritos de ""¡Que me ahogo!""

Un hombre al otro aguarda,
que dice que se ahoga.
¡Gallarda cortesía,
en los hombros le toma!
Anquises le hace Eneas
si el mar está hecho Troya.
Ya nadando, las aguas
con valentía corta,
y en la playa no veo
quien le ampare y socorra.
Daré voces.  ¡Tirseo,
Anfriso, Alfredo, hola!
Pescadores me miran,
plega a Dios que me oigan,
mas milagrosamente
ya tierra los dos toman,
sin aliento el que nada,
con vida el que le estorba.
Saca en brazos CATALINÓN a don JUAN, mojados

CATALINÓN:        ¡Válgame la Cananea,
y qué salado es el mar!
Aquí puede bien nadar
el que salvarse desea,
que allá dentro es desatino
donde la muerte se fragua.
Donde Dios juntó tanta agua
¿no juntara tanto vino?
Agua, y salada.  Extremada
cosa para quien no pesca.
Si es mala aun el agua fresca,
¿qué será el agua salada?
¡Oh, quién hallara una fragua
de vino, aunque algo encendido!
Si del agua que he bebido
hoy escapo, no más agua.
Desde hoy abrenuncio de ella,
que la devoción me quita
tanto, que aun agua bendita
no pienso ver, por no vella.
¡Ah señor!  Helado y frío
está.  ¿Si estará ya muerto?
Del mar fue este desconcierto,
y mío este desvarío.
¡Mal haya aquél que primero
pinos en el mar sembró
y el que sus rumbos midió
con quebradizo madero!
¡Maldito sea el vil sastre
que cosió el mar que dibuja
con astronómica aguja,
causando tanto desastre!
¡Maldito sea Jasón,
y Tifis maldito sea!
Muerto está.  No hay quien lo crea.
¡Mísero Catalinón!
¿Qué he de hacer?
TISBEA:                             Hombre, ¿qué tienes?
CATALINÓN:     En desventura iguales,
pescadora, muchos males,
y falta de muchos bienes.
Veo, por librarme a mí,
sin vida a mi señor.  Mira
si es verdad.
TISBEA:                       No, que aun respira.
CATALINÓN:     ¿Por dónde, por aquí?
TISBEA:                             Sí,
pues, ¿por dónde...?
CATALINÓN:                           Bien podía
respirar por otra parte.
TISBEA:        Necio estás.
CATALINÓN:                   Quiero besarte
las manos de nieve fría.
TISBEA:           Ve a llamar los pescadores
que en aquella choza están.
CATALINÓN:     ¿Y si los llamo, ¿vendrán?
TISBEA:        Vendrán presto, no lo ignores.
¿Quién es este caballero?
CATALINÓN:     Es hijo aqueste señor
del camarero mayor
del rey, por quien ser espero
antes de seis días conde
en Sevilla, a donde va,
y adonde su alteza está,
si a mi amistad corresponde.
TISBEA:           ¿Cómo se llama?

CATALINÓN:                        Don Juan
Tenorio.
TISBEA:                 Llama mi gente.

CATALINÓN:     Ya voy.
Vase CATALINÓN.  Coge en el regazo TISBEA a don JUAN

TISBEA:              Mancebo excelente,
gallardo, noble y galán.
Volved en vos, caballero.
JUAN:          ¿Dónde estoy?
TISBEA:                     Ya podéis ver,
en brazos de una mujer.
JUAN:          Vivo en vos, si en el mar muero.
Ya perdí todo el recelo
que me pudiera anegar,
pues del infierno del mar
salgo a vuestro claro cielo.
Un espantoso huracán
dio con mi nave al través,
para arrojarme a esos pies,
que abrigo y puerto me dan,
y en vuestro divino oriente
renazco, y no hay que espantar,
pues veis que hay de amar a mar
una letra solamente.
TISBEA:           ¡Muy grande aliento tenéis
para venir soñoliento,
y más de tanto tormento!
Mucho contento ofrecéis;
pero si es tormento el mar,
y son sus ondas crüeles,
la fuerza de los cordeles,
pienso que os hacen hablar.
Sin duda que habéis bebido
del mar la oración pasada,
pues por ser de agua salada
con tan grande sal ha sido.
Mucho habláis cuando no habláis,
y cuando muerto venís,
mucho al parecer sentís,
¡plega a Dios que no mintáis!
Parecéis caballo griego,
que el mar a mis pies desagua,
pues venís formado de agua,
y estáis preñado de fuego.
Y si mojado abrasáis,
estando enjuto, ¿qué haréis?
Mucho fuego prometéis,
¡plega a Dios que no mintáis!
JUAN:             A Dios, zagala, pluguiera
que en el agua me anegara,
para que cuerdo acabara,
y loco en vos no muriera;
que el mar pudiera anegarme
entre sus olas de plata,
que sus límites desata,
mas no pudiera abrasarme.
Gran parte del sol mostráis,
pues que el sol os da licencia,
pues sólo con la apariencia,
siendo de nieve abrasáis.
TISBEA:           Por más helado que estáis,
tanto fuego en vos tenéis,
que en este mío os ardéis,
¡plega a Dios que no mintáis!
Salen CATALINÓN, CORIDÓN y ANFRISO,
pescadores

CATALINÓN:        Ya vienen todos aquí.
TISBEA:        Y ya está tu dueño vivo.
JUAN:          Con tu presencia recibo
el aliento que perdí.
CORIDÓN:          ¿Qué nos mandas?
TISBEA:                           Coridón,
Anfriso, amigos...
CORIDÓN:                        Todos
buscamos por varios modos
esta dichosa ocasión.
Di lo que mandas, Tisbea,
que por labios de clavel
no lo habrás mandado a aquél
que idolatrarte desea,
apenas, cuando al momento,
sin reservar en llano o sierra,
surque el mar, tale la tierra,
pise el fuego, el aire, el viento.
TISBEA:           (¡Oh, qué mal me parecía        Aparte
estas lisonjas ayer,
y hoy echo en ellas de ver
que sus labios no mentían!)
Estando, amigos, pescando
sobre este peñasco, vi
hundirse una nave allí,
y entre las olas nadando
dos hombres, y compasiva
di voces que nadie oyó;
y en tanta aflicción llegó
libre de la furia esquiva
del mar, sin vida a la arena,
de éste en los hombros cargado,
un hidalgo, ya anegado;
y envuelta en tan triste pena,
a llamaros envïé.
ANFRISO:       Pues aquí todos estamos,
manda que tu gusto hagamos,
lo que pensado no fue.
TISBEA:           Que a mi choza los llevemos
quiero, donde agradecidos
reparemos sus vestidos,
y a ellos los regalemos,
que mi padre gusta mucho
de esta debida piedad.
CATALINÓN:     Extremada es su beldad.
JUAN:          Escucha aparte.
CATALINÓN:                  Ya escucho.
JUAN:             Si te pregunta quién soy,
di que no sabes.
CATALINÓN:                   ¿A mí
quieres advertirme aquí
lo que he de hacer?
JUAN:                             Muerto voy
por la hermosa pescadora.
Esta noche he de gozalla.
CATALINÓN:     ¿De qué suerte?
JUAN:                         Ven y calla.
CORIDÓN:       Anfriso, dentro de un hora
que canten y bailen.
ANFRISO:                           Vamos,
y esta noche nos hagamos
rajas, y palos también.
JUAN:             Muerto soy.
TISBEA:                      ¿Cómo, si andáis?
JUAN:          Ando en pena, como veis.
TISBEA:        Mucho habláis.
JUAN:                       ¡Mucho encendéis!
TISBEA:        ¡Plega a Dios que no mintáis!
Vanse todos.  Salen don GONZALO de
Ulloa y el REY don Alfonso de Castilla

REY:              ¿Cómo os ha sucedido en la embajada,
comendador mayor?
GONZALO:                         Hallé en Lisboa
al rey don Juan, tu primo, previniendo
treinta naves de armada.
REY:                                  ¿Y para dónde?
GONZALO:       Para Goa me dijo, mas yo entiendo
que a otra empresa más fácil apercibe;
a Ceuta, o Tánger pienso que pretende
cercar este verano.
REY:                              Dios le ayude,
y premie el cielo de aumentar su gloria.
¿Qué es lo que concertasteis?
GONZALO:                                   Señor, pide
a Cerpa, y Mora, y Olivencia, y Toro,
y por eso te vuelve a Villaverde,
al Almendral, a Mértola, y Herrera
entre Castilla y Portugal.
REY:                                    Al punto
se firman los conciertos, don Gonzalo;
mas decidme primero cómo ha ido
en el camino, que vendréis cansado,
y alcanzado también.
GONZALO:                          Para serviros,
nunca, señor, me canso.
REY:                                ¿Es buena tierra
Lisboa?
GONZALO:             La mayor ciudad de España.
Y si mandas que diga lo que he visto
de lo exterior y célebre, en un punto
en tu presencia te podré un retrato.
REY:           Gustaré de oírlo.  Dadme silla.
GONZALO:       Es Lisboa una octava maravilla.
De las entrañas de España,
que son las tierras de Cuenca,
nace el caudaloso Tajo,
que media España atraviesa.
Entra en el mar Oceano,
en las sagradas riberas
de esta ciudad por la parte
del sur; mas antes que pierda
su curso y su claro nombre
hace un cuarto entre dos sierras
donde están de todo el orbe
barcas, naves, caravelas.
Hay galeras y saetías,
tantas que desde la tierra
para una gran ciudad
adonde Neptuno reina.
A la parte del poniente,
guardan del puerto dos fuerzas,
de Cascaes y Sangián,
las más fuertes de la tierra.
Está de esta gran ciudad,
poco más de media legua,
Belén, convento del santo
conocido por la piedra
y por el león de guarda,
donde los reyes y reinas,
católicos y cristianos,
tienen sus casas perpetuas.
Luego esta máquina insigne,
desde Alcántara comienza
una gran legua a tenderse
al convento de Lobregas.
En medio está el valle hermoso
coronado de tres cuestas,
que quedara corto Apeles
cuando pintarlas quisiera,
porque miradas de lejos
parecen piñas de perlas,
que están pendientes del cielo,
en cuya grandeza inmensa
se ven diez Romas cifradas
en conventos y en iglesias,
en edificios y calles,
en solares y encomiendas,
en las letras y en las armas,
en la justicia tan recta,
y en una Misericordia,
que está honrando su ribera,
y pudiera honrar a España,
y aun enseñar a tenerla.
Y en lo que yo más alabo
de esta máquina soberbia,
es que del mismo castillo,
en distancia de seis leguas,
se ven sesenta lugares
que llega el mar a sus puertas,
uno de los cuales es
el Convento de Odivelas,
en el cual vi por mis ojos
seiscientas y treinta celdas,
y entre monjas y beatas,
pasan de mil y doscientas.
Tiene desde allí a Lisboa,
en distancia muy pequeña,
mil y ciento y treinta quintas,
que en nuestra provincia Bética
llaman cortijos, y todas
con sus huertos y alamedas.
En medio de la ciudad
hay una plaza soberbia,
que se llama del Ruzío,
grande, hermosa, y bien dispuesta,
que habrá cien años y aun más
que el mar bañaba su arena,
y agora de ella a la mar,
hay treinta mil casas hechas,
que, perdiendo el mar su curso,
se tendió a partes diversas.
Tiene una calle que llaman
Rúa Nova, o calle nueva,
donde se cifra el oriente
en grandezas y riquezas,
tanto que el rey me contó
que hay un mercader en ella,
que por no poder contarlo,
mide el dinero a fanegas.
El terrero, donde tiene
Portugal su casa regia
tiene infinitos navíos,
varados siempre en la tierra,
de sólo cebada y trigo,
de Francia y Ingalaterra.
Pues, el palacio real,
que el Tajo sus manos besa,
es edificio de Ulises,
que basta para grandeza,
de quien toma la ciudad
nombre en la latina lengua,
llamándose Ulisibona,
cuyas armas son la esfera,
por pedestal de las llagas,
que, en la batalla sangrienta,
al rey don Alfonso Enríquez
dio la majestad inmensa.
Tiene en su gran Tarazana
diversas naves, y entre ellas
las naves de la conquista,
tan grandes que, de la tierra
miradas, juzgan los hombres
que tocan en las estrellas.
Y lo que de esta ciudad
te cuento por excelencia,
es, que estando sus vecinos
comiendo, desde las mesas,
ven los copos del pescado
que junto a sus puertas pescan
que, bullendo entre las redes,
vienen a entrarse por ellas.
Y sobre todo el llegar
cada tarde a su ribera
más de mil barcos cargados
de mercancías diversas,
y de sustento ordinario,
pan, aceite, vino y leña,
frutas de infinita suerte,
nieve de sierra de Estrella,
que por las calles a gritos,
puesta sobre las cabezas,
la venden; mas, ¿qué me canso?,
porque es contar las estrellas,
querer contar una parte
de la ciudad opulenta.
Ciento y treinta mil vecinos
tiene, gran señor, por cuenta,
y por no cansarte más,
un rey que tus manos besa.
REY:           Más estimo, don Gonzalo,
escuchar de vuestra lengua
esa relación sucinta,
que haber visto su grandeza.
¿Tenéis hijos?
GONZALO:                      Gran señor,
una hija hermosa y bella,
en cuyo rostro divino
se esmeró naturaleza.
REY:           Pues yo os la quiero casar
de mi mano.
GONZALO:                   Como sea
tu gusto, digo, señor,
que yo la acepto por ella;
pero ¿quién es el esposo?
REY:           Aunque no está en esta tierra,
es de Sevilla, y se llama
don Juan Tenorio.
GONZALO:                         Las nuevas
voy a llevar a doña Ana.

REY:           Id en buena hora, y volved,
Gonzalo, con la respuesta.
Vanse todos.  Salen don JUAN Tenorio y
CATALINÓN

JUAN:             Esas dos yeguas prevén,
pues acomodadas son.
CATALINÓN:     Aunque soy Catalinón,
soy, señor, hombre de bien,
que no se dijo por mí,
""Catalinón es el hombre"",
que sabes que aquese nombre
me asienta al revés aquí.
JUAN:              Mientras que los pescadores
van de regocijo y fiesta,
tú las dos yeguas apresta,
que de sus pies voladores,
sólo nuestro engaño fío.
CATALINÓN:     ¿Al fin pretendes gozar
a Tisbea?

JUAN:                    Si el burlar
es hábito antiguo mío,
¿qué me preguntas, sabiendo
mi condición?
CATALINÓN:                   Ya sé que eres
castigo de las mujeres.
JUAN:          Por Tisbea estoy muriendo,
que es buena moza.
CATALINÓN:                          Buen pago
a su hospedaje deseas.
JUAN:          Necio, lo mismo hizo Eneas
con la reina de Cartago.
CATALINÓN:        Los que fingís y engañáis
las mujeres de esa suerte,
lo pagaréis en la muerte.
JUAN:          ¡Qué largo me lo fiáis!
Catalinón con razón
te llaman.
CATALINÓN:                Tus pareceres
sigue, que en burlar mujeres
quiero ser Catalinón.
Ya viene la desdichada.
JUAN:          Vete, y las yeguas prevén.
CATALINÓN:     (Pobre mujer, harto bien
te pagamos la posada.)
Vase CATALINÓN y sale TISBEA

TISBEA:           El rato que sin ti estoy
estoy ajena de mí.
JUAN:          Por lo que finges ansí,
ningún crédito te doy.
TISBEA:           ¿Por qué?

JUAN:                      Porque si me amaras
mi alma favorecieras.
TISBEA:        Tuya soy.
JUAN:                     Pues, di, ¿qué esperas?
¿O en qué, señora, reparas?
TISBEA:           Reparo en que fue castigo
de Amor el que he hallado en ti.
JUAN:          Si vivo, mi bien, en ti,
a cualquier cosa me obligo.
Aunque yo sepa perder
en tu servicio la vida,
la diera por bien perdida,
y te prometo de ser
tu esposo.
TISBEA:                      Soy desigual
a tu ser.
JUAN:                    Amor es rey
que iguala con justa ley
la seda con el sayal.
TISBEA:           Casi te quiero creer,
mas sois los hombres traidores.
JUAN:          ¿Posible es, mi bien, que ignores
mi amoroso proceder?
Hoy prendes con tus cabellos
mi alma.
TISBEA:                 Ya a ti me allano,
bajo la palabra y mano
de esposo.
JUAN:                      Juro, ojos bellos,
que mirando me matáis,
de ser vuestro esposo.
TISBEA:                             Advierte,
mi bien, que hay Dios y que hay muerte.
JUAN:          ¡Qué largo me lo fiáis!
Ojos bellos, mientras viva
yo vuestro esclavo seré,
ésta es mi mano y mi fe.
TISBEA:        No seré en pagarte esquiva.
JUAN:             Ya en mí mismo no sosiego.
TISBEA:        Ven, y será la cabaña
del amor que me acompaña,
tálamo de nuestro fuego.
Entre estas cañas te esconde,
hasta que tenga lugar.
JUAN:          ¿Por dónde tengo de entrar?
TISBEA:        Ven, y te diré por dónde.
JUAN:             Gloria al alma, mi bien, dais.
TISBEA:        Esa voluntad te obligue,
y si no, Dios te castigue.
JUAN:          ¡Qué largo me lo fiáis!
Vanse y salen CORIDÓN, ANFRISO, BELISA y
MÚSICOS

CORIDÓN:          Ea, llamad a Tisbea,
y las zagalas llamad,
para que en la soledad
el huésped la corte vea.
ANFRISO:          ¡Tisbea, Lucindo, Antandra!
No vi cosa más crüel,
triste y mísero de aquél
que en su fuego es salamandra.
Antes que el baile empecemos,
a Tisbea prevengamos.
BELISA:        Vamos a llamarla.
CORIDÓN:                       Vamos.
BELISA:        A su cabaña lleguemos.
CORIDÓN:          ¿No ves que estará ocupada
con los huéspedes dichosos,
de quien hay mil envidiosos?
ANFRISO:       Siempre es Tisbea envidiada.
BELISA:           Cantad algo mientras viene,
porque queremos bailar.
ANFRISO:       ¿Cómo podrá descansar
cuidado que celos tiene?
Cantan

MÚSICOS:          ""A pescar sale la niña,
tendiendo redes,
y en lugar de pececillos,
las almas prende"".
Sale TISBEA

TISBEA:           ¡Fuego, fuego, que me quemo,
que mi cabaña se abrasa!
Repicad a fuego, amigos,
que ya dan mis ojos agua.
Mi pobre edificio queda
hecho otra Troya en las llamas,
que después que faltan Troyas,
quiere Amor quemar cabañas;
mas si Amor abrasa peñas,
con gran ira, fuerza extraña,
mal podrán de su rigor
reservarse humildes pajas.
¡Fuego, zagales, fuego, agua, agua!
Amor, clemencia, que se abrasa el alma.
¡Ay choza, vil instrumento
de mi deshonra, y mi infamia,
cueva de ladrones fiera,
que mis agravios ampara!
Rayos de ardientes estrellas
en tus cabelleras caigan,
porque abrasadas estén,
si del viento mal peinadas.
¡Ah falso huésped, que dejas
una mujer deshonrada!
¡Nube que del mar salió,
para anegar mis entrañas!
¡Fuego, zagales, fuego, agua, agua!
Amor, clemencia, que se abrasa el alma.
Yo soy la que hacía siempre
de los hombres burla tanta.
¡Que siempre las que hacen burla,
vienen a quedar burladas!
Engañóme el caballero
debajo de fe y palabra
de marido, y profanó
mi honestidad y mi cama.
Gozóme al fin, y yo propia
le di a su rigor las alas,
en dos yeguas que crïé,
con que me burló y se escapa.
Seguidle todos, seguidle,
mas no importa que se vaya,
que en la presencia del rey
tengo de pedir venganza.
¡Fuego, zagales, fuego, agua, agua!
Amor, clemencia, que se abrasa el alma.
Vase TISBEA

CORIDÓN:       Seguid al vil caballero.
ANFRISO:       Triste del que pena y calla,
mas vive el cielo que en él
me he de vengar de esta ingrata.
Vamos tras ella nosotros,
porque va desesperada,
y podrá ser que vaya ella
buscando mayor desgracia.
CORIDÓN:       Tal fin la soberbia tiene,
su locura y confïanza
paró en esto.
Dentro se oye gritando TISBEA ""¡Fuego,
fuego!""

ANFRISO:                 Al mar se arroja.
CORIDÓN:       Tisbea, detente y para.
TISBEA:        ¡Fuego, zagales, fuego, agua, agua!
Amor, clemencia, que se abrasa el alma."

Jeg er ked af hun sir' det sårn'
Men hun har nok ik' lige adressen til kirkegården
Siger jeg bruger Fie for views, okay okay okay chill my dudes
Det synes jeg er pudsigt, for din sidste video med mit navn er din bedst' i lang tid, Opsie
Siger jeg lever af det du har misforstået, men jeg kunne vende den om og sige i lige måde
For jeg er radiovært, du ved, voksen mand med karriere, lever ik' af og sidde og snak' om jeg har det svært
Dit omkvæd sagde at Johnni sku' få en hobby med YouTube er den hobby jeg går allermest op i, så det ikke nogen videnskab, dit fuldtidsarbejde det gør jeg bedre, bare for sjov, ved siden af
Jamen Johnni jeg har jo tøjet os'!
Ja den slags der blir' solgt nede i Toys'r'us
Ja undskyld, jeg er bare skeptisk fordi
Hvad hedder dit design? Epilepsi?
Det ligner mest en regnbue og en hippie der knepper
Hva' du inspireret af? Ny i trafikken kasketter?
Det ka' da umuligt være sejt nu
Det ligner lidt man har fået et cumshot af en regnbue
Du sir' jeg ka' få børnepunani
Helt ærligt Q, hva' fuck har du gang?
Jeg håber folk tar' alvorligt
Når Q snakker mistænksomt meget om kønsdelene, på en 13 årig
Sir' min kanal er for 10 årige, men du helt ude og skide
Der er ikk' andet end 10 årige på din First Grade side
Man ska' ikk' bide, hånden som der fodrer si'
Q, du ikk' halvdelen af den kvinde som jeg troede du var
Og det skidt, for mit vieversnit, er 18-24
Er du fatsvag eller dum til at lyve?
Jeg har den gnist som du aldrig slukker rapper
Du laver sange med Kristine Sloth du ved, barbiedukke rapper
Og det må føles så cool
Og ha' lavet en sang om at man ønsker sig et kys til jul
Du ruller ikk' tungt, du vægtløst og lille
Så hvem er du? Armins talentløse Kusine?
Du kedelig som en ventetone
Jeg vidst ikk' at Ole Wedel har købt en ekstra kone, som ligner Lebbelone
Så lav nogen flere drive in pranks
Med Anna Due, du ved coinoffer drive in skanks
Det selvmål som at sige man har en lille tis'mand
Når sit kunsternavn er et rigtig gammelt pigeband
Du til grin i showbizz
Dem du kalder for legender dem kalder jeg for homies
Og det ikk' pænt
Men jeg ved ikk' hva' legenderne siger om dig for når vi snakker har dit ligegyldige navn aldrig været nævnt
Tog en pause fra familien for det ligger i kortene
At far bliver seriøs når der er ting der ska' ordnes
Så hva' bliver det til IQ?
Hvis jeg lagde en finger på dig ville du sikkert råbe og skrige #MeToo
Er det klogt eller gennemtænkt?
Er navnet IQ en slags ironisk statement?
Ska' jeg bruge en mikrofon eller vaseline
For aldrig før har jeg battlet med en drag queen
Du siger I ikk' bruger kondom IQ
Men hvad med mig? For jeg knepper dig jo lige nu?
Du sku' aldrig ha' haft lov til at tale
Hørte jeg ordet integritet fra Splaybarnet over dem alle?
Du desperat for relevans
Typen der bliver hyret af Føtex til at stå og lave Albert dans
""Jeg vil så gerne være den sejeste dreng""
Men det op af bakke når man stadig lege med slime
Du har et lydstudie, jeg har et skrivebord
Du har personlig producer jeg har en legetøjsfigur
Men det som om din sang sucks
Og lyder som om din spejderleder boller dig med en autotune boks
Og du mistede også subs, på at lave et disstrack
Det nok ikk' kun mig der synes at det shit er wack
Og jeg har mødt Fie, hva' er der for nogen ting du siger
Vi cool og I begge to nogen flinke piger
10 steder du ikk' må spise chips
CONTENT! Pls gi' mig nogen tips
Konkurrencen er ikk' eksisterende
Selv Turdslev ville nok vøre mere intimiderende
IQ Mellepop vil så gerne være hep og hop
Sidder og tænker ""hvorfor skulle jeg også læg det op?""
Ved ikk' hvad du forventede, men ikk' det her
Men se nu bare mine rim som en form for CPR
Se det på den lyse side IQ
Din kanal den får jo noget trafik nu
Gad vide om det går ind under reningslinjer
Når man har et koldt lig og en retsmediciner?
Der er absolut ingen grund til at monetize
Når jeg sender Q ud på hans ånderejs'
For mit stemmbånd sender dig til helligånd nemt som om
Jeg slog dig i tennis... Med min venstre hånd
Det som om du ikke mener det
Som om at jeg er dit idol som du stener til
Men du må gå væææk, med din smålige falskhed
Gå væææk, før jeg bliver smittet med spedalskhed
Ka' se I har en alliance som var det Robinson
Men det helt cool jeg ikk' for at hold' i hånd
Du ka' se det her som et orgie
Alle der vil ha' en del af de ther de får det
Du blev stampet så meget, nu du klister på min sko
Ikk' få alt for ondt i nakken af at kig' på mit niveau
Jeg brugte et par dage, du brugte månedsvis
På en tekst der lyder som om at du har købt den på den blå avis
Så ja jeg får det sidste ord
I beefen mellem Johnni G og Sinterbells lillebror
Jeg too great, du too late
Hedder du Q fordi dit tøj det bliver solgt inde på Q8?
Jeg tager hul nu på det sjette minut
Du ka' slet ikk' benægte det slut
Du sådan en uber baddie
Hvem sender du efter mig Q? Din sugardaddy fra musically?
Det ovre så hurtigt jeg er kun lige startet
Det føles som jeg kun lige har opvarmet
Jeg ka' gør' det her i dagevis
Det kommer til mig ud af ingenting det magisk
Jeg ved godt det presset for dig, psykisk for dig
Men du ska' vide at det her er som at cykle for mig
Man ska' ikk' gå i krig hvis man er hjemmeværnet
Du lagde sjæl og hjertet i mesterværket
Men du ramte ikk' et sted i nærheden"

Mic check, isa , dalawa
Namiss ko lang mag-rap kaya pa-isa
Ambag ba sabi nila? puso at kaluluwa
Ramdam naman o dapat bang ipaliwanag ko pa?
Wag na siguro kung bitbit mo ay mahabong kalakal
Yung mga letrang patapon tang ina mo wag ka ng mag-ambag
Bitbit ko'y barang singsolido ng bakal
Simplehan lamang ang attack
Pero merong bigat ganyang maglapag , Dre!

Eargasmic mga rhymes ko parang shotgun lang ni Kurt
Di mo ko mabutata parang fade away ni Dirk
Minsan I feel like Rihanna coz all i do is work
Dapat merong mga bara hindi basta lang skiiirrrrt
Kung Hip-hop ay isang puta sakin sya mag ssquirt
Kailangan na ng Gin at Marijuana asan na si Jerk
Mga plano parang balat ng negro oo pare dark
Yung iba lighter na walang bato kaya walang spark

Sobrang hirap ang mabuhay dito sa Manila
Puro pera kasikatan dami ngang nasilaw
Pekeng pag ibig ang dali mo lang makita
Kainin mo ang letra, lasahan mo ang tinta
Pulang kabayo pag sumipa
Ibang ibayo, iwas sa hilig mag panggap di mo ko maloloko
Di mo nanaisin pa kung alam mo lang yung dulo
Ramdam ko ang habagat, habang ako'y kalmado (rawgh!)
Batang maangas na taga batangas
Utak tsaka balisong ay magkasing talas
Walang pahinga lambanog sa sistema
Pussy pera respeto ang paboritong tema
Lino Broca, Peque Gallaga ako ay obra
Mga bara mahigpit pa sa skinny na lonta
Pen game sick me sipon ang aking tinta
Parang cocaina kung tumama aking linya

Patibayan ng loob palakasan ng kutob
Malalabasan ang magtatangkang manloob
Kung lagpas tao ang lalim tawag dun lunod
Pero hanggang ari ko palang ""Chic mo luhod""
Ang dami ng langgam at mahilig sa matamis
Ang alat ng dala kaya bigyan ko ng pait
Gustong magpabango eeehhh lagi naman nilalangaw
Mga panis di niyo na kailangan magtakip men!

Kontrolado ang laro parang nasa space ship
Galawan mo Space Jam baduy ang epic
Tawagin mong Chappie may sarili tong galaw
Trap mapa Boom Bap kayang bumitaw
I dont give a fuck tanging sarili ko kakosa ko
Ang lakas ng amat iihian ko kalaban
Ayokong magbuhat kung maraming pabigat
Umay sa sistemang binabalot ng panggap
Ako ay dedikado, di kabadong
Pasukin mga delikadong
Lagusan laging kargadong
Buksan ang nakakandadong
Diwa ninyo gamit ang musika
Wag na wag manlalaban kung mahuhuli ka
Ng aming tunog na pampagising ng tulog
Nakipagsapakan kay tadhana kaya kame hubog
Kung foodtrip ang kasipagan malamang kame busog
Trabaho lang walang personalan dadaan kame usooogggg!

Oo ilan ay uhaw pero kami ay gutom
Kung gusto mong malaman sige pindutin ang button (enk!)
Simula na ng Ballgame, Shot muna ng Codeine
Utak na malawak busog puno at full tank
Hipokrito sa game di daw gumaya man, your copycat
Copy that, utak talangka pwedeng tawagin to na Krabby Patt
You know I'm always throwing punchlines like Manny Pac
On my business wala nang tawad I wany my money back

Andito ko bilang kasapi ng pambihirang
Pangkat naming hinihilang pataas mga may bilang
Ang mga isinilang para sa tinta at papel
Ito ay kasaysayan daw sana mag-dilang anghel
At di lang ang hell ang kinakatakutan, napapa-putang
Ang mga makatang biglaan na lang nagsulputan
Parang siningil ko't napamura dahil sa utang
Di ko kailangan magsindi ng damo para lumutang (ugh)
Ilang bara para sa paharahara, barabara ?
Naku bata kumapit walang papara
Mikropono manibela lapis ang pang maniobra
Sobra sobra ang obra pwedeng pang pwerta at gera
Letra ko ang siyang sinag nakapag sumulat uusad
Bubungad sakin liwanag sa biyahe di matitinag
Lubak lubak gugulungan, kahit tinik lalakaran
Pakaragkarag man minsan tuloy kahit mabutasan
Laway lang ang panapal, sasagasaan sagabal
Kinakalawang iwasan ang pabigat iiwanan
Gagamitan ng primera,segunda pati tersera
Sa gitna ng karera pag nag init gamit ng kwarta"

No shadows, no reflections here
Lying cheek to cheek, in your cold embrace
So soft and so tragic, as a slaughterhouse
You press the knife against your heart
And say that, ""I love you so much, you must kill me now""
""I love you so much, you must kill me, now""

If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time
We'll have each other until the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face
Because I think our time has come

Digging your smile apart with my spade tongue
And the hole is where the heart is
We built this tomb together, I won't fill it alone
Beyond the pale
Everything's black, no turning back
If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time
We'll have each other until the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face
Because I think our time has come

Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart
This is where it starts...
Blood-stained sheets
In the shape of your heart
This is where it starts, this is where it will end
Here comes the moon again

6:19 and I know I'm ready
Drive me off the mountain
You'll burn and I'll eat your ashes
The impossible wheels seducing our corpse

If I was your vampire, certain as the moon
Instead of killing time
We'll have each other until the sun
If I was your vampire, death waits for no one
Hold my hands across your face
Because I think our time has come
Beyond the pale
Everything's black, no turning back
Beyond the pale
Everything's black, no turning back

This is where it starts, this is where it will end
Here comes the moon again
Here comes the moon again
This is where it starts, this is where it will end
Here comes the moon again
Here comes the moon again
Here comes the moon again
Here comes the moon again"

Euclides da Cunha
Nota Preliminar
Escrito nos raros intervalos de folga de uma carreira fatigante, este livro, que a princípio se resumia à história da
Campanha de Canudos, perdeu toda a atualidade, remorada a sua publicação em virtude de causas que temos por
escusado apontar.
Demos -lhe, por isto, outra feição, tomando apenas variante de assunto geral o tema, a princípio dominante, que
o sugeriu.
Intentamos esboçar, palidamente embora, ante o olhar de futuros historiadores, os traços atuais mais expressivos
das sub-raças sertanejas do Brasil. E fazêmo-lo porque a sua instabilidade de complexos de fatores múltiplos e
diversamente combinados, aliada às vicissitudes históricas e deplorável situação mental em que jazem, as tomam
talvez efêmeras, destinadas a próximo desaparecimento ante as exigências crescentes da civilização e a
concorrência material intensiva das correntes migratórias que começam a invadir profundamente a nossa terra.
O jagunço destemeroso, o tabaréu ingênuo e o caipira simplório serão em breve tipos relegados às tradições
evanescentes, ou extintas.
Primeiros efeitos de variados cruzamentos, destinavam-se talvez à formação dos princípios imediatos de uma
grande raça. Faltou-lhes, porém, uma situação de parada, o equilíbrio, que Ihes não permite mais a velocidade
adquirida pela marcha dos povos neste século. Retardatários hoje, amanhã se extinguirão de todo.
A civilização avançará nos sertões impelida por essa implacável ""força motriz da História"" que Gumplowicz,
maior do que Hobbes, lobrigou, num lance genial, no esmagamento inevitável das raças fracas pelas raças fortes.
A campanha de Canudos tem por isto a significação inegável de um primeiro assalto, em luta talvez longa. Nem
enfraquece o asserto o termo-la realizado nós filhos do mesmo solo, porque, etnologicamente indefinidos, sem
tradições nacionais uniformes, vivendo parasitariamente à beira do Atlântico, dos princípios civilizadores
elaborados na Europa, e armados pela indústria alemã — tivemos na ação um papel singular de mercenários
inconscientes. Além disto, mal unidos àqueles extraordinários patrícios pelo solo em parte desconhecido, deles
de todo nos separa uma coordenada histórica — o tempo.
Aquela campanha lembra um refluxo para o passado.
E foi, na significação integral da palavra, um crime.
Denunciemo-lo.
E tanto quanto o permitir a firmeza do nosso espírito façamos jus ao admirável conceito de Taine sobre o
narrador sincero que encara a História como ela merece:
“il s’ irrite contre les demi vérités que sont des demi faussetés, contre les auteurs qui n’altèrent ni une date, ni
une généalogie, mais dénaturent les sentiments et les moeurs, qui gardent le dessin des événements et en
changent la couleur, qui copient les faits et défigurent l'âme; il veut sentir en barbare, parmi les barbares, et,
parmi les anciens, en ancien. ""
Euclides da Cunha.
São Paulo, 1901
Capítulo I
Preliminares
O Planalto Central do Brasil desce, nos litorais do Sul, em escarpas inteiriças, altas e abruptas. Assoberba os
mares; e desata-se em chapadões nivelados pelos visos das cordilheiras marítimas, distendidas do Rio Grande a
Minas. Mas ao derivar para as terras setentrionais diminui gradualmente de altitude, ao mesmo tempo que
descamba para a costa oriental em andares, ou repetidos socalcos, que o despem da primitiva grandeza
afastando-o consideravelmente para o interior.
De sorte que quem o contorna, seguindo para o norte, observa notáveis mudanças de relevos: a principio o
traço contínuo e dominante das montanhas, precintando-o, com destaque saliente, sobre a linha projetante das
praias; depois, no segmento de orla marítima entre o Rio de Janeiro e o Espírito Santo, um aparelho litoral
revolto, feito da envergadura desarticulada das serras, riçado de cumeadas e corroído de angras, e
escancelando-se em baias, repartindo-se em ilhas, e desagregando-se em recifes desnudos, à maneira de
escombros do conflito secular que ali se trava entre os mares e a terra; em seguida, transposto o 15° paralelo, a
atenuação de todos os acidentes — serranias que se arredondam e suavizam as linhas dos taludes, fracionadas em
morros de encostas indistintas no horizonte que se amplia; até que em plena faixa costeira da Bahia, o olhar, livre
dos anteparos de serras que até lá o repulsam e abreviam, se dilata em cheio para o ocidente, mergulhando no
âmago da terra amplíssima lentamente emergindo num ondear longínquo de chapadas...
Este facies geográfico resume a morfogenia do grande maciço continental.
Demonstra-o análise mais íntima feita por um corte meridiano qualquer, acompanhando à bacia do S.
Francisco.
Vê-se, do fato, que três formações geognósticas díspares, de idades mal determinadas, aí se substituem, ou
se entrelaçam, em estratificações discordantes, formando o predomínio exclusivo de umas, ou a combinação de
todas, os traços variáveis da fisionomia da terra. Surgem primeiro as possantes massas gnaissegraníticas, que a
partir do extremo sul se encurvam em desmedido anfiteatro, alteando as paisagens admiráveis que tanto
encantam e iludem as vistas inexpertas dos forasteiros. A princípio abeiradas do mar progridem em sucessivas
cadeias, sem rebentos laterais, até as raias do litoral paulista, feito dilatado muro de arrimo sustentando as
formações sedimentárias do interior. A terra sobranceia o oceano, dominante, do fastígio das escarpas; e quem a
alcança como quem vinga a rampa de um majestoso palco, justifica todos os exageros descritivos — do
gongorismo de Rocha Pita às extravagâncias geniais de Buckle — que fazem deste país região privilegiada, onde
a natureza armou a sua mais portentosa oficina.
É que, de feito, sob o tríplice aspecto astronômico, topográfico e geológico a nenhuma se afigura tão
afeiçoada à Vida.
Transmontadas as serras, sob a linha fulgurante do trópico, vêem-se, estirados para o ocidente e norte, extensos
chapadões cuja urdidura de camadas horizontais de grés argiloso, intercaladas de emersões calcárias, ou diques
de rochas eruptivas básicas, do mesmo passo lhes explica a exuberância sem par e as áreas complanadas e vastas.
A terra atrai irresistivelmente o homem, arrebatando-o na própria correnteza dos rios que, do Iguaçu ao Tietê,
traçando originalíssima rede hidrográfica, correm da costa para os sertões, como se nascessem nos mares e
canalizassem as suas energias eternas para os recessos das matas opulentas. Rasgam facilmente aqueles estratos
em traçados uniformes, sem talvegues deprimidos, e dão ao conjunto dos terrenos até além do Paraná a feição de
largos plainos ondulados, desmedidos.
Entretanto, para leste a natureza é diversa.
Estereografa-se, duramente, nas placas rígidas dos afloramentos gnáissicos; e o talude dos planaltos
dobra-se do socalco da Mantiqueira, onde se encaixa o Paraíba, ou desfaz-se em rebentos que, após apontarem as
alturas de píncaros centralizados pelo Itatiaia, levam até o âmago de Minas as paisagens alpestres do litoral. Mas
ao penetrar-se este Estado nota-se, malgrado o tumultuar das serranias, lenta descensão geral para o norte. Como
nos altos chapadões de São Paulo e do Paraná, todas as caudais revelam este pendor insensível com derivarem
em leitos contorcidos e vencendo, contrafeitas, o antagonismo permanente das montanhas: o rio Grande rompe,
rasgando-a com a força viva da corrente, a serra da Canastra, e, norteados pela meridiana, abrem-se adiante os
fundos vales de erosão do rio das Velhas e do S. Francisco. Ao mesmo tempo, transpostas as sublevações que
vão de Barbacena a Ouro Preto, as formações primitivas desaparecem, mesmo nas maiores eminências, e jazem
sotopostas a complexas séries de xistos metamórficos, infiltrados de veeiros fartos, nas paragens lendárias do
ouro.
A mudança estrutural origina quadros naturais mais imponentes que os da borda marítima. A região
continua alpestre. O caráter das rochas, exposto nas abas dos cerros de quartzito, ou nas grimpas em que se
empilham as placas do itacolomito avassalando as alturas, aviva todos os acidentes, desde os maciços que vão de
Ouro Branco a Sabará, à zona diamantina expandindo-se para nordeste nas chapadas que se desenrolam
nivelando-se às cimas da serra do Espinhaço; e esta, apesar da sugestiva denominação de Eschwege, mal
sobressai, entre aquelas lombadas definidoras de uma situação dominante. Dali descem, acachoantes, para o
levante, tombando em catadupas ou saltando ""travessões"" sucessivos, todos os rios que do Jequitinhonha ao
Doce procuram os terraços inferiores do planalto arrimados à serra dos Aimorés; e volvem águas remansadas
para o poente os que se destinam à bacia de captação do S. Francisco, em cujo vale, depois de percorridas ao sul
as interessantes formações calcárias do rio das Velhas, salpintadas de lagos, solapadas de sumidouros e ribeirões
subterrâneos, onde se abrem as cavernas do homem pré-histórico de Lund, se acentuam outras transições na
contextura superficial do solo.
De fato, as camadas anteriores, que vimos superpostas às rochas graníticas, decaem, por sua vez
sotopondo-se a outras, mais modernas de espessos estratos de grés.
Novo horizonte geológico reponta com um traço original e interessante. Mal estudado embora, caracteriza-o
notável significação orográfica, porque as cordilheiras dominantes do sul ali se extinguem, soterradas, numa
inumação estupenda, pelos possantes estratos mais recentes, que as circundam. A terra, porém, permanece
elevada, alongando-se em planuras amplas, ou avultando em falsas montanhas de denudação, descendo em
aclives fortes, mas tendo os dorsos alargados em plainos inscritos num horizonte de nível, apenas apontoado a
leste pelos vértices dos albardões distantes, que perlongam a costa.
Verifica-se. assim, a tendência para um aplainamento geral.
Porque, neste coincidir das terras altas do interior e a depressão das formações arqueanas, a região
montanhosa de minas se vai prendendo, sem ressaltos, à extensa zona dos tabuleiros do norte.
A serra do Grão Mogol raiando as lindes da Bahia, é o primeiro espécimen dessas esplêndidas chapadas
imitando cordilheiras, que tanto perturbam aos geógrafos descuidados; e as demais que a convizinham, da do
Cabral mais próxima, à da Mata da Corda alongando-se para Goiás, modelam-se de maneira idêntica. Os sulcos
de erosão que as retalham são cortes geológicos expressivos. Ostentam em plano vertical, sucedendo-se a partir
da base, as mesmas rochas que vimos substituírem em alongado roteiro pela superfície: embaixo os rebentos
graníticos decaídos pelo fundo dos vales, em cômoros esparsos; à meia encosta, inclinadas, as placas xistosas
mais recentes; no alto, sobrepujando-as, ou circuitando-lhes os flancos em vales monoclínicos, os lençóis de
grés, predominantes e oferecendo aos agentes meteóricos plasticidade admirável aos mais caprichosos modelos.
Sem linhas de cumeadas, as maiores serranias nada mais são que planuras altas, extensas rechãs terminando de
chofre em encostas abruptas, na molduragem golpeante do regímen torrencial sobre o terreno permeável e
móvel. Caindo por ali há séculos as fortes enxurradas, derivando a princípio em linhas divagantes de drenagem,
foram pouco a pouco reprofundando-as, talhando-as em quebradas que se fizeram cañons, e se fizeram vales em
declive, até orlarem de escarpamentos e despenhadeiros aqueles plainos soerguidos. E consoante a resistência
dos materiais trabalhados variaram nos aspectos: aqui apontam, rijamente, sobre as áreas de nível, os últimos
fragmentos das rochas enterradas, desvendando-se em fraguedos que mal relembram, na altura, o antiqüíssimo
""Himalaia brasileiro"", desbarrancado, em desintegração contínua, por todo o curso das idades; adiante, mais
caprichosos, se escalonam em alinhamentos incorretos de menires colossais, ou em círculos enormes, recordando
na disposição dos grandes blocos superpostos, em rimas, muramentos desmantelados de ciclópicos coliseus em
ruínas ou então, pelos visos das escarpas, oblíquos e sobreanceando as planuras que, interopostos, ladeiam,
lembram aduelas desconformes, restos da monstruosa abóbada da antiga cordilheira, desabada...
Mas desaparecem de todo em vários pontos.
Estiram-se então planuras vastas. Galgando-as pelos taludes, que as soerguem dando-lhes a aparência exata
de tabuleiros suspensos, topam-se, a centenas de metros, extensas áreas ampliando-se, boleadas, pelos
quadrantes, numa prolongação indefinida, de mares. É a paragem formosíssima dos campos gerais, expandida
em chapadões ondulantes —grandes tablados onde campeia a sociedade rude dos vaqueiros...
Atravessêmo-la.
Adiante, a partir de Monte Alto, estas conformações naturais se bipartem: no rumo firme do norte a série do
grés figura-se progredir até ao plateau arenoso do Açuruá, associando-se ao calcário que aviva as paisagens na
orla do grande rio, prendendo-as às linhas dos cerros talhados em diáclase, tão bem expressos no perfil fantástico
do Bom Jesus da Lapa; enquanto para nordeste, graças a degradações intensas (porque a serra Geral segue por ali
como anteparo aos alísios, condensando-os em diluvianos aguaceiros), se desvendam, ressurgindo, as formações
antigas.
Desenterram-se as montanhas.
Reponta a região diamantina, na Bahia, revivendo inteiramente a de Minas, como um desdobramento ou
antes um prolongamento, porque é a mesma formação mineira rasgando, afinal, os lençóis de grés, e alteando-se
com os mesmos contornos alpestres e perturbados, nos alcantis que irradiam da Tromba ou avultam para o norte
nos xistos huronianos das cadeias paralelas de Sincorá.
Deste ponto em diante, porém, o eixo da serra Geral se fragmenta, indefinido. Desfaz-se. A cordilheira
eriça-se de contrafortes e talhados de onde saltam, acachoando, em despenhos, para o levante, as nascentes do
Paraguaçu, e um dédalo de serranias tortuosas, pouco elevadas mas inúmeras, cruza-se embaralhadamente sobre
o largo dos gerais, cobrindo-os. Transmuda-se o caráter topográfico, retratando o desapoderado embater dos
elementos, que ali reagem há milênios entre montanhas derruídas, e a queda, até então gradativa, dos planaltos
começa a derivar em desnivelamentos consideráveis. Revela-os o S. Francisco, no vivo infletir com que torce
para o levante, indicando do mesmo passo a transformação geral da região.
Esta é mais deprimida e mais revolta.
Cai para os terraços inferiores, entre um tumultuar de morros, incoerentemente esparsos. Último rebento da
serra principal, a da Itiúba reúne-lhe alguns galhos indecisos, fundindo as expansões setentrionais das da Furna,
Cocais e Sincorá. Alteia-se um momento, mas descai logo para todos os rumos: para o norte, originando a
corredeira de quatrocentos quilômetros à jusante do Sobradinho; para o sul, em segmentos dispersos que vão até
além do Monte Santo; e para leste, passando sob as chapadas de Jeremoabo, até se desvendar no salto prodigioso
de Paulo Afonso.
E o observador que seguindo este itinerário deixa as paragens em que se revezam, em contraste belíssimo, a
amplitude dos gerais e o fastígio das montanhas, ao atingir aquele ponto estaca surpreendido...
A entrada sertão
Está sobre um socalco do maciço continental, ao norte.
Demarca-o de uma banda, abrangendo dois quadrantes, em semicírculo, o rio de S. Francisco: e de outra,
encurvando também para sudeste, numa normal a direção primitiva, o curso flexuoso do Itapicuru-açu. Segundo
a mediana, correndo quase paralelo entre aqueles, com o mesmo descambar expressivo para a costa, vê-se o
traço de um outro rio, o Vaza-Barris, o Irapiranga dos tapuias, cujo trecho de Jeremoabo para as cabeceiras é
uma fantasia de cartógrafo. De fato, no estupendo degrau, por onde descem para o mar ou para jusante de Paulo
Afonso as rampas esbarrancadas do planalto, não há situações de equilíbrio para uma rede hidrográfica normal.
Ali reina a drenagem caótica das torrentes, a naquele da Bahia facies excepcional e selvagem.
Terra ignota
Abordando-o, compreende-se que até hoje escasseiem sobre tão grande trato de território, que quase
abarcaria a Holanda (9º 11' — 10º 20' de lat. e 4° — 3° de long. O.R.J. ), notícias exatas ou pormenorizadas. As
nossas melhores cartas, enfeixando informes escassos, lá têm um claro expressivo, um hiato, Terra ignota, em
que se aventura o rabisco de um rio problemático ou idealização de uma corda de serras.
E. que transpondo o Itapicuru, pelo lado do sul, as mais avançadas turmas de povoadores estacaram em
vilarejos minúsculos — Maçacará, Cumbe ou Bom Conselho — entre os quais o decaído Monte Santo tem visos
de cidade: transmontada a Itiúba, a sudoeste, disseminaram-se pelos povoados que a abeiram acompanhando
insignificantes cursos de água, ou pelas raras fazendas de gado, estremados todos por uma tapera obscura —
Uauá, ao norte e a leste pararam às margens do S. Francisco, entre Capim Grosso e Santo Antônio da Glória.
Apenas naquele último rumo se avantajou uma vila secular, Jeremoabo, batizando o máximo esforço de
penetração em tais lugares, evitados sempre pelas vagas humanas, que vinham do litoral baiano procurando o
interior.
Uma ou outra o cortou, rápida, fugindo, sem deixar traços.
Nenhuma lá se fixou. Não se podia fixar. O estranho território, a menos de quarenta léguas da antiga
metrópole, predestinava-se a atravessar absolutamente esquecido os quatrocentos anos da nossa história. Porque
enquanto as bandeiras do sul lhe paravam à beira e envesgando, depois, pelos flancos da Itiúba, se lançavam para
Pernambuco e Piauí até o Maranhão as do levante, repelidas pela barreira intransponível de Paulo Afonso, iam
procurar, no Paraguaçu e rios que lhe demoram ao sul, linhas de acesso mais praticáveis, Deixavam-no de
permeio, inabordável, ignoto.
É que mesmo trilhando o último daqueles rumos, adstritas a itinerário menos longo, as salteava
impressionadoramente o aspecto estranho da terra repontando em transições imprevistas.
Deixando a orla marítima e seguindo em cheio para o ocidente, tinham, transcorridas poucas léguas,
amolentada ou desinfluída a atração das ""entradas"" aventurosas, e extinta a miragem do litoral opulento. Logo a
partir de Camassari as formações antigas cobrem-se de escassas manchas terciárias, alternando com exíguas
bacias cretáceas, revestidas do terreno arenoso de Alagoinhas que mal esgarçam, a leste, as emersões calcárias de
Inhambupe. A vegetação em roda transmuda-se, copiando estas alternativas com a precisão de um decalque.
Rarefazem-se as matas, ou empobrecem. Extinguem-se, por fim, depois de lançarem rebentos esparsos pelo topo
das serranias; e estas mesmo, aqui e ali, cada vez mais raras, ilham-se ou avançam em promontório nas planuras
desnudas dos campos, onde uma flora característica — arbustos flexuosos entrechassados de bromélias rubras —
prepondera exclusiva em largas áreas, mal dominada pela vegetação vigorosa irradiante da Pojuca sobre o
massapé feraz das camadas cretáceas decompostas.
Deste lugar em diante, reaparecem os terrenos terciários esterilizadores, sobre os mais antigos que,
entretanto, depois, dominam em toda a zona centralizada em Serrinha. Os morros do Lopes e do Lajedo
aprumam-se, à maneira de disformes pirâmides de blocos arredondados e lisos; e os que se sucedem, beirando de
um e outro lado as abas das serras da Saúde e da Itiúba, até Vila Nova da Rainha e Juazeiro, copiam-lhes os
mesmos contornos das encostas estaladas, exumando a ossatura partida das montanhas.
O observador tem a impressão de seguir torneando a truncadura malgradada da borda de um planalto.
Calca, de fato, estrada três vezes secular, histórica vereda por onde avançavam os rudes sertanistas nas suas
excursões para o interior.
Não a alteraram nunca.
Não a variou, mais tarde, a civilização, justapondo aos rastos do bandeirante os trilhos de uma via férrea.
Porque o caminho em cuja longura de cem léguas, da Bahia ao Juazeiro, se entroncam numerosíssimos
desvios para o poente e para o sul, jamais comportou, a partir de seu trecho médio, variante apreciável para leste
e para o norte.
Calcando-o, em demanda do Piauí, Pernambuco, Maranhão e Pará, os povoadores, consoante vários
destinos, dividiam-se em Serrinha. E progredindo para Juazeiro, ou volvendo à direita, pela estrada real do Bom
Conselho que, desde o século 17, os levava a Santo Antônio da Glória e Pernambuco — uns e outros
contorneavam sempre, evitando-a sempre, a paragem sinistra e desolada, subtraindo-se a uma travessia
torturante.
De sorte que aquelas duas linhas de penetração, que vão interferir o S. Francisco em pontos afastados —
Juazeiro e Santo Antônio da Glória —, formavam, desde aqueles tempos, as lindes de um deserto.
Em caminho para Monte Santo
No entanto quem se abalança a atravessá-lo, partindo de Queimadas para nordeste, não se surpreende a
princípio. Recurvo em meandros, o Itapicuru alenta vegetação vivaz; e as barrancas pedregosas do Jacurici
debruam-se de pequenas matas. O terreno, areento e chão, permite travessia desafogada e rápida. Aos lados do
caminho ondulam tabuleiros rasos. A pedra, aflorando em lajedos horizontais, mal movimenta o solo,
esgarçando a tênue capa das areias que o revestem.
Vêem-se, porém, depois, lugares que se vão tornando crescentemente áridos.
Varada a estreita faixa de cerrados, que perlongam aquele último rio, está-se em pleno agreste, no dizer
expressivo dos matutos: arbúsculos quase sem pega sobre a terra escassa, enredados de esgalhos de onde
irrompem, solitários, cereus rígidos e salientes, dando ao conjunto a aparência de uma margem de desertos. E o
facies daquele sertão inóspito vai-se esboçando, lenta e impressionadoramente...
Galga-se uma ondulação qualquer — e ele se desvenda ou se deixa adivinhar, ao longe, no quadro tristonho
de um horizonte monótono em que se esbate, uniforme, sem um traço diversamente colorido, o pardo
requeimado das caatingas.
Intercorrem ainda paragens menos estéreis, e nos trechos em que se operou a decomposição in situ do
granito, originando algumas manchas argilosas, as copas virentes dos ouricurizeiros circuitam — parêntesis
breves abertos na aridez geral — as bordas das ipueiras. Estas lagoas mortas, segundo a bela etimologia
indígena, demarcam obrigatória escala ao caminhante. Associando-se às cacimbas e ""caldeirões"", em que se abre
a pedra, são-lhe recurso único na viagem penosíssima. Verdadeiros oásis, têm contudo, não raro, um aspecto
lúgubre: localizadas em depressões, entre colinas nuas, envoltas pelos mandacarus despidos e tristes, como
espectros de árvores; ou num colo de chapada, recortando-se com destaque no chão poento e pardo, graças à
placa verde-negra das algas unicelulares que as revestem.
Algumas denotam um esforço dos filhos do sertão. Encontram-se, orlando-as, erguidos como represas entre
as encostas, toscos muramentos de pedra seca. Lembram monumentos de uma sociedade obscura. Patrimônio
comum dos que por ali se agitam nas aperturas do clima feroz, vêm em geral, de remoto passado.
Delinearam-nos os que se afoitaram primeiro com as vicissitudes de uma entrada naquelas bandas. E persistem
indestrutíveis, porque o sertanejo, por mais escoteiro que siga, jamais deixa de levar uma pedra que calce as suas
junturas vacilantes.
Mas transpostos estes pontos — imperfeita cópia das barragens romanas remanescentes na Tunísia —
entra-se outra vez nos areais exsicados. E avançando célere, sobretudo nos trechos em que se sucedem pequenas
ondulações, todas da mesma forma e do mesmo modo dispostas, o viajante mais rápido tem a sensação da
imobilidade. Patenteiam-se-lhe uniformes, os mesmos quadros, num horizonte invariável que se afasta à medida
que ele avança. Raras vezes, como no povoado minúsculo de Cansanção, larga emersão de terreno fértil se
recama de vegetação virente.
Despontam vivendas pobres; algumas desertas pela retirada dos vaqueiros que a seca espavoriu; em ruínas,
outras, agravando todas no aspecto paupérrimo o traço melancólico das paisagens...
Nas cercanias de Quirinquinquá, porem, começa a movimentar-se o solo. O pequeno sítio ali ereto alevantase
já sobre alta expansão granítica, e atentando-se para o norte divisa-se região diversa — riçada de vales e
serranias, perdendo-se ao longe em grimpas fugitivas. A serra de Monte Santo, com um perfil de todo oposto aos
redondos contornos que lhe desenhou o ilustre Martins, empina-se, a pique, na frente, em possante dique de
quartzito branco, de azulados tons, em relevo sobre a massa gnáissica que Constitui toda a base do solo.
Dominante sobre seu enorme paredão, vincado pelas linhas dos estratos, expostas pela erosão eólia, afigura-se
cortina de muralha monumental. Termina em crista altíssima, estremando-lhe o desenvolvimento no rumo de 13°
NE, a cavaleiro da vila que se lhe erige no sopé. Centraliza um horizonte vasto. Observa-se, então, que atenuados
para o sul e leste, os acidentes predominantes da terra progridem avassalando os quadrantes do norte.
O sítio do Caldeirão, três léguas adiante, ergue-se à margem dessa sublevação metamórfica; e alcançando-o,
e transpondo entra-se. afinal, em cheio, no sertão adusto...
Primeiras impressões
É uma paragem impressionadora
As condições estruturais da terra lá se vincularam à violência máxima dos agentes exteriores para o
desenho de relevos estupendos. O regímen torrencial dos climas excessivos, sobrevindo, de súbito, depois das
insolações demoradas, e embatendo naqueles pendores, expôs há muito, arrebatando-lhes para longe todos os
elementos degradados, as séries mais antigas daqueles últimos rebentos das montanhas: todas as variedades
cristalinas, e os quartzitos ásperos, e as filades e calcários, revezando-se ou entrelaçando-se, repontando
duramente a cada passo, mal cobertos por uma flora tolhiça — dispondo-se em cenários em que ressalta
predominante, o aspecto atormentado das paisagens.
Porque o que estas denunciam — no enterroado do chão, no desmantelo dos cerros quase desnudos, no
contorcido dos leitos secos dos ribeirões efêmeros, no constrito das gargantas e no quase convulsivo de uma
flora decídua embaralhada em esgalhos — é de algum modo o martírio da terra, brutalmente golpeada pelos
elementos variáveis, distribuídos por todas as modalidades climáticas. De um lado a extrema secura dos ares, no
estio, facilitando pela irradiação noturna a perda instantânea do calor absorvido pelas rochas expostas às
soalheiras, impõe-lhes a alternativa de alturas e quedas termométricas repentinas: e daí um jogar de dilatações e
contrações que as disjunge, abrindo-as segundo os planos de menor resistência. De outro, as chuvas que fecham,
de improviso, os ciclos adurentes das secas, precipitam estas reações demoradas.
As forças que trabalham a terra atacam-na na contextura íntima e na superfície sem intervalos na ação
demolidora, substituindo-se, com intercadência invariável, nas duas estações únicas da região.
Dissociam-na nos verões queimosos; degradam-na nos invernos torrenciais. Vão do desequilíbrio
molecular, agindo surdamente, à dinâmica portentosa das tormentas. Ligam-se e completam-se. E consoante o
preponderar de uma e outra, ou o entrelaçamento de ambas, modificam-se os aspectos naturais. As mesmas
assomadas gnáissicas caprichosamente cindidas em planos quase geométricos, à maneira de silhares, que surgem
em numerosos pontos, dando, às vezes, a ilusão de encontrar-se, de repente, naqueles ermos vazios, majestosas
ruinarias de castelos — adiante se cercam de fraguedos, em desordem, mal seguros sobre as bases estreitas, em
ângulos de queda, incombentes e instáveis, feito loghans oscilantes, ou grandes desmoronamentos de dolmens; e
mais longe desaparecem sob acervos de blocos, com a imagem perfeita desses ""mares de pedra"" tão
característicos dos lugares onde imperam os regímens excessivos. Pelas abas dos cerros, que tumultuam em roda
— restos de velhíssimas chapadas corroídas —, se derramam, ora em alinhamentos relembrando velhos
caminhos de geleiras, ora esparsos a esmo, espessos lastros de seixos e lajens fraturadas, delatando idênticas
violências. As arestas dos fragmentos, onde persistem ainda cimentados ao quartzo os cristais de feldspato, são
novos atestados desses eleitos físicos e mecânicos que, despedaçando as rochas, sem que se decomponham os
seus elementos formadores, se avantajaram ao vagar dos agentes químicos em função dos fatos meteorológicos
normais.
Deste modo se tem a cada passo, em todos os pontos, um lineamento incisivo de rudeza extrema.
Atenuando-o em parte, deparam-se várzeas deprimidas, sedes de antigos lagos, extintos agora em ipueiras
apauladas, que demarcam os pousos dos vaqueiros. Recortam-nas, no entanto, abertos em caixão, os leitos as
mais das vezes secos de ribeirões que só se enchem nas breves estações das chuvas. Obstruídos, na maioria, de
espessos lastros de blocos entre os quais, fora das enchentes súbitas, defluem tênues fios de água, são uma
reprodução completa dos oueds que marginam o Saara. Despontam-lhes em geral, normais às barrancas, estratos
de um talcoxisto azul-escuro em placas brunidas reverberando a luz em fulgurar metálico — e sobre elas,
cobrindo extensas áreas, camadas menos resistentes de argila vermelha, cindidas de veios de quartzo,
interceptando-lhes, discordantes, os planos estratigráficos. Estas últimas formações, silurianas talvez, cobrem de
todo as demais à medida que se caminha para NE e apropriam-se a contornos mais corretos. Esclarecem a gênese
dos tabuleiros rasos, que se desatam, cobertos de uma vegetação resistente, de mangabeiras, até Jeremoabo.
Para o norte, porém, inclinam-se mais fortemente as camadas. Sucedem-se cômoros despidos, de pendores
resvalantes, descaindo em quebradas onde enxurram torrentes periódicas, solapando-os; e pelos seus topos
divisam-se, alinhadas em fileiras, destacadas em lâminas, as mesmas infiltrações quartzosas, expostas pela
decomposição dos xistos em que se embebem.
À luz crua dos dias sertanejos aqueles cerros, aspérrimos rebrilham, estonteadoramente — ofuscante, num
irradiar ardentíssimo.
As erosões constantes quebram, porém, a continuidade destes estratos que ademais, noutros pontos,
desaparecem sob as formações calcárias. Mas o conjunto pouco se transmuda. A feição ruiniforme destas,
casa-se bem a dos outros acidentes. E nos trechos em que elas se estiram, planas, pelo solo, desabrigadas de todo
ante a acidez corrosiva dos aguaceiros tempestuosos, crivam-se, escarificadas, de cavidades circulares e
acanaladuras fundas, diminutas mas inúmeras, tangenciando-se em quinas de rebordos cortantes, em pontas e
duríssimos estrepes que impossibilitam as marchas.
Deste modo, por qualquer vereda, sucedem-se acidentes pouco elevados mas abruptos, pelos quais tornejam
os caminhos, quando não se justapõem por muitas légua aos leitos vazios dos ribeirões esgotados. E por mais
inexperto que seja o observador — ao deixar as perspectivas majestosas, que se desdobram ao Sul, trocando-as
pelos cenários emocionantes daquela natureza torturada, tem a impressão persistente de calcar o fundo
recém-sublevado de um mar extinto, tendo ainda estereotipada naquelas camadas rígidas a agitação das ondas e
das voragens...
Um sonho de geólogo
É uma sugestão empolgante.
Vai-se de boa sombra com um naturalista algo romântico, imaginando-se que por ali turbilhonaram, largo
tempo, na idade terciária, as vagas e as correntes.
Porque, a despeito da escassez de dados permitindo uma dessas profecias retrospectivas, no dizer elegante
de Huxley, capaz de esboçar a situação daquela zona em idades remotas, todos os caracteres que sumariamos
reforçam a concepção aventurosa.
Alentam-na ainda: o estranho desnudamento da terra; os alinhamentos notáveis em que jazem os materiais
fraturados, orlando, em verdadeiras curvas de nível, os flancos das serranias; as escarpas dos tabuleiros
terminando em taludes a prumo, que recordam falaises; e, até certo ponto, os restos da fauna pliocena, que fazem
dos caldeirões enormes ossuários de mastodontes, cheios de vértebras caldeirões desconjuntadas e partidas,
como se ali a vida fosse, de chofre, salteada e extinta pelas energias revoltas de um cataclismo.
Há também a presunção derivada de situação anterior, exposta em dados positivos. As pesquisas de Fred.
Hartt, de fato, estabelecem, nas terras circunjacentes a Paulo Afonso, a existência de inegáveis bacias cretáceas;
e sendo os fósseis que as definem idênticos aos encontrados no Peru e México, e contemporâneos dos que
Agassiz descobriu no Panamá — todos estes elementos se acolchetam no deduzir-se que vasto oceano cretáceo
rolou as suas ondas sobre as terras fronteiras das duas Américas, ligando o Atlântico ao Pacífico. Cobria, assim,
grande parte dos Estados setentrionais brasileiros, indo bater contra os terraços superiores dos planaltos, onde
extensos depósitos sedimentários denunciam idade mais antiga, o paleozóico médio.
Então, destacadas das grandes ilhas emergentes, as grimpas mais altas das nossas cordilheiras mal
apontavam ao norte, na solidão imensa das águas...
Não existiam os Andes o Amazonas, largo canal entre altiplanuras das Guianas e as do continente,
separava-as, ilhadas. Para as bandas do sul o maciço de Goiás — o mais antigo do mundo — segundo a dedução
dedução de Gerber, o de Minas e parte do Planalto Paulista, onde fulgurava, em plena atividade, o vulcão de
Caldas, constituíam o núcleo do continente futuro . . .
Porque se operava lentamente uma sublevação geral: as Nassas graníticas alteavam-se ao norte arrastando o
conjunto geral das terras numa rotação vagarosa em torno de um eixo, imaginado por Em. Liais entre os
chapadões de Barbacena e a Bolívia. Simultaneamente ,ao abrir-se a época terciária, se realiza o fato prodigioso
do alevantamento dos Andes; novas terras afloram nas águas: tranca-se, num extremo, o canal amazônico,
transmudando-se no maior dos rios; ampliam-se os arquipélagos esparsos, e ganglionam-se em istmos, e
fundem-se; arredondam-se, maiores, os contornos das costas; e integra-se lentamente, a América.
Então os terrenos da extrema setentrional da Bahia, que se resumiam nos cachopos de quartzito de Monte
Santo e visos de Itiúba, esparsos pelas águas, avolumaram-se, num ascender contínuo. Elas nesse vagaroso
altear-se, enquanto as regiões mais altas recém-desvendadas, se salpintavam de lagos, toda a parte média daquela
escarpa permanecia imersa. Uma corrente impetuosa, de que é forma decaído a atual da nossa costa, enlaçava-a.
E embatendo-a longamente, domina enquanto o resto do país, ao sul, se erigia já constituído, e corroendo-a, e
triturando-a, remoinhando para oeste e arrebatando todos os materiais desagregados, modelava aquele recanto da
Bahia até que ele emergisse de todo, seguindo o movimento geral das terras, feito informe amontoado de
montanhas derruídas.
O regímen desértico ali se firmou, então, em flagrante antagonismo com as disposições geográficas: sobre
uma escarpa, onde nada recorda as depressões sem escoamento dos desertos clássicos.
Acredita-se que a região incipiente ainda está preparando-se para a Vida: o líquen ainda ataca a pedra,
fecundando a terra. E lutando tenazmente com o flagelar do clima, uma flora de resistência rara por ali entretece
a trama das raízes, obstando, em parte, que as torrentes arrebatem todos os princípios exsolvidos —
acumulando-os pouco a pouco na conquista da paragem desolada cujos contornos suaviza — sem impedir,
contudo, nos estios longos, as insolações inclementes e as águas selvagens, degradando o solo.
Daí a impressão dolorosa que nos domina ao atravessarmos aquele ignoto trecho do sertão — quase um
deserto — quer se aperte entre as dobras de serranias nuas ou se estire, monotonamente, em descampados
grandes...
Capítulo II
Golpe de vista do alto de Monte Santo
Do alto da serra de Monte Santo atentando-se para a região, estendida em torno num raio de quinze léguas,
nota-se, como num mapa em relevo, a sua conformação orográfica. E vê-se que as cordas de serras, ao invés de
se alongarem para o nascente, medianas aos traçados do Vaza-Barris e Itapicuru, formando-lhes o divortium
aquarum, progridem para o norte.
Mostram-no as serras Grande e do Atanásio, correndo, e a princípio distintas, uma para NO e outra para N e
fundindo-se na do Acaru, onde abrolham os mananciais intermitentes do Bendegó e seus tributários efêmeros.
Unificadas, aliam-se às de Caraíbas e do Lopes e nestas de novo se embebem, formando-se as massas do
Cambaio, de onde irradiam as pequenas cadeias do Coxomongó e Calumbi, e para o noroeste os píncaros
torreantes do Caipã. Obediente à mesma tendência, a do Aracati, lançando-se a NO, à borda dos tabuleiros de
Jeremoabo, progride, descontínua, naquele rumo e, depois de entalhada pelo Vaza-Barris em Cocorobó, inflete
para o poente, repartindo-se nas da Canabrava e Poço-de-Cima, que a prolongam. Todas traçam, afinal, elítica
curva fechada ao sul por um morro, o da Favela, em torno de larga planura ondeante onde se erigia o arraial de
Canudos — e daí para o norte, de novo se dispersam e decaem até acabarem em chapadas altas à borda do S.
Francisco.
Deste modo, no ascender para o norte, procurando o chapadão que o Parnaíba escava, aquele talude dos planaltos
parece dobrar-se num ressalto, perturbando toda a área de drenagem do S. Francisco abaixo da confluência do
Patamuté, num traçado de torrentes sem nome, inapreciáveis na mais favorável escala, e impondo ao Vaza-Barris
um curso tortuoso do qual ele se liberta em Jeremoabo, ao infletir para a costa.
Este é um rio sem afluentes. Falta-lhe conformidade com o declive da terra. Os seus pequenas tributários, o
Bendegó e Caraíbas, volvendo águas transitórias, dentro dos leitos rudemente escavados, não traduzem as
depressões do solo. Têm a existência fugitiva das estações chuvosas. São, antes, canais de esgotamento, abertos a
esmo pelos enxurros — ou correntes velozes que, adstritas aos relevos topográficos mais próximos, estão, não
raro, em desarmonia com as disposições orográficas gerais. São rios que sobem. Enchem-se de súbito;
transbordam; reprofundam os leitos, anulando o obstáculo do declive geral do solo; rolam por alguns dias para o
rio principal; e desaparecem, volvendo ao primitivo aspecto de valos em torcicolos, cheios de pedras, e secos.
O próprio Vaza-Barris, rio sem nascentes em cujo leito viçam gramíneas e pastam os rebanhos, não teria o
traçado atual se corrente perene lhe assegurasse um perfil de equilíbrio através de esforço contínuo e longo. A
sua função como agente geológico é revolucionária. As mais vezes cortado, fracionando-se em gânglios
estagnados, ou seco, à maneira de larga estrada poenta e tortuosa, quando cresce, empanzinado, nas cheias,
captando as águas selvagens que estrepitam nos pendores, volve por algumas semanas águas barrentas e revoltas,
extinguindo-se logo em esgotamento completo, vazando, como o indica o dizer português, substituindo-lhe com
vantagem a antiga denominação indígena. É uma onda tombando das vertentes da Itiúba, multiplicando a energia
da corrente no apertado dos desfiladeiros, e correndo veloz entre barrancos, ou entalada em serras, até
Jeremoabo.
Vimos como a natureza, em roda, lhe imita o regímen brutal — calcando-o em terreno agro, sem os cenários
opulentos das serras e dos tabuleiros ou dos sem-fins das chapadas — mas feito um misto em que tais
disposições naturais se baralham, em confusão pasmosa: planícies que de perto revelam séries de cômoros,
retalhados de algares; morros que o contraste das várzeas faz de grande altura e estão poucas dezenas de metros
sobre o solo, e tabuleiros que em sendo percorridos mostram a acidentação caótica de boqueirões escancelados e
brutos. Nada mais dos belos efeitos das denudações lentas, no remodelar os pendores, no despertar os horizontes
e no desatar — amplíssimos — os gerais pelo teso das cordilheiras, dando aos quadros naturais a encantadora
grandeza de perspectivas em que o céu e a terra se fundem em difusão longínqua e surpreendedora de cores...
Entretanto, inesperado quadro esperava o viandante que subia, depois desta travessia em que supõe pisar
escombros de terremotos, as ondulações mais próximas de Canudos.
Do alto da Favela
Galgava o topo da Favela. Volvia em volta o olhar para abranger de um lance o conjunto da terra. E nada mais
divisava recordando-lhe os cenários contemplados. Tinha na frente a antítese do que vira. Ali estavam os
mesmos acidentes e o mesmo chão, embaixo, fundamente revolto, sob o indumento áspero dos pedregais e
caatingas estonadas... Mas a reunião de tantos traços incorretos e duros — arregoados divagantes de algares,
sulcos de despenhadeiros, socavas de bocainas, criava-lhe perspectiva inteiramente nova. E quase compreendia
que os matutos crendeiros de imaginativa ingênua, acreditassem que ""ali era o céu...”.
O arraial, adiante e embaixo, erigia-se no mesmo solo perturbado. Mas vistos daquele ponto, de permeio a
distância suavizando-lhes as encostas e aplainando-os — todos os serrotes breves e inúmeros, projetando-se em
plano inferior e estendendo-se, uniformes, pelos quadrantes, davam-lhe a ilusão de uma planície ondulante e
grande.
Em roda uma elipse majestosa de montanhas...
A Canabrava, a nordeste, de perfil abaulado e simples; a do Poço de cima, próxima, mas íngreme e alta; a de
Cocorobó, no levante, ondulando em seladas, dispersa em esporões; as vertentes retilíneas do Calumbi ao sul; as
grimpas do Cambaio, no correr para o poente; e, para o norte, os contornos agitados do Caipã —ligam-se e
articulam-se no infletir gradual traçando, fechada, a curva desmedida.
Vendo ao longe, quase de nível, trancando-lhe o horizonte, aquelas grimpas altaneiras, o observador tinha a
impressão alentadora de se achar sobre plateau elevadíssimo, páramo incomparável repousando sobre as serras.
Na planície rugada, embaixo, mal se lobrigavam os pequenos cursos d'água, divagando, serpeantes...
Um único se distinguia, o Vaza-Barris. Atravessava-a, torcendo-se em meandros. Presa numa dessas voltas
via-se uma depressão maior, circundada de colinas... E atulhando-a, enchendo-a toda de confusos tetos
incontáveis, um acervo enorme de casebres...
Capítulo III
O clima
Dos breves apontamentos indicados, resulta que os caracteres geológicos e topográficos, a par dos demais
agentes físicos, mutuam naqueles lugares as influências características de modo a não se poder afirmar qual o
preponderante.
Se, por um lado, as condições genéticas reagem fortemente sobre os últimos, estes, por sua vez,
contribuíram para o agravamento daquelas; e todas persistem nas influência recíprocas. Deste perene conflito
feito num círculo vicioso indefinido, ressalta a dignificação mesológica do local. Não há abrangê-la em todas
modalidades. Escasseiam-nos as observações às coisas desta terra, com uma inércia cômoda de mendigos fartos.
Nenhum pioneiro da ciência suportou ainda as agruras daquele rincão sertanejo, em prazo suficiente para o
definir.
Martius por lá passou, com a mira essencial de observar o aerólito, que tombara à margem do Bendegó e
era já, desde 1810, conhecido nas academias européias, graças a F. Mornay e Wollaston. Rompendo, porém, a
região selvagem, desertus austral, como a batizou, mal atentou para a teria recamada de uma flora extravagante,
sylva horrida, no seu latim alarmado. Os que o antecederam e sucederam palmilharam, ferretoados da canícula,
as mesmas trilhas rápidas, de quem foge. De sorte que sempre evitado, aquele sertão, até hoje desconhecido,
ainda o será por muito tempo.
O que se segue são vagas conjeturas. Atravessamo-lo no prelúdio de um estio ardente e, vendo-o apenas nessa
quadra, vimo-lo sob o pior aspecto. O que escrevemos tem o traço defeituoso dessa impressão isolada,
desfavorecida, ademais, por um meio contraposto à serenidade do pensamento, tolhido pelas emoções da guerra.
Além disto os dados de um termômetro único e de um aneróide suspeito, misérrimo arsenal científico com que
ali lidamos, nem mesmo vagos lineamentos darão de climas que divergem segundo as menores disposições
topográficas, criando aspectos díspares entre lugares limítrofes. O de Monte Santo, por ex., que é, ao primeiro
comparar, muito superior ao de Queimadas, diverge do dos lugares que lhe demoram ao norte, sem a
continuidade que era lícito prever de sua situação intermédia. A proximidade das massas montanhosas torna-o
estável, lembrando um regímen marítimo em pleno continente: escala térmica oscilando em amplitudes
insignificantes; firmamento onde a transparência dos ares é completa e a limpidez inalterável; e ventos reinantes,
o SE no inverno e o NE no estio — alternando-se com rigorismo raro. Mas está insulado. Para qualquer das
bandas, deixa-o o viajante num dia de viagem. Se vai para o norte, salteiam-no transições fortíssimas: a
temperatura aumenta; carrega-se o azul dos céus; embaciam-se os ares; e as ventanias rolam desorientadamente
de todos os quadrantes — ante a tiragem intensa dos terrenos desabrigados, que dali por diante se estiram. Ao
mesmo tempo espelha-se o regímen excessivo: o termômetro oscila em graus disparatados passando, já em
outubro, dos dias com 35° à sombra para as madrugadas frias.
No ascender do verão acentua-se o desequilíbrio. Crescem a um tempo as máximas e as mínimas, até que no
fastígio das secas transcorram as horas num intermitir inaturável de dias queimosos e noites enregeladas.
A terra desnuda tendo contrapostas, em permanente conflito, as capacidades emissiva e absorvente dos
materiais que a formam, do mesmo passo armazena os ardores das soalheiras e deles se esgota, de improviso.
Insola-se e enregela-se, em 24 horas. Fere-a o sol e ela absorve-lhe os raios, e multiplica-os e reflete-os, e
refrata-os, num reverberar ofuscante: pelo topo dos cerros, pelo esbarrancado das encostas, incendeiam-se as
acendalhas da sílica fraturada, rebrilhantes, numa trama vibrátil de centelhas; a atmosfera junto ao chão vibra
num ondular vivíssimo de bocas de fornalha em que se pressente visível, no expandir das colunas aquecidas, a
efervescência dos ares; e o dia, incomparável no fulgor, fulmina a natureza silenciosa, em cujo seio se abate,
imóvel, na quietude de um longo espasmo, a galhada sem folhas da flora sucumbida.
Desce a noite, sem crepúsculo, de chofre — um salto da treva por cima de uma franja vermelha do poente — e
todo este calor se perde no espaço numa irradiação intensíssima, caindo a temperatura de súbito, numa queda
única, assombrosa . . .
Ocorrem, todavia, variantes cruéis. Propelidas pelo nordeste, espessas nuvens, tufando em cúmulos, pairam
ao entardecer sobre as areias incendidas. Desaparece o sol e a coluna mercurial permanece imóvel, ou, de
preferência, sobe. A noite sobrevém em fogo; a terra irradia como um sol escuro, porque se sente uma dolorosa
impressão de faúlhas invisíveis; mas toda a ardência reflui sobre ela, recambiada pelas nuvens. O barômetro cai,
como nas proximidades das tormentas; e mal se respira no bochorno inaturável em que toda a adustão golfada
pela soalheira se concentra numa hora única da noite.
Por um contraste explicável, este fato jamais sucede nos paroxismos estivais das secas, em que prevalece a
intercadência de dias esbraseados e noites frigidíssimas, agravando todas as angústias dos martirizados
sertanejos.
Copiando o mesmo singular desequilíbrio das forças que trabalham a terra, os ventos ali chegam, em geral,
turbilhonando revoltos, em rebojos largos. E, nos meses em que se acentua, o nordeste grava em tudo sinais que
lhe recordam o rumo.
Estas agitações dos ares desaparecem, entretanto, por longos meses; reinando calmarias pesadas — ares
imóveis sob a placidez luminosa dos dias causticantes. Imperceptíveis exercem-se, então, as correntes
ascensionais dos vapores aquecidos sugando à terra a umidade exígua; e quando se prolongam, esboçando o
prelúdio entristecedor da seca, a secura da atmosfera atinge a graus anormalíssimos.
Higrômetros singulares
Não a observamos através do rigorismo de processos clássicos, mas graças a higrômetros inesperados e
bizarros.
Percorrendo certa vez, nos fins de setembro, as cercanias de Canudos, fugindo à monotonia de um
canhoneio frouxo de tiros espaçados e soturnos, encontramos, no descer de uma encosta, anfiteatro irregular,
onde as colinas se dispunham circulando a um vale único. Pequenos arbustos, icozeiros virentes viçando em
tufos intermeados de palmatórias de flores rutilantes, davam ao lugar a aparência exata de algum velho jardim
em abandono. Ao lado uma árvore única, uma quixabeira alta, sobranceando a vegetação franzina.
O sol poente desatava, longa, a sua sombra pelo chão, e protegido por ela — braços largamente abertos, face
volvida para os céus, — um soldado descansava.
Descansava... havia três meses.
Morrera no assalto de 18 de julho. A coronha da mannlicher estrondada, o cinturão e o boné jogados a uma
banda, e a farda em tiras, diziam que sucumbira em luta corpo a corpo com adversário possante. Caíra, certo,
derreando-se à violenta pancada que lhe sulcara a fronte, manchada de uma escara preta. E ao enterrar-se, dias
depois, os mortos, não fora percebido. Não compartira, por isto, à vala comum de menos de um côvado de fundo
em que eram jogados, formando pela última vez juntos, os companheiros abatidos na batalha. O destino que o
removera do lar desprotegido fizera-lhe afinal uma concessão: livrara-o da promiscuidade lúgubre de um fosso
repugnante; e deixara-o ali há três meses — braços largamente abertos, rosto voltado para os céus, para os sóis
ardentes, para os luares claros, para as estrelas fulgurantes...
E estava intacto. Murchara apenas. Mumificara conservando os traços fisionômicos, de modo a incutir a
ilusão exata de um lutador cansado, retemperando-se em tranqüilo sono, à sombra daquela árvore benfazeja.
Nem um verme — o mais vulgar dos trágicos analistas da matéria — lhe maculara os tecidos. Volvia ao
turbilhão da vida sem decomposição repugnante, numa exaustão imperceptível. Era um aparelho revelando de
modo absoluto, mas sugestivo, a secura extrema dos ares.
Os cavalos mortos naquele mesmo dia semelhavam espécimens empalhados, de museus. O pescoço apenas mais
alongado e fino, as pernas ressequidas e o arcabouço engelhado e duro.
À entrada do acampamento, em Canudos, um deles, sobre todos, se destacava impressionadoramente. Fora a
montada de um valente, o alferes Wanderley; e abatera-se, morto juntamente com o cavaleiro. Ao resvalar,
porém, estrebuchando malferido, pela rampa íngreme, quedou, adiante, à meia encosta, entalado entre fraguedos.
Ficou quase em pé, com as patas dianteiras firmes num ressalto da pedra... E ali estacou feito um animal
fantástico, aprumado sobre a ladeira, num quase curvetear, no último arremesso da carga paralisada, com todas
as aparências de vida, sobretudo quando, ao passarem as rajadas ríspidas do nordeste, se lhe agitavam as longas
crinas ondulantes . . .
Quando aquelas lufadas, caindo a súbitas, se compunham com as colunas ascendentes, em remoinhos
turbilhonantes, à maneira de minúsculos ciclones, sentia-se, maior, a exsicação do ambiente adusto: cada
partícula de areia suspensa do solo gretado e duro irradiava em todos os sentidos, feito um foco calorífico, a
surda combustão da terra.
Fora disto — nas longas calmarias, fenômenos óticos bizarros.
Do topo da Favela, se a prumo dardejava o sol e a atmosfera estagnada imobilizava a natureza em torno,
atentando-se para os descambados, ao longe, não se distinguia o solo.
O olhar fascinado perturbava-se no desequilíbrio das camadas desigualmente aquecidas, parecendo varar
através de um prisma desmedido e intáctil, e não distinguia a base das montanhas, como que suspensas. Então,
ao norte da Canabrava, numa enorme expansão dos plainos perturbados, via-se um ondular estonteador; estranho
palpitar de vagas longínquas; a ilusão maravilhosa de um seio de mar, largo, irisado, sobre que caísse, e
refrangesse, e ressaltasse a luz esparsa em cintilações ofuscantes...
Capítulo IV
As secas
O sertão de Canudos é um índice sumariando a fisiografia dos sertões do Norte. Resume-os, enfeixa os seus
aspectos predominantes numa escala reduzida. É-lhes de algum modo uma zona central comum.
De fato, a inflexão peninsular, extremada pelo cabo de S. Roque, faz que para ele convirjam as lindes interiores
de seis Estados — Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco, Paraíba, Ceará e Piauí — que o tocam ou demoram distantes
poucas léguas.
Desse modo é natural que as vicissitudes climáticas daqueles nele se exercitem com a mesma intensidade,
nomeadamente em sua manifestação mais incisiva, definida numa palavra que é o terror máximo dos rudes
partícios que por ali se agitam — a seca.
Escusamo-nos de longamente a estudar, averbando o desbarate dos mais robustos espíritos no aprofundar-lhe a
gênese, tateantes ao través de sem número de agentes complexos e fugitivos. Indiquemos, porém, inscrita num
traçado de números inflexíveis, esta fatalidade inexorável.
De fato, os seus ciclos — porque o são no rigorismo técnico do termo — abrem-se e encerram-se com um ritmo
tão notável que recordam o desdobramento de uma lei natural, ainda ignorada.
Revelou-o, pela primeira vez, o senador Tomás Pompeu, traçando um quadro por si mesmo bastante eloqüente,
em que os aparecimentos das secas, no século passado e atual, se defrontam em paralelismo singular, sendo de
presumir que ligeiras discrepâncias indiquem apenas defeitos de observação ou desvios na tradição oral que as
registrou.
De qualquer modo ressalta à simples contemplação uma coincidência repetida bastante para que se remova a
intrusão do acaso.
Assim, para citarmos apenas as maiores, as secas de (1710-1711), (1723-1727), (1736-1737), (1744-1745),
(1777-1778), do século 18, se justapõem às de ( 1808-1809 ), ( 1824-1825 ) (1835-1837), (1844-1845),
(1877-1879), do atual.
Esta coincidência, espelhando-se quase invariável, como se surgisse do decalque de uma quadra sobre outra,
acentua-se ainda na identidade das quadras remansadas e longas que, em ambas, atreguaram a progressão dos
estragos.
De fato, sendo, no século passado, o maior interregno de 32 anos (1745-1777), houve no nosso outro
absolutamente igual e, o que é sobremaneira notável, com a correspondência exatíssima das datas (1845-1877).
Continuando num exame mais íntimo do quadro, destacam-se novos dados fixos e positivos, aparecendo com um
rigorismo de incógnitas que se desvendam. Observa-se, então, uma cedência raro perturbada na marcha do
flagelo, intercortado de intervalos pouco díspares entre nove e doze anos, e sucedendo-se de maneira a
permitirem previsões seguras sobre a sua irrupção.
Entretanto, apesar desta simplicidade extrema nos resultados imediatos, o problema, que se pode traduzir na
fórmula aritmética mais simples, permanece insolúvel.
Hipóteses sobre a gênese das secas
Impressionado pela razão desta progressão raro alterada, e fixando-a um tanto forçadamente em doze anos, um
naturalista, o barão de Capanema, teve o pensamento de rastrear nos fatos extraterrestres, tão característicos
pelos períodos invioláveis em que se sucedem, a sua origem remota. E encontrou na regularidade com que
repontam e se extinguem, intermitentemente, as manchas da fotosfera solar, um símile completo.
De fato, aqueles núcleos obscuros, alguns mais vastos que a Terra, negrejando dentro da cercadura fulgurante
das fáculas, lentamente derivando à feição da rotação do Sol, têm entre o máximo e o mínimo da intensidade, um
período que pode variar de nove a doze anos. E como desde muito a intuição genial de Herschel lhes descobrira
o influxo apreciável na dosagem de calor emitido para a Terra, a correlação surgia inabalável, neste estear-se em
dados geométricos e físicos acolchetando-se num efeito único.
Restava equiparar o mínimo das manchas, anteparo à irradiação do grande astro, ao fastígio das secas no planeta
torturado — de modo a patentear, cômpares, os períodos de umas e outras.
Falhou neste ponto, em que pese à sua forma atraentíssima, a teoria planeada: raramente coincidem as datas do
paroxismo estival, no Norte, com as daquele.
O malogro desta tentativa, entretanto, denuncia menos a desvalia de uma aproximação imposta rigorosamente
por circunstâncias tão notáveis, do que o exclusivismo de atentar-se para uma causa única. Porque a questão,
com a complexidade imanente aos fatos concretos, se atém, de preferência, a razões secundárias, mais próximas
e enérgicas, e estas, em modalidades progredindo, contínuas, da natureza do solo à disposição geográfica, só
serão definitivamente sistematizadas quando extensa série de observações permitir a definição dos agentes
preponderantes do clima sertanejo.
Como quer que seja, o penoso regímen dos Estados do Norte está em função de agentes desordenados e
fugitivos, sem leis ainda definidas, sujeitas às perturbações locais, derivadas da natureza da terra, e a reações
mais amplas, promanadas das disposições geográficas. Daí as correntes aéreas que o desequilibram e variam.
Determina-o em grande parte, e talvez de modo preponderante, a monção de nordeste, oriunda da forte aspiração
dos planaltos interiores que, em vasta superfície alargada até ao Mato Grosso, são, como se sabe, sede de
grandes depressões barométricas, no estio. Atraído por estas, o nordeste vivo, ao entrar, de dezembro a março,
pelas costas setentrionais, é singularmente favorecido pela própria conformação da terra, na passagem célere por
sobre os chapadões desnudos que irradiando intensamente lhe alteiam o ponto de saturação diminuindo as
probabilidades das chuvas, e repelindo-o, de modo a lhe permitir acarretar para os recessos do continente,
intacta, sobre os mananciais dos grandes rios, toda a umidade absorvida na travessia dos mares.
De fato, a disposição orográfica dos sertões, à parte ligeiras variantes — cordas de serras que se alinham para
nordeste paralelamente à monção reinante — , facilita a travessia desta. Canaliza-a. Não a contrabate num
antagonismo de encostas, abarreirando-a, alteando-a, provocando-lhe resfriamento e a condensação em chuvas.
Um dos motivos das secas repousa, assim, na disposição topográfica.
Falta às terras flageladas do Norte uma alta serrania que, correndo em direção perpendicular àquele vento,
determine a dynamic colding, consoante um dizer expressivo.
Um fato natural de ordem mais elevada esclarece esta hipótese.
Assim é que as secas aparecem sempre entre duas datas fixadas há muito pela prática dos sertanejos, de 12 de
dezembro a 19 de março. Fora de tais limites não há um exemplo único de extinção de secas. Se os atravessam,
prolongam-se fatalmente por todo o decorrer do ano, até que se reabra outra vez aquela quadra. Sendo assim e
lembrando-nos que é precisamente dentro deste intervalo que a longa faixa das calmas equatoriais, no seu lento
oscilar em torno do equador, paira no zênite daqueles Estados. levando a borda até aos extremos da Bahia, não
poderemos considerá-la, para o caso, com a função de uma montanha ideal que correndo de leste a oeste
corrigindo momentaneamente lastimável disposição orográfica, se anteponha a monção e lhe provoque a parada,
a ascensão das correntes, o resfriamento subseqüente e a condensação imediata nos aguaceiros diluvianos que
tombam então, de súbito, sobre os sertões ?
Este desfiar de conjeturas tem o valor de indicar quantos fatores remotos podem incidir numa questão que
duplamente nos interessa pelo seu traço superior na ciência, e pelo seu significado mais íntimo no envolver o
destino de extenso trato do nosso país. Remove, por isto, a segundo plano o influxo até hoje inutilmente agitado
dos alísios, e é de alguma sorte fortalecido pela intuição do próprio sertanejo para quem a persistência do
nordeste — o vento da seca, como o batiza expressivamente — equivale à permanência de uma situação
irremediável e crudelíssima.
As quadras benéficas chegam de improviso.
Depois de dois ou três anos, como de 1877-1879, em que a insolação rescalda intensamente as chapadas
desnudas, a sua própria intensidade origina um reagente inevitável. Decai afinal, por toda a parte, de modo
considerável, a pressão atmosférica. Apruma-se maior e mais bem definida, a barreira das correntes ascensionais
dos ares aquecidos, antepostas às que entram pelo litoral. E entrechocadas umas e outras, num desencadear de
tufões violentos, alteiam-se, retalhadas de raios, nublando em minutos o firmamento todo, desfazendo-se logo
depois em aguaceiros fortes sobre os desertos recrestados.
Então parece tornar-se visível o anteparo das colunas ascendentes, que determinam o fenômeno, na colisão
formidável com o nordeste.
Segundo numerosas testemunhas — as primeiras bátegas despenhadas da altura não atingem a terra. A meio
caminho se evaporam entre as camadas referventes que sobem, e volvem, repelidas, às nuvens, para, outra vez
condensando-se, precipitarem-se de novo e novamente refluírem; até tocarem o solo que a princípio não
umedecem, tornando ainda aos espaços com rapidez maior, numa vaporização quase como se houvessem caído
sobre chapas incandescentes, para mais uma vez descerem, numa permuta rápida e contínua, até que se formem,
afinal, os primeiros fios de água derivando pelas pedras, as primeiras torrentes em despenhos pelas encostas,
afluindo em regatos já avolumados entre as quebradas, concentrando-se tumultuariamente em ribeirões
correntosos; adensando-se, estes, em rios barrentos traçados ao acaso, à feição dos declives, em cujas correntezas
passam velozmente os esgalhos das árvores arrancadas, rolando todos e arrebentando na mesma onda, no mesmo
caos de águas revoltas e escuras...
Se ao assalto subitâneo se sucedem as chuvas regulares, transmudam-se os sertões, revivescendo. Passam, porém
não raro, num giro célere, de ciclone. A drenagem rápida do terreno e a evaporação, que se estabelece logo mais
viva, tornam-nos, outra vez, desolados e áridos. E penetrando-lhes a atmosfera ardente, os ventos duplicam a
capacidade higrométrica, e vão, dia a dia, absorvendo a umidade exígua da terra —reabrindo o ciclo inflexível
das secas...
As caatingas
Então, a travessia das veredas sertanejas é mais exaustiva que a de uma estepe nua.
Nesta, ao menos, o viajante tem o desafogo de um horizonte largo e a perspectiva das planuras francas.
Ao passo que a caatinga o afoga; abrevia-lhe o olhar; agride-o e estonteia-o; enlaça-o na trama espinescente e
não o atrai; repulsa-o com as folhas urticantes, com o espinho, com os gravetos estalados em lanças; e
desdobra-se-lhe na frente léguas e léguas, imutável no aspecto desolado: árvores sem folhas, de galhos estorcidos
e secos, revoltos, entrecruzados, apontando rijamente no espaço ou estirando-se flexuosos pelo solo, lembrando
um bracejar imenso, de tortura, da flora agonizante . . .
Embora esta não tenha as espécies reduzidas dos desertos — mimosas tolhiças ou eufórbias ásperas sobre o
tapete das gramíneas murchas — e se afigure farta de vegetais distintos, as suas árvores, vistas em conjunto,
semelham uma só família de poucos gêneros, quase reduzida a uma espécie invariável, divergindo apenas no
tamanho, tendo todas a mesma conformação, a mesma aparência de vegetais morrendo, quase sem troncos, em
esgalhos logo ao irromper do chão. É que por um efeito explicável de adaptação às condições estreitas do meio
ingrato, evolvendo penosamente em círculos estreitos, aquelas mesmo que tanto se diversificam nas matas ali se
talham por um molde único. Transmudam-se, e em lenta metamorfose vão tendendo para limitadíssimo número
de tipos caracterizados pelos atributos dos que possuem maior capacidade de resistência.
Esta impõe-se, tenaz e inflexível.
A luta pela vida, que nas florestas se traduz como uma tendência irreprimível para a luz, desatando-se os
arbustos em cipós, elásticos, distensos, fugindo ao afogado das sombras e alteando-se presos mais aos raios do
Sol do que aos troncos seculares de ali, de todo oposta, é mais obscura, é mais original, é mais comovedora. O
Sol é o inimigo que é forçoso evitar, iludir ou combater. E evitando-o pressente-se de algum modo, como o
indicaremos adiante, a inumação da flora moribunda, enterrando-se os caules pelo solo. Mas como este, por seu
turno, é áspero e duro, exsicado pelas drenagens dos pendores ou esterilizado pela sucção dos estratos
completando as insolações, entre dois meios desfavoráveis — espaços candentes e terrenos agros —as plantas
mais robustas trazem no aspecto anormalíssimo, impressos, todos os estigmas desta batalha surda.
As leguminosas, altaneiras noutros lugares, ali se tornam anãs. Ao mesmo tempo ampliam o âmbito das frondes,
alargando a superfície de contato com o ar, para a absorção dos escassos elementos nele difundidos. Atrofiam as
raízes mestras batendo contra o subsolo impenetrável e substituem-nas pela expansão irradiante das radículas
secundárias, ganglionando-as em tubérculos túmidos de seiva. Amiúdam as folhas. Fitam-nas rijamente, duras
como cisalhas, à ponta dos galhos para diminuírem o campo da insolação. Revestem de um indumento protetor
os frutos, rígidos, às vezes, como estróbilos. Dão-lhes na deiscência perfeita com que as vagens se abrem,
estalando como se houvessem molas de aço, admiráveis aparelhos para propagação das sementes, espalhando-as
profusamente pelo chão. E têm, todas, sem excetuar uma única, no perfume suavíssimo das flores , anteparos
intácteis que nas noites frias sobre elas se alevantam e se arqueiam obstando a que sofram de chofre as quedas de
temperatura, tendas invisíveis e encantadoras, resguardando-as...
Assim disposta, a árvore aparelha-se para reagir contra o regímen bruto.
Ajusta-se sobre os sertões o cautério das secas; esterilizam-se os ares urentes; empedra-se o chão, gretando,
recrestado; ruge o nordeste nos ermos; e, como um cilício dilacerador, a caatinga estende sobre a terra as
ramagens de espinhos... Mas, reduzidas todas as funções, a planta, estivando, em vida latente, alimenta-se das
reservas que armazena nas quadras remansadas e rompe os estios, pronta a transfigurar-se entre os
deslumbramentos da primavera.
Algumas, em terrenos mais favoráveis, iludem ainda melhor as intempéries, em disposição singularíssima.
Vêem-se numerosos aglomerados em capões ou salpintando, isolados, as macegas, arbúsculos de pouco mais de
metro de alto, de largas folhas espessas e luzidias, exuberando floração ridente em meio da desolação geral. São
os cajueiros anões, os típicos anacardia humilis das chapadas áridas, os cajuís dos indígenas. Estes vegetais
estranhos, quando ablaqueados em roda, mostram raízes que se entranham a surpreendente profundura. Não há
desenraizá-los. O eixo descendente aumenta-lhes maior à medida que se escava. Por fim se nota que ele vai
repartindo-se em divisões dicotômicas. Progride pela terra dentro até a um caule único e vigoroso, embaixo.
Não são raízes, são galhos. E os pequeninos arbúsculos, esparsos, ou repontando em tufos, abrangendo às vezes
largas áreas, uma árvore única e enorme, inteiramente soterrada.
Espancado pelas canículas, fustigado dos sóis, roído dos enxurros, torturado pelos ventos, o vegetal parece
derrear-se aos embates desses elementos antagônicos e abroquelar-se daquele modo, invisível, no solo sobre que
alevanta apenas os mais altos renovos da fronde majestosa.
Outros, sem esta conformação, se aparelham de outra sorte.
As águas que fogem no volver selvagem das torrentes, ou entre as camadas inclinadas dos xistos, ficam retidas,
longo tempo, nas espatas das bromélias, aviventando-as. No pino dos verões, um pé de macambira é para o
matuto sequioso um copo d'água cristalina e pura. Os caroás verdoengos, de flores triunfais e altas; os gravatás e
ananases bravos, trançados em touceiras impenetráveis, copiam-lhe a mesma forma, adrede feita àquelas
paragens estéreis. As suas folhas ensiformes, lisas e lustrosas, como as da maioria dos vegetais sertanejos,
facilitam a condensação dos vapores escassos trazidos pelos ventos, por maneira a debelar-se o perigo máximo à
vida vegetativa, resultante de larga evaporação pelas folhas, esgotando e vencendo a absorção pelas radículas.
Sucedem-se outros, diversamente apercebidos, sob novos aprestos, mas igualmente resistentes.
As nopaleas e cactus, nativas em toda a parte, entram na categoria das fontes vegetais, de Saint-Hilaire. Tipos
clássicos da flora desértica, mais resistentes que os demais, quando decaem a seu lado, fulminadas, as árvores
todas, persistem inalteráveis ou mais vívidos talvez. Afeiçoaram-se aos regímens bárbaros; repelem os climas
benignos em que estiolam e definham. Ao passo que o ambiente em fogo dos desertos parece estimular melhor a
circulação da seiva entre os seus cladódios túmidos.
As favelas, anônimas ainda na ciência — ignoradas dos sábios, conhecidas demais pelos tabaréus —talvez um
futuro gênero cauterium das leguminosas, têm, nas folhas de células alongadas em vilosidades, notáveis aprestos
de condensação, absorção e defesa. Por um lado, a sua epiderme ao resfriar-se, à noite, muito abaixo da
temperatura do ar, provoca, a despeito da secura deste, breves precipitações de orvalho; por outro, a mão, que a
toca, toca uma chapa incandescente de ardência inaturável.
Ora, quando ao revés das anteriores as espécies não se mostram tão bem armadas para a reação vitoriosa,
observam-se dispositivos porventura mais interessantes: unem-se, intimamente abraçadas, transmudando-se em
plantas sociais. Não podendo revidar isoladas, disciplinam-se, congregam-se, arregimentam-se. São deste
número todas as cesalpinas e as catingueiras, constituindo, nos trechos em que aparecem, sessenta por cento das
caatingas; os alecrins-dos-tabuleiros, e os canudos-de-pito, heliotrópios arbustivos de caule oco, pintalgado de
branco e flores em espiga, destinados a emprestar o nome ao mais lendário dos vilarejos...
Não estão no quadro das plantas sociais brasileiras, de Humboldt, e é possível que as primeiras vicejem, noutros
climas, isoladas. Ali se associam. E, estreitamente solidárias as suas raízes, no subsolo, em apertada trama, retém
as águas, retêm as terras que se desagregam, e formam, ao cabo, num longo esforço, o solo arável em que
nascem, vencendo, pela capilaridade do inextricável tecido de radículas enredadas em malhas numerosas, a
sucção insaciável dos estratos e das areias. E vivem. Vivem é o termo — porque há, no fato, um traço superior à
passividade da evolução vegetativa...
O juazeiro
Têm o mesmo caráter os juazeiros, que raro perdem as folhas de um verde intenso, adrede modeladas às reações
vigorosas da luz. Sucedem-se meses e anos ardentes. Empobrece-se inteiramente o solo aspérrimo. Mas, nessas
quadras cruéis, em que as soalheiras se agravam, à vezes, com os incêndios espontaneamente acesos pelas
ventanias atritando rijamente os galhos secos e estonados sobre o depauperamento geral da vida, em roda, eles
agitam as ramagens virentes, alheios às estações, floridos sempre, salpintando o deserto com as flores cor de
ouro, álacres, esbatidas no pardo dos restolhos — à maneira de oásis verdejantes e festivos.
A dureza dos elementos cresce, entretanto, em certas quadras, ao ponto de os desnudar: é que se enterroaram há
muito os fundos das cacimbas, e os leitos endurecidos das ipueiras mostram, feito enormes carimbos, em moldes,
os rastros velhos das boiadas; e o sertão de todo se impropriou à vida.
Então, sobre a natureza morta, apenas se alteiam os cereus esguios e silentes, aprumando os caules circulares
repartidos em colunas poliédricas e uniformes, na simetria impecável de enormes candelabros. E avultando ao
descer das tardes breves sobre aqueles ermos, quando os abotoam grandes frutos vermelhos destacando-se,
nítidos, à meia luz dos crepúsculos, eles dão a ilusão emocionante de círios enormes, fincados a esmo no solo,
espalhados pelas chapadas, e acesos...
Caracterizam a flora caprichosa da plenitude do estio.
Os mandacarus ( cereus jaramacaru ), atingindo notável altura, raro aparecendo em grupos, assomando isolados
acima da vegetação caótica, são novidade atraente, a princípio. Atuam pelo contraste. Aprumam-se tesos
triunfalmente, enquanto por toda a banda a flora se deprime. O olhar, perturbado pelo acomodar-se à
contemplação penosa dos acervos de ramalhos estorcidos, descansa e retifica-se percorrendo os seus caules
direitos e corretos. No fim de algum tempo, porém, são uma obsessão acabrunhadora. Gravam em tudo
monotonia inaturável, sucedendo-se constantes, uniformes, idênticos todos, todos do mesmo porte, igualmente
afastados, distribuídos com uma ordem singular pelo deserto.
Os xiquexiques (cactus peruvianus) são uma variante de proporções inferiores, fracionando-se em ramos
fervilhantes de espinhos, recurvos e rasteiros, recamados de flores alvíssimas. Procuram os lugares ásperos e
ardentes. São os vegetais clássicos dos areais queimosos. Aprazem-se no leito abrasante das lajens graníticas
feridas pelos sóis.
Têm como sócios inseparáveis neste habitat, que as próprias orquídeas evitam, os cabeças-de-frade, deselegantes
e monstruosos melocactos de forma elipsoidal, acanalada, de gomos espinescentes, convergindo-lhes no vértice
superior formado uma flor única intensamente rubra. Aparecem de modo inexplicável, sobre a pedra nua, dando,
realmente, no tamanho, na conformação, no modo por que se espalham, a imagem singular de cabeças decepadas
e sanguinolentas jogadas por ali, a esmo, numa desordem trágica. É que estreitíssima frincha lhes permitiu
insinuar, através da rocha, a raiz longa e capilar até a parte inferior, onde acaso existam, livres de evaporação,
uns restos de umidade.
E a vasta família, revestindo todos os aspectos, decai, a pouco e pouco, até aos quipás reptantes, espinhosos,
humílimos, trançados sobre a terra à maneira de espartos de um capacho dilacerador; às ripsalides serpeantes,
flexuosas, como víboras verdes pelos ramos, de parceria com os frágeis cactos epifitas, de um glauco
empalecido, presos por adligantes aos estipites dos ouricurizeiros, fugindo do solo bárbaro para o remanso da
copa da palmeira.
Aqui, ali, outras modalidades: as palmatórias-do-inferno opúntias de palmas diminutas, diabolicamente erriçadas
de espinhos — com o vivo carmim das cochonilhas que alimentam; orladas de flores rutilantes, quebrando
alacremente a tristeza solene das paisagens...
E pouco mais especializa quem anda, pelos dias claros, por aqueles ermos, entre árvores sem folhas e sem flores.
Toda a flora, como em uma derrubada, se mistura em baralhamento indescritível. É a catanduva, mato doente, da
etimologia indígena, dolorosamente caída sobre o seu terrível leito de espinhos !
Vingado um cômoro qualquer, postas em torno as vistas, perturba-as o mesmo cenário desolador: a vegetação
agonizante, doente e informe, exausta, num espasmo doloroso...
É a sylva oestu aphylla, a sylva borrida, de Martius, abrindo no seio iluminado da natureza tropical um vácuo de
deserto.
Compreende-se, então, a verdade da frase paradoxal, de Aug. de Saint-Hilaire: ""Há, ali, toda a melancolia dos
invernos, com um sol ardente e os ardores do verão!""
A luz crua dos dias longos flameja sobre a terra imóvel e não a anima. Reverberam as infiltrações de quartzo
pelos cerros calcários, desordenadamente esparsos pelos ermos, num alvejar de banquises; e, oscilando à ponta
dos ramos secos das árvores inteiriçadas, dependuram-se as tilândsias alvacentas, lembrando flocos esgarçados,
de neve, dando ao conjunto o aspecto de uma paisagem glacial de vegetação hibernante, nos gelos . . .
A tormenta
Mas no empardecer de uma tarde qualquer, de março, rápidas tardes sem crepúsculos, prestes afogadas na noite,
as estrelas pela primeira vez cintilam vivamente.
Nuvens volumosas abarreiram ao longe os horizontes, recortando-os em relevos imponentes de montanhas
negras.
Sobem vagarosamente; incham, bolhando em lentos e desmesurados rebojos, na altura; enquanto os ventos
tumultuam nos plainos, sacudindo e retorcendo as galhadas.
Embruscado em minutos, o firmamento golpeia-se de relâmpagos precípites, sucessivos, sarjando fundamente a
imprimadura negra da tormenta. Reboam ruidosamente as trovoadas fortes. As bátegas de chuva tombam
grossas, espaçadamente, sobre o chão, adunando-se logo em aguaceiro diluviano...
Ressurreição da flora
E ao tornar da travessia o viajante, pasmo, não vê mais o deserto.
Sobre o solo, que as amarílis atapetam, ressurge triunfalmente a flora tropical.
É uma mutação de apoteose.
Os mulungus rotundos, à borda das cacimbas cheias, estafolhas; as caraíbas e baraúnas altas refrondescem à
margem dos ribeirões refertos; ramalham, ressoantes, os marizeiros esgalhados, à passagem das virações suaves;
assomam, vivazes, amortecendo as truncaduras das quebradas, as quixabeiras de folhas pequeninas e frutos que
lembram contas de ônix; mais virentes, adensam-se os icozeiros pelas várzeas, sob o ondular festivo das copas
dos ouricuris: ondeiam, móveis, avivando a paisagem, acamando-se nos plainos, arredondando as encostas, as
moitas floridas do alecrim-dos-tabuleiros, de caules finos e flexíveis; as umburanas perfumam os ares,
filtrando-os nas frondes enfolhadas, e — dominando a revivescência geral — não já pela altura senão pelo
gracioso do porte, os umbuzeiros alevantam dois metros sobre o chão, irradiantes em círculo, os galhos
numerosos.
O umbuzeiro
É a árvore sagrada do sertão. Sócia fiel das rápidas horas felizes e longos dias amargos dos vaqueiros.
Representa o mais frisante exemplo de adaptação da flora sertaneja. Foi, talvez, de talhe mais vigoroso e alto —
e veio descaindo, pouco a pouco, numa interdecadência de estios flamívomos e invernos torrenciais,
modificando-se à feição do meio, desinvoluindo, até se preparar para a resistência e reagindo, por fim,
desafiando as secas duradouras, sustentando-se nas quadras miseráveis mercê da energia vital que economiza nas
estações benéficas das reservas guardadas em grande cópia nas raízes.
E reparte-as com o homem. Se não existisse o umbuzeiro aquele trato de sertão, tão estéril que nele escasseiam
os carnaubais tão providencialmente dispersos nos que o convizinham até ao Ceará, estaria despovoado. O umbu
é para o infeliz matuto que ali vive o mesmo que a mauritia para os garaunos dos llanos.
Alimenta-o e mitiga-lhe a sede. Abre-lhe o seio acariciador e amigo, onde os ramos recurvos e entrelaçados
parecem de propósito feitos para a armação das redes bamboantes. E ao chegarem os tempos felizes dá-lhe os
frutos de sabor esquisito para o preparo da umbuzada tradicional.
O gado, mesmo nos dias de abastança, cobiça o sumo acidulado das suas folhas. Realça-se-lhe, então, o porte,
levantada, em recorte firme, a copa arredondada, num plano perfeito sobre o chão, à altura atingida pelos bois
mais altos, ao modo de plantas ornamentais entregues à solicitude de práticos jardineiros. Assim decotadas
semelham grandes calotas esféricas. Dominam a flora sertaneja nos tempos felizes, como os cereus melancólicos
nos paroxismos estivais.
A jurema
As juremas, prediletas dos caboclos — o seu haxixe capitoso, fornecendo-lhes, grátis, inestimável beberagem,
que os revigora depois das caminhadas longas, extinguindo-lhes as fadigas em momentos, feito um filtro mágico
— derramam-se em sebes, impenetráveis tranqueiras disfarçadas em folhas diminutas; refrondam os marizeiros
raros — misteriosas árvores que pressagiam a volta das chuvas e das épocas aneladas do ""verde” e o termo da
""magrém"" — quando, em pleno flagelar da seca, Ihes porejam na casca ressequida dos troncos algumas gotas
d'água; reverdecem os angicos; lourejam os juás em moitas, e as baraúnas de flores em cachos, e os araticuns à
ourela dos banhados... mas, destacando-se, esparsos pelas chapadas, ou no bolear dos cerros, os umbuzeiros,
estrelando flores alvíssimas, abrolhando em folhas, que passam em fugitivos cambiantes de um verde pálido ao
róseo vivo dos rebentos novos, atraem melhor o olhar, são a nota mais feliz do cenário deslumbrante.
O sertão é um paraíso
E o sertão é um paraíso...
Ressurge ao mesmo tempo a fauna resistente das caatingas: disparam pelas baixadas úmidas os caititus esquivos;
passam, em varas, pelas tigüeras num estrídulo estrepitar de maxilas percutindo, os queixadas de canela ruiva;
correm pelos tabuleiros altos, em bandos, esporeando-se com os ferrões de sob as asas, as emas velocíssimas; e
as seriemas de vozes lamentosas, e as sericóias vibrantes, cantam nos balsedos, à fimbria dos banhados onde
vem beber o tapir estacando um momento no seu trote, brutal, inflexivelmente retilíneo, pela caatinga,
derribando árvores; e as próprias suçuaranas, aterrando os mocós espertos que se aninham aos pares, nas luras
dos fraguedos, pulam, alegres, nas macegas altas, antes de quedarem nas tocaias traiçoeiras aos veados ariscos
ou novilhos desgarrados...
Manhãs sertanejas
Sucedem-se manhãs sem par, em que o irradiar do levante incendido retinge a púrpura das eritrinas e destaca
melhor, engrinaldando as umburanas de casca arroxeada, os festões multicores das bignônias. Animam-se os ares
numa palpitação de asas, céleres, ruflando. — Sulcam-nos as notas de clarins estranhos. Num tumultuar de
desencontrados vôos passam, em bandos, as pombas bravas que remigram, e rolam as turbas turbulentas das
maritacas estridentes... enquanto feliz, deslembrado de mágoas, segue o campeiro pelos arrastadores, tangendo a
boiada farta, e entoando a cantiga predileta...
Assim se vão os dias.
Passam-se um, dois, seis meses venturosos, derivados da exuberância da terra, até que surdamente,
imperceptivelmente, num ritmo maldito, se despeguem, a pouco e pouco, e caiam, as folhas e as flores, e a seca
se desenhe outra vez nas ramagens mortas das árvores decíduas....
Capítulo V
Uma categoria geográfica que Hegel não citou
Resumamos, enfeixemos estas linhas esparsas.
Hegel delineou três categorias geográficas como elementos fundamentais colaborando com outros no reagi:
sobre o homem, criando diferenciações étnicas:
As estepes de vegetação tolhiça, ou vastas planícies áridas; os vales férteis, profusamente irrigados; os
litorais e as ilhas.
Os llanos da Venezuela; as savanas que alargam o vale do Mississípi, os pampas desmedidos e o próprio
Atacama desatado sobre os Andes — vasto terraço onde vagueiam dunas — inscrevem-se rigorosamente nos
primeiros.
Em que pese aos estios longos, as trombas formidáveis de areia, e ao saltear de súbitas inundações, não se
incompatibilizam com a vida.
Mas não fixam o homem à terra.
A sua flora rudimentar, de gramíneas e ciperáceas, reviçando vigorosa nas quadras pluviosas, é um
incentivo à vida pastoril, às sociedades errantes dos pegureiros, passando móveis, num constante armar e
desarmar de tendas, por aqueles plainas — rápidas, dispersas aos primeiros fulgores do verão.
Não atraem. Patenteiam sempre o mesmo cenário de uma monotonia acabrunhadora, com a variante única
da cor: um oceano imóvel, sem vagas e sem praias.
Têm a força centrífuga do deserto: repelem; desunem; dispersam. Não se podem ligar a humanidade pelo
vinculo nupcial do sulco dos arados. São um isolador étnico como as cordilheiras e o mar, ou as estepes da
Mongólia, varejadas, em corridas doidas, pelas catervas turbulentas dos tártaros errabundos.
Aos sertões do Norte, porém, que à primeira vista se lhes equiparam, falta um lugar no quadro do pensador
germânico.
Ao atravessá-los no estio, crê-se que entram, de molde, naquela primeira subdivisão; ao atravessá-los no
inverno, acredita-se que são parte essencial da segunda.
Barbaramente estéreis; maravilhosamente exuberantes...
Na plenitude das secas são positivamente o deserto. Mas quando estas não se prolongam ao ponto de
originarem penosíssimos êxodos, o homem luta como as árvores, com as reservas armazenadas nos dias de
abastança e, neste combate feroz, anônimo, terrivelmente obscuro, afogado na solidão das chapadas, a natureza
não o abandona de todo. Ampara-o muito além das horas de desesperança, que acompanham o esgotamento das
últimas cacimbas.
Ao sobrevir das chuvas, a terra, como vimos, transfigura-se em mutações fantásticas, contrastando com a
desolação anterior. Os vales secos fazem-se rios. Insulam-se os cômoros escalvados, repentinamente verdejantes.
A vegetação recama de flores, cobrindo-os, os grotões escancelados, e disfarça a dureza das barrancas, e
arredonda em colinas os acervos de blocos disjungidos — de sorte que as chapadas grandes, intermeadas de
convales, se ligam em curvas mais suaves aos tabuleiros altos. Cai a temperatura. Com o desaparecer das
soalheiras anula-se a secura anormal dos ares. Novos tons na paisagem: a transparência do espaço salienta as
linhas mais ligeiras, em todas as variantes da forma e da cor.
Dilatam-se os horizontes. O firmamento sem o azul carregado dos desertos alteia-se, mais profundo, ante o
expandir revivescente da terra.
E o sertão é um vale fértil. É um pomar vastíssimo, sem dono.
Depois tudo isto se acaba. Voltam os dias torturantes; a atmosfera asfixiadora; o empedramento do solo; a
nudez da flora; e nas ocasiões em que os estios se ligam sem a intermitência das chuvas — o espasmo
assombrador da seca.
A natureza compraz-se em um jogo de antíteses.
Eles impõem por isto uma divisão especial naquele quadro. A mais interessante e expressiva de todas —
posta, como mediadora, entre os vales nimiamente férteis e as estepes mais áridas.
Relegando a outras páginas a sua significação como fator de diferenciação étnica, vejamos o seu papel na
economia da terra.
A natureza não cria normalmente os desertos. Combate-os, repulsa-os. Desdobram-se, lacunas
inexplicáveis, às vezes sob as linhas astronômicas definidoras da exuberância máxima da vida. Expressos no tipo
clássico do Saara — que é um termo genérico da região maninha dilatada do Atlântico ao Indico, entrando pelo
Egito e pela Síria, assumindo todos os aspectos da enorme depressão africana ao plateau arábico ardentíssimo de
Nedjed e avançando daí para as areias dos bejabans, na Pérsia — são tão ilógicos que o maior dos naturalistas
lobrigou a gênese daquele na ação tumultuaria de um cataclismo, uma irrupção do Atlântico, precipitando-se,
águas revoltas, num irresistível remoinhar de correntes, sobre o Norte da- África e desnudando-a furiosamente.
Esta explicação de Humboldt, embora se erija apenas como hipótese brilhante, tem um significado superior.
Extinta a preponderância do calor central e normalizados os climas, do extremo norte e do extremo sul, a
partir dos pólos inabitáveis, a existência vegetativa progride para a linha equinocial. Sob esta ficam as zonas
exuberantes por excelência, onde os arbustos de outras se fazem árvores e o regímen, oscilando em duas estações
únicas, determina uniformidade favorável à evolução dos organismos simples, presos diretamente às variações
do meio. A fatalidade astronômica da inclinação da eclética, que coloca a Terra em condições biológicas
inferiores às de outros planetas, mal se percebe nas paragens onde uma montanha única sintetiza, do sopé às
cumeadas, todos os climas do mundo.
Entretanto, por elas passa, interferindo a fronteira ideal dos hemisférios, o equador termal, de traçado
perturbadíssimo de inflexões vivas, partindo-se nos pontos singulares em que a vida é impossível; passando dos
desertos às florestas, do Saara, que o repuxa para o norte, à Índia opulentíssima, depois de tangenciar a ponta
meridional da Arábia paupérrima; varando o Pacífico num longo traço — rarefeito colar de ilhas desertas e
escalvadas — e abeirando, depois, em lento descambar para o sul, a Hilae portentosa do Amazonas.
Da extrema aridez à exuberância extrema...
É que a morfologia da terra viola as leis gerais dos clima. Mas todas as vezes que o facies geográfico não as
combate de todo a natureza reage. Em luta surda, cujos efeitos fogem ao próprio raio dos ciclos históricos, mas
emocionante, para quem consegue lobrigá-la ao, através de séculos sem conto, entorpecida sempre pelos agentes
adversos, mas tenaz, incoercível, num evolver seguro, a terra como um organismo, se transmuda por
intuscepção, indiferente aos elementos que lhe tumultuam à face.
De sorte que se as largas depressões eternamente condenadas, a exemplo da Austrália, permanecem estéreis
se anulam, noutros pontos, os desertos.
A própria temperatura abrasada acaba lhes dar um mínimo de pressão atraindo o afluxo das chuvas; e as
areias móveis, riscadas pelos ventos, negando largo tempo a pega à planta mais humilde, imobilizam-se, a pouco
e pouco, presas nas radículas das gramíneas; o chão ingrato e a rocha estéril decaem sob a ação imperceptível
dos líquens, que preparam a vinda das lecídeas frágeis; e por fim, os platôs desnudos, llanos e pampas de
vegetação escassa, as savanas e as estepes mais vivazes da Ásia Central, surgem, num crescendo, refletindo
sucessivas fases de transfigurações maravilhosas.
Como se faz um deserto
Ora, os sertões do Norte, a despeito de uma esterilidade menor, contrapostos a este critério natural, figuram
talvez o ponto singular de uma evolução regressiva.
Imaginamo-los há pouco, numa retrospecção em que, certo, a fantasia se insurgiu contra a gravidade da
ciência, a emergirem, geologicamente modernos, de um vasto mar terciário.
À parte essa hipótese absolutamente instável, porém, o certo é que um complexo de circunstâncias lhes tem
dificultado regímen contínuo, favorecendo flora mais vivaz.
Esboçamos anteriormente algumas.
Esquecemo-nos, todavia, de um agente geológico notável — o homem.
Este, de fato, não raro reage brutalmente sobre a terra e entre nós, nomeadamente, assumiu, em todo o
decorrer da história, o papel de um terrível fazedor de desertos.
Começou isto por um desastroso legado indígena.
Na agricultura primitiva dos silvícolas era instrumento fundamental — o fogo.
Entalhadas as árvores pelos cortantes dgis de diorito; encoivarados, depois de secos, os ramos,
alastravam-lhes por cima, crepitando, as caiçaras, em bulcão de fumo, tangidas pelos ventos. Inscreviam, depois,
nas cercas de troncos combustos das caiçaras, a área em cinzas onde fora a mata exuberante. Cultivavam-na.
Renovavam o mesmo processo na estação seguinte, até que, de todo exaurida, aquela mancha da terra fosse,
imprestável, abandonada em caapuera — mato extinto — como o denuncia a etimologia tupi, jazendo dali por
diante irremediavelmente estéril porque, por uma circunstância digna de nota, as famílias vegetais que surgiam
subsecutivamente no terreno calcinado eram sempre de tipos arbustivos enfezados, de todo distintos dos da selva
primitiva. O aborígine prosseguia abrindo novas roças, novas derrubadas, novas queimas, alargando o círculo
dos estragos em novas caapueras, que ainda uma vez deixava para formar outras noutros pontos, aparecendo
maninhas, num evolver enfezado, inaptas para reagir com os elementos exteriores, agravando, à medida que se
ampliavam, os rigores do próprio clima que as flagelava, e entretecidas de carrascais, afogadas em macegas,
espelhando aqui o aspecto adoentado da catanduva sinistra, além a braveza convulsiva da caatinga brancacenta.
Veio depois o colonizador e copiou o mesmo proceder. Engravesceu-o ainda com o adotar, exclusivo, no
centro do país, fora da estreita faixa dos canaviais da costa, o regímen francamente pastoril.
Abriram-se desde o alvorecer do século 17, nos sertões abusivamente sesmados, enormíssimos campos,
compáscuos sem divisas, estendendo-se pelas chapadas em fora.
Abria-os, de idêntico modo, o fogo livremente aceso, sem aceiros, avassalando largos espaços, solto nas
lufadas violentas do nordeste. Aliou-se-lhe ao mesmo tempo o sertanista ganancioso e bravo, em busca do
silvícola e do ouro. Afogado nos recessos de uma flora estupenda que lhe escurentava as vistas e sombreava
perigosamente as tocaias do tapuia e as tocas do canguçu temido, dilacerou-a golpeando-a de chamas, para
desafogar os horizontes e destacar bem perceptíveis, tufando nos descampados limpos, as montanhas que o
norteavam, balizando a marcha das bandeiras.
Atacou a fundo a terra, escarificando-a nas explorações a céu aberto; esterilizou-a com os lastros das
grupiaras; feriu-a a pontaços de alvião; degradou-a corroendo-a com as águas selvagens das torrentes; e deixou,
aqui, ali, em toda parte, para sempre estéreis, avermelhando nos ermos com o intenso colorido das argilas
revolvidas, onde não medra a planta mais exígua, as grandes catas, vazias e tristonhas, com a sua feição
sugestiva de imensas cidades mortas, derruídas...
Ora, estas selvatiquezas atravessaram toda a nossa história. Ainda em meados deste século, no atestar de
velhos habitantes das povoações ribeirinhas do S. Francisco, os exploradores que em 1830 avançaram, a partir da
margem esquerda daquele rio, carregando em vasilhas de couro indispensáveis provisões de água, tinham, na
frente, alumiando-lhes a rota, abrindo-lhes a estrada e devastando a terra, o mesmo batedor sinistro, o incêndio.
Durante meses seguidos viu-se no poente, entrando pelas noites dentro, o reflexo rubro das queimadas.
Imaginem-se os resultados de semelhante processo aplicado, sem variantes, no decorrer de séculos...
Previu-os o próprio governo colonial. Desde 1713 sucessivos decretos visaram opor-lhes paradeiros. E ao
terminar a seca lendária de 1791-1792, a ""grande seca"", como dizem ainda os velhos sertanejos, que sacrificou
todo o Norte, da Bahia ao Ceará, o governo da metrópole figura-se tê-la atribuído aos inconvenientes apontados,
estabelecendo desde logo, como corretivo único, severa proibição ao corte das florestas.
Esta preocupação dominou-o por muito tempo. Mostram-no-lo as cartas régias de 17 de março de 1796,
nomeando um juiz conservador das matas; e a de 11 de junho de 1799, decretando que “se coíba a indiscreta e
desordenada ambição dos habitantes ( da Bahia e Pernambuco ) que têm assolado a ferro e fogo preciosas
matas... que tanto abundavam e já hoje ficam a distancias consideráveis etc."".
Aí estão dizeres preciosos relativos diretamente à região que palidamente descrevemos.
Há outros, cômpares na eloqüência.
Deletreando-se antigos roteiros dos sertanistas do Norte, destemerosos caatingueiros que pleiteavam
parelhas com os bandeirantes do Sul, nota-se a cada passo uma alusão incisiva à bruteza das paragens que
atravessavam, perquirindo as chapadas, em busca das ""minas de prata"" de Melchior Moreia — e passando quase
todos à margem do sertão de Canudos, com escala em Monte Santo, então o Pico-araçá dos tapuias. E falam nos
""campos frios"" ( certamente à noite, pela irradiação intensa do solo desabrigado ) cortando léguas de caatinga
sem água nem caravatá que a tivesse e com raízes de umbu e mandacaru, remediando a gente"" no penoso
desbravar das veredas .
Já nessa época, como se vê, tinham função proverbial às plantas, para as quais, hoje, apelam os nossos
sertanejos.
É que o mal é antigo. Colaborando com os elementos meteorológicos, com o nordeste, com a sucção dos
estratos, com as canículas, com a erosão eólia, com as tempestades subitâneas — o homem fez-se uma
componente nefasta entre as forças daquele clima demolidor. Se o não criou, transmudou-o, agravando-o. Deu
um auxiliar à degradação das tormentas, o machado do caatingueiro; um supletivo à insolação, a queimada.
Fez, talvez, o deserto. Mas pode extingui-lo ainda, corrigindo o passado. E a tarefa não é insuperável. Di-lo
uma comparação histórica.
Como se extingue o deserto
Quem atravessa as planícies elevadas da Tunísia, entre Beja e Biserta, à ourela do Saara, encontra ainda, no
desembocar dos vales, atravessando normalmente o curso caprichoso e em torcicolos dos oueds, restos de antigas
construções romanas. Velhos muradais derruídos, embrechados de silhares e blocos rolados, cobertos em parte
pelos detritos de enxurros de vinte séculos, aqueles legados dos grandes colonizadores delatam a um tempo a sua
atividade inteligente e o desleixo bárbaro dos árabes que os substituíram.
Os romanos depois da tarefa da destruição de Cartago tinham posto ombros à empresa incomparavelmente
mais séria de vencer a natureza antagonista. E ali deixaram belíssimo traço de sua expansão histórica.
Perceberam com segurança o vício original da região, estéril menos pela escassez das chuvas do que pela
sua péssima distribuição adstrita aos relevos topográficos. Corrigiram-no. O regímen torrencial que ali aparece,
intensíssimo em certas quadras, determinando alturas pluviométricas maiores que as de outros países férteis e
exuberantes, era, como nos sertões do nosso país, além de inútil, nefasto. Caía sobre a terra desabrigada,
desarraigando a vegetação mal presa a um solo endurecido; turbilhonava por algumas semanas nos regatos
transbordantes, alagando as planícies; e desaparecia logo, derivando em escarpamentos, pelo norte e pelo
levante, no Mediterrâneo, deixando o solo, depois de uma revivescência transitória, mais desnudo e estéril. O
deserto, ao sul, parecia avançar, dominando a paragem toda, vingando-lhe os últimos acidentes que não tolhiam
a propulsão do simum.
Os romanos fizeram-no recuar. Encadearam as torrentes; represaram as correntezas fortes, e aquele regímen
brutal, tenazmente combatido e bloqueado, cedeu, submetido inteiramente, numa rede de barragens. Excluído o
alvitre de irrigações sistemáticas dificílimas, conseguiram que as águas permanecessem mais longo tempo sobre
a terra. As ravinas recortando-se em gânglios estagnados dividiram-se açudes abarreirados pelas muralhas que
trancavam os vales, e os oueds, parando, intumesciam-se entre os morros, conservando largo tempo as grandes
massas líquidas, até então perdidas, ou levando-as, no transbordarem, em canais laterais aos lugares próximos
mais baixos, onde se abriam em sangradouros e levadas, irradiantes por toda a parte, e embebendo o solo. De
sorte que este sistema de represas, além de outras vantagens, criara um esforço de irrigação geral. Ademais,
todas aquelas superfícies líquidas esparsas em grande número e não resumidas a um Quixadá único —
monumental e inútil — expostas à evaporação, acabaram reagindo sobre o clima, melhorando-o. Por fim a
Tunísia, onde haviam aproado os filhos prediletos dos fenícios, mas que até então se reduzira a um litoral
povoado de traficantes ou númidas erradios, com suas tendas de tetos curvos branqueando nos ares como quilhas
encalhadas — se fez, transfigurada, a terra clássica da agricultura antiga. Foi o celeiro da Itália; a fornecedora
quase exclusiva, de trigo, dos romanos.
Os franceses, hoje, copiam-lhes em grande parte os processos, sem necessitarem alevantar muramentos
monumentais e dispendiosos. Represam por estacadas, entre muros de pedras secas e terras, à maneira de
palancas, os oueds mais bem dispostos, e talham pelo alto das suas bordas, em toda à largura das serranias que os
ladeiam, condutos derivando para os terrenos circunjacentes, em redes irrigadoras.
Deste modo as águas selvagens estacam, remansam-se, sem adquirir a força acumulada das inundações
violentas, disseminando-se, afinal, estas, amortecidas, em milhares de válvulas, pelas derivações cruzadas. E a
histórica paragem, liberta da apatia do moslim inerte, transmuda-se volvendo de novo à fisionomia antiga. A
França salva os restos da opulenta herança da civilização romana, depois desse declínio de séculos.
*
Ora, quando se traçar, sem grande precisão embora, a carta hipsométrica dos sertões do Norte, ver-se-á que
eles se apropriam a uma tentativa idêntica, de resultados igualmente seguros.
A. idéia não é nova. Sugeriu-a há muito, em memoráveis sessões do Instituto Politécnico do Rio, em 1877,
o belo espírito do conselheiro Beaurepaire Rohan, talvez sugestionado pelo mesmo símile, que acima apontamos.
Das discussões então travadas onde se enterreiraram os melhores cientistas do tempo — da sólida
experiência de Capanema à mentalidade rara de André Rebouças — foi a única coisa prática, factível,
verdadeiramente útil que ficou.
Idearam-se, naquela ocasião, luxuosas cisternas de alvenarias; miríades de poços artesianos, perfurando as
chapadas; depósitos colossais ou armazéns desmedidos para as reservas acumuladas; açudes vastos, feitos
cáspios artificiais; e por fim, como para caracterizar bem o desbarate completo da engenharia, ante a enormidade
do problema, estupendos alambiques para a destilação das águas do Atlântico!…
O alvitre mais modesto porém, efeito imediato de um ensinamento histórico, sugerido pelo mais elementar
dos exemplos, suplanta-os. Porque é, além de prático, evidentemente o mais lógico.
O martírio secular da terra
Realmente, entre os agentes determinantes da seca se intercalam, de modo apreciável, a estrutura e a
conformação do solo. Qualquer que seja a intensidade das causas complexas e mais remotas que anteriormente
esboçamos, a influência daquelas é manifesta desde que se considere que a capacidade absorvente e emissiva dos
terrenos expostos, a inclinação dos estratos, que os retalham, e a rudeza dos relevos topográficos, agravam, do
mesmo passo, a crestadura dos estios e a degradação intensiva das torrentes. De sorte que, saindo das insolações
demoradas para as inundações subitâneas, a terra, mal protegida por uma vegetação decídua, que as primeiras
requeimam e as segundas erradicam, se deixa, a pouco e pouco, invadir pelo regímen francamente desértico.
As fortes tempestades que apagam o incêndio surdo das secas, em que pese à revivescência que acarretam,
preparam de algum modo a região para maiores vicissitudes. Desnudam-na rudemente, expondo-a cada vez mais
desabrigada aos verões seguintes; sulcam-na numa molduragem de contornos ásperos; golpeiam-na e
esterilizam-na; e, ao desaparecerem, deixam-na ainda mais desnuda ante a adustão dos sóis. O regímen decorre
num intermitir deplorável, que lembra um círculo vicioso de catástrofes.
Deste modo a medida única a adotar-se deve consistir no corretivo destas disposições naturais. Pondo de
lado os fatores determinantes do flagelo, oriundos da fatalidade de leis astronômicas ou geográficas inacessíveis
à intervenção humana, são, aquelas, as únicas possíveis de modificações apreciáveis.
O processo que indicamos, em breve recordação histórica, pela sua própria simplicidade dispensa inúteis
pormenores técnicos.
A França copia-o hoje, sem variantes, revivendo o traçado de construções velhíssimas.
Abarreirados os vales, inteligentemente escolhidos, em pontos pouco intervalados, por toda a extensão do
território sertanejo, três conseqüências inevitáveis decorreriam: atenuar-se-iam de modo considerável a
drenagem violenta do solo e as suas conseqüências lastimáveis; formar-se-lhes-iam à ourela, inscritas na rede das
derivações, fecundas áreas de cultura; e fixar-se-ia uma situação de equilíbrio para a instabilidade do clima,
porque os numerosos e pequenos açudes, uniformemente distribuídos e constituindo dilatada superfície de
evaporação, teriam, naturalmente, no correr dos tempos, a influência moderadora de um mar interior, de
importância extrema.
Não há alvitrar-se outro recurso. As cisternas, poços artesianos e raros, ou longamente espaçados lagos
como o de Quixadá, têm um valor local, inapreciável. Visam, de um modo geral, atenuar a última das
conseqüências da seca — a sede; e o que há a combater e a debelar nos sertões do Norte — é o deserto.
O martírio do homem, ali, é reflexo de tortura maior, mais ampla, abrangendo a economia geral da Vida.
Nasce do martírio secular da terra…

Capítulo I
Complexidade do problema etnológico no Brasil
Adstrita às influências que mutuam, em graus variáveis, três elementos étnicos, a gênese das raças mestiças
do Brasil é um problema que por muito tempo ainda desafiará o esforço dos melhores espíritos.
Está apenas delineado.
Entretanto no domínio das investigações antropológicas brasileiras se encontram nomes altamente
encarecedores do nosso movimento intelectual. Os estudos sobre a pré-história indígena patenteiam modelos de
obervação sutil e conceito critico brilhante, mercê dos quais parece definitivamente firmado, contravindo ao
pensar dos caprichosos construtores da ponte alêutica, o autoctonismo das raças americanas.
Neste belo esforço, rematado pela profunda elaboração paleontológica de Wilhelm Lund, destacam-se o
nome de Morton, a intuição genial de Frederico Hartt, a inteiriça organização cientifica de Meyer, a rara lucidez
de Trajano de Moura, e muitos outros cujos trabalhos reforçam os de Nott e Gordon no definir, de uma maneira
geral mas completa, a América como um centro de criação desligado do grande viveiro da Ásia Central. Erige-se
autônomo entre as raças o homo americanus.
A face primordial da questão ficou assim aclarada. Que resultem do ""homem da Lagoa Santa"" cruzado com
o pré-colombiano dos sambaquis; ou se derivem, altamente modificados por ulteriores cruzamentos e pelo meio,
de alguma raça invasora do Norte, de que se supõe oriundos os tupis tão numerosos na época do descobrimento
— os nossos silvícolas, com seus frisantes caracteres antropológicos, podem ser considerados tipos evanescentes
de velhas raças autóctones da nossa terra.
Esclarecida deste modo a preliminar da origem do elemento indígena, as investigações convergiram para a
definição da sua psicologia especial; e enfeixaram-se, ainda, em algumas conclusões seguras.
Não precisamos revivê-las. Sobre faltar-nos competência. nos desviaríamos muito de um objetivo
prefixado.
Os dois outros elementos formadores, alienígenas, não originaram idênticas tentativas. O negro banto, ou
catre, com as suas várias modalidades, foi até neste ponto o nosso eterno desprotegido. Somente nos últimos
tempos um investigador tenaz, Nina Rodrigues, subordinou a uma análise cuidadosa a sua religiosidade original
e interessante. Qualquer, porém, que tenha sido o ramo africano para aqui transplantado trouxe, certo, os
atributos preponderantes do homo afer, filho das paragens adustas e bárbaras, onde a seleção natural, mais que
em quaisquer outras, se faz pelo exercício intensivo da ferocidade e da força.
Quanto ao fator aristocrático de nossa gens, o português, que nos liga à vibrátil estrutura intelectual do
celta, está, por sua vez, malgrado o complicado caldeamento de onde emerge, de todo caracterizado.
Conhecemos, deste modo, os três elementos essenciais, e, imperfeitamente embora, o meio físico
diferenciados — e ainda, sob todas as suas formas; as condições históricas adversas ou favoráveis que sobre eles
reagiram. No considerar, porém, todas as alternativas e todas as fases intermédias desse entrelaçamento de tipos
antropológicos de graus díspares nos atributos físicos e psíquicos, sob os influxos de um meio variável, capaz de
diversos climas, tendo discordantes aspectos e apostas condições de vida, pode afirmar-se que pouco nos temos
avantajado. Escrevemos todas as variáveis de uma fórmula intricada, traduzindo sério problema; mas não
desvendamos todas as incógnitas.
É que, evidentemente, não basta, para o nosso caso, que postos uns diante de outros o negro banto, o
indo-guarani e o branco, apliquemos ao conjunto a lei antropológica de Broca. Esta é abstrata e irredutível. Não
nos diz quais os reagentes que podem atenuar o influxo da raça mais numerosa ou mais forte, e causas que o
extingam ou atenuem quando ao contrário da combinação binária, que pressupõe, despontam três fatores
diversos, adstritos às vicissitudes da história e dos climas.
É uma regra que nos orienta apenas no indagarmos a verdade. Modifica-se, como todas as leis, à pressão
dos dados objetivos. Mas ainda quando por extravagante indisciplina mental alguém tentasse aplicá-la, de todo
despeada da intervenção daqueles, não simplificaria o problema.
É fácil demonstrar.
Abstraiamos de inúmeras causas perturbadoras, e consideremos os três elementos constituintes de nossa
raça em si mesmos, intactas as capacidades que Ihes são próprias.
Vemos, de pronto, que. mesmo nesta hipótese favorável, deles não resulta o produto único imanente às
combinações binárias, numa fusão imediata em que se justaponham ou se resumam os seus caracteres, unificados
e convergentes num tipo intermediário. Ao contrário a combinação ternária inevitável determina, no caso mais
simples, três outras, binárias. Os elementos iniciais não se resumem, não se unificam; desdobram-se; originam
número igual de subformações — substituindo-se pelos derivados, sem redução alguma, em uma mestiçagem
embaralhada onde se destacam como produtos mais característicos o mulato, o mamaluco ou curiboca e o cafuz .
As sedes iniciais das indagações deslocam-se apenas mais perturbadas, graças a reações que não exprimem uma
redução, mas um desdobramento. E o estudo destas subcategorias substitui o das raças elementares agravando-o
e dificultando-o, desde que se considere que aquelas comportam, por sua vez, inúmeras modalidades consoante
as dosagens variáveis do sangue.
O brasileiro, tipo abstrato que se procura, mesmo no caso favorável acima firmado, só pode surdir de um
entrelaçamento consideravelmente complexo.
Teoricamente ele seria o pardo, para que convergem os cruzamentos do mulato, do curiboca e do cafuz.
Avaliando-se, porém, as condições históricas que têm atuado, diferentes nos diferentes tratos do território;
as disparidades climáticas que nestes ocasionam reações diversas diversamente suportadas pelas raças
constituintes; a maior ou menor densidade com que estas cruzaram nos vários pontos do país; e atendendo-se
ainda à intrusão — pelas armas na quadra colonial e pelas imigrações em nossos dias — de outros povos, fato
que por sua vez não foi e não é uniforme, vê-se bem que a realidade daquela formação é altamente duvidosa,
senão absurda.
Como quer que seja, estas rápidas considerações explicam as disparidades de vistas que reinam entre os
nossos antropólogos. Forrando-se, em geral, à tarefa penosa de subordinar as suas pesquisas a condições tão
complexas, têm atendido sobremaneira ao preponderar das capacidades étnicas. Ora, a despeito da grave
influência destas, e não a negamos, elas foram entre nós levadas ao exagero, determinando a irrupção de uma
meia-ciência difundida num extravagar de fantasias, sobre ousadas, estéreis. Há como que um excesso de
subjetivismo no animo dos que entre nós, nos últimos tempos, cogitam de coisas tão sérias com uma
volubilidade algo escandalosa, atentas as proporções do assunto. Começam excluindo em grande parte os
materiais objetivos oferecidos pelas circunstâncias mesológica e histórica. Jogam, depois, e entrelaçam, e
fundem as três raças consoante os caprichos que os impelem no momento. E fazem repontar desta metaquímica
sonhadora alguns precipitados fictícios.
Alguns firmando preliminarmente, com autoridade discutível, a função secundária do meio físico e
decretando preparatoriamente a extinção quase completa do silvícola e a influência decrescente do africano
depois da abolição do tráfico, prevêem a vitória final do branco, mais numeroso e mais forte, como termo geral
de uma série para o qual tendem o mulato, forma cada vez mais diluída do negro, e o caboclo, em que se
apagam, mais depressa ainda, os traços característicos do aborígine.
Outros dão maiores largas aos devaneios. Ampliam a influência do último. E arquitetam fantasias que caem ao
mais breve choque da crítica: devaneios a que nem faltam a metrificação e as rimas porque invadem a ciência na
vibração rítmica dos versos de Gonçalves Dias.
Outros vão terra a terra de mais. Exageram a influência do africano, capaz, com efeito, de reagir em muitos
pontos contra a absorção da raça superior. Surge o mulato. Proclamam-no o mais característico tipo da nossa
subcategoria étnica.
O assunto assim vai derivando multiforme e dúbio.
Acreditamos que isto sucede porque o escopo essencial destas investigações se tem reduzido à pesquisa de
um tipo étnico único, quando há, certo, muitos.
Não temos unidade de raça.
Não a teremos, talvez, nunca.
Predestinamo-nos à formação de uma raça histórica em futuro remoto, se o permitir dilatado tempo de vida
nacional autônoma. Invertemos, sob este aspecto, a ordem natural dos fatos. A nossa evolução biológica reclama
a garantia da evolução social.
Estamos condenados à civilização.
Ou progredimos, ou desaparecemos.
A afirmativa é segura.
Não a sugere apenas essa heterogeneidade de elementos ancestrais. Reforça-a outro elemento igualmente
ponderável: um meio físico amplíssimo e variável, completado pelo variar de situações históricas, que dele em
grande parte decorreram.
A este propósito não será desnecessário considerá-lo por alguns momentos.
Variabilidade do meio físico
Contravindo à opinião dos que demarcam aos países quentes um desenvolvimento de 30° de latitude, o
Brasil está longe de se incluir todo em tal categoria. Sob um duplo aspecto, astronômico e geográfico, aquele
limite é exagerado.
Além de ultrapassar a demarcação teórica vulgar, exclui os relevos naturais que atenuam ou reforçam os agentes
meteorológicos, criando climas equatoriais em altas latitudes ou regímens temperados entre os trópicos. Toda a
climatologia, inscrita nos amplos lineamentos das leis cosmológicas gerais, desponta em qualquer parte adicta de
preferência às causas naturais mais próximas e particulares. Um clima é como que a tradução fisiológica de uma
condição geográfica. E definindo-o deste modo concluímos que o nosso país, pela sua própria estrutura, se
imprópria a um regímen uniforme.
Demonstram-no os resultados mais recentes, e são os únicos dignos de fé, das indagações meteorológicas.
Estas o subdividem em três zonas claramente distintas: a francamente tropical, que se expande pelos Estados do
Norte ao sul da Bahia, com uma temperatura média de 26°; a temperada, de S. Paulo ao Rio Grande, pelo Paraná
e Santa Catarina, entre os isotermos 15° e 20°; e como transição — a subtropical, alongando-se pelo Centro e
Norte de alguns Estados, de Minas ao Paraná.
Aí estão. claras, as divisas de três habitats distintos.
Ora, mesmo entre as linhas mais ou menos seguras destes despontam modalidades, que ainda os
diversificam.
Indiquemo-las a traços rápidos.
A disposição orográfica brasileira, possantes massas sublevadas que se orientam perlongando o litoral
perpendicularmente ao rumo do SE, determina as primeiras distinções em largos tratos de território que
demoram ao Oriente, criando anomalia climatológica expressiva.
De fato, o clima aí inteiramente subordinado aos facies geográficos viola as leis gerais que o regulam. A
partir dos trópicos para o Equador a sua caracterização astronômica, pelas latitudes, cede às causas secundárias
perturbadoras. Define-se, anormalmente, pelas longitudes.
É um fato conhecido. Na extensa faixa da costa, que vai da Bahia à Paraíba, se vêem transições mais
acentuadas, acompanhando os paralelos, no rumo do ocidente, do que os meridianos, demandando o norte. As
diferenças no regímen e nos aspectos naturais, que segundo este rumo são imperceptíveis, patenteiam-se, claras,
no primeiro. Distendida até às paragens setentrionais extremas, a mesma natureza exuberante ostenta-se
sem variantes nas grandes matas que debruam a costa, fazendo que a observação rápida do estrangeiro prefigure
dilatada região vivaz e feracíssima. Entretanto a partir do 13° paralelo as florestas mascaram vastos territórios
estéreis, retratando nas áreas desnudas as inclemências de um clima em que os graus termométricos e
higrométricos progridem em relação inversa, extremando-se exageradamente.
Revela-o curta viagem para o ocidente, a partir de um ponto qualquer daquela costa. Quebra-se o encanto de
ilusão belíssima. A natureza empobrece-se; despe-se das grandes matas; abdica o fastígio das montanhas;
erma-se e deprime-se — transmudando-se nos sertões exsicados e bárbaros, onde correm rios efêmeros, e
destacam-se em chapadas nuas, sucedendo-se, indefinidas, formando o palco desmedido para os quadros
dolorosos das secas.
O contraste é empolgante.
Distantes menos de cinqüenta léguas, apresentam-se regiões de todo opostas, criando opostas condições à
vida.
Entra-se, de surpresa, no deserto.
E, certo, as vagas humanas que nos dois primeiros séculos do povoamento embateram as plagas do Norte
tiveram na translação para o ocidente, demandando o interior, obstáculos mais sérios que a rota agitada dos
mares e das montanhas, na travessia das caatingas ralas e decíduas. O malogro da expansão baiana, que
entretanto precedera à paulista no devassar os recessos do país, é exemplo frisante.
O mesmo não sucede, porém, dos trópicos para o sul.
Aí a urdidura geológica da terra, matriz de sua morfogenia interessante, persiste inalterável, abrangendo
extensas superfícies para o interior, criando as mesmas condições favoráveis, a mesma flora, um clima altamente
melhorado pela altitude, e a mesma feição animadora dos aspectos naturais.
A larga antemural da cordilheira granítica, derivando a prumo para o mar, nas vertentes interiores descamba
suavemente em vastos plainos ondulados.
É a escarpa abrupta e viva dos planaltos.
Sobre estes os cenários, sem os traços exageradamente dominadores das montanhas, revelam-se mais opulentos e
amplos. A terra patenteia essa manageability of nature, de que nos fala Buckle, e o clima temperado quente
desafia na benignidade o admirável regímen da Europa Meridional. Não o regula mais, como mais para o norte,
exclusivamente, o SE. Rolando dos altos chapadões do interior, o NO prepondera então, em toda extensíssima
zona que vai das terras elevadas de Minas e do Rio ao Paraná, passando por S. Paulo.
Ora, estas largas divisões, apenas esboçadas, mostram já uma diferença essencial entre o Sul e o Norte,
absolutamente distintos pelo regímen meteorológico, pela disposição da terra e pela transição variável entre o
sertão e a costa.
Descendo à análise mais íntima desvendaremos aspectos particulares mais incisivos ainda.
Tomemos os casos mais expressivos, evitando extensa explanação do assunto.
Vimos em páginas anteriores que o SE, sendo o regulador predominante do clima na costa oriental, é
substituído, nos Estados do Sul, pelo NO e nas extremas setentrionais pelo NE. Ora, estes, por sua vez,
desaparecem no âmago dos planaltos, ante o SO que, como um hausto possante dos pampeiros, se lança pelo
Mato Grosso, originando desproporcionadas amplitudes termométricas, agravando a instabilidade do clima
continental, e submetendo as terras centrais a um regímen brutal, diverso dos que vimos rapidamente delineando.
Com efeito, a natureza em Mato Grosso balanceia os exageros de Buckle. É excepcional e nitidamente
destacada. Nenhuma se lhe assemelha. Toda a imponência selvagem, toda a exuberância inconceptível, unidas à
brutalidade máxima dos elementos, que o preeminente pensador, em precipitada generalização, ideou no Brasil,
ali estão francas, rompentes em cenários portentosos. Contemplando-as, mesmo através da frieza das
observações de naturalistas pouco vezados a efeitos descritivos, vê-se que aquele regímen climatológico
anômalo é o mais fundo traço da nossa variabilidade mesológica.
Nenhum se lhe equipara no jogar das antíteses. A sua feição aparente é a de benignidade extrema: — a terra
afeiçoada à vida; a natureza fecunda erguida na apoteose triunfal dos dias deslumbrantes e calmos; e o solo
abrolhando em vegetação fantástica — farto, irrigado de rios que irradiam pelos quatro pontos cardeais. Mas esta
placidez opulenta esconde, paradoxalmente, germens de cataclismos, que irrompendo, sempre com um ritmo
inquebrável, no estio, traindo-se nos mesmos prenúncios infalíveis, ali tombam com a finalidade irresistível de
uma lei.
Mal poderemos traçá-los. Esbocemo-los.
Depois de soprarem por alguns dias as rajadas quentes e úmidas de NE, os ares imobilizam-se, por algum
tempo, estagnados. Então ""a natureza como que se abate extática, assustada; nem as grimpas das árvores
balouçam; as matas, numa quietude medonha, parecem sólidos inteiriços. As aves se achegam nos ninhos,
suspendendo os vôos e se escondem"" .
Mas, volvendo-se o olhar para os céus, nem uma nuvem! O firmamento límpido arqueia-se alumiado ainda
por um Sol obscurecido, de eclipse. A pressão, entretanto, decai vagarosamente, numa descensão contínua,
afogando a vida. Por momentos um cumulus compacto, de bordas acobreado-escuras, negreja no horizonte, ao
sul. Deste ponto sopra, logo depois, uma viração, cuja velocidade cresce rápida, em ventanias fortes. A
temperatura cai em minutos e, minutos depois, os tufões sacodem violentamente a terra. Fulguram relâmpagos;
estrugem trovoadas nos céus já de todo bruscos e um aguaceiro torrencial desce logo sobre aquelas vastas
superfícies, apagando, numa inundação única, o divortium aquarum indeciso que as atravessa, adunando todas as
nascentes dos rios e embaralhando-lhes os leitos em alagados indefinidos...
É um assalto subitâneo. O cataclismo irrompe arrebatadamente na espiral vibrante de um ciclone.
Descolmam-se as casas; dobram-se, rangendo, e partem-se, estalando, os carandás seculares; ilham-se os morros;
alagoam-se os plainos...
E uma hora depois o Sol irradia triunfalmente no céu puríssimo! A passarada irrequieta descanta pelas
frondes gotejantes; suavizam os ares virações suaves — e o homem, deixando os refúgios a que se acolhera
trêmulo, contempla os estragos entre a revivescência universal da vida. Os troncos e galhos das árvores rachadas
pelos raios, estorcidas pelos ventos; as choupanas estruídas, colmos por terra; as últimas ondas barrentas dos
ribeirões, transbordantes; a erva acamada pelos campos, como se sobre eles passassem búfalos em tropel — mal
relembram a investida fulminante do flagelo...
Dias depois, os ventos rodam outra vez, vagarosamente, para leste; e a temperatura começa a subir de novo;
a pressão a pouco e pouco diminui; e cresce continuamente o mal-estar, até que se reate nos ares imobilizados a
componente formidável do pampeiro e ressurja, estrugidora, a tormenta, em rodeos turbilhonantes, enquadrada
pelo mesmo cenário lúgubre, revivendo o mesmo ciclo, o mesmo círculo vicioso de catástrofe.
Ora — avançando para o norte—desponta, contrastando com tais manifestações, o clima do Pará. Os
brasileiros de outras latitudes mal o compreendem, mesmo através das lúcidas observações de Bates.
Madrugadas tépidas, de 23° centígrados, sucedendo-se inesperadamente a noites chuvosas; dias que irrompem
como apoteoses fulgurantes, revelando transmutações inopinadas: árvores, na véspera despidas, aparecendo
juncadas de flores; brejos apaulados transmudando-se em prados. E logo depois, no círculo estreitíssimo de 24
horas, mutações completas: florestas silenciosas, galhos mal vestidos pelas folhas requeimadas ou murchas; ares
vazios e mudos; ramos viúvos das flores recém-abertas, cujas pétalas exsicadas se despegam e caem, mortas,
sobre a terra imóvel sob o espasmo enervante de um bochorno de 35°, à sombra. ""Na manhã seguinte, o Sol se
alevanta sem nuvens e deste modo se completa o ciclo — primavera, verão e outono num só dia tropical"" .
A constância de tal clima faz que se não percebam as estações que, entretanto, como em um índice
abreviado, se delineiam nas horas sucessivas de um só dia, sem que a temperatura quotidiana tenha durante todo
o ano uma oscilação maior que 1° ou 1°,5. Assim a vida se equilibra numa constância imperturbável.
Entretanto, a um lado, para o ocidente, no Alto Amazonas manifestações diversas caracterizam novo
habitat. E este, não há negá-lo, impõe aclimação penosa a todos os filhos dos próprios territórios limítrofes.
Ali, no pleno dos estios quentes, quando se diluem, mortas nos ares parados, as últimas lufadas de leste, o
termômetro é substituído pelo higrômetro na definição do clima. As existências derivam numa alternativa
dolorosa de vazantes e enchentes dos grandes rios. Estas alteiam-se sempre de um modo assombrador. O
Amazonas referto salta fora do leito, levanta em poucos dias o nível das águas, de dezessete metros; expande-se
em alagados vastos, em furos, em paranamirins ,entrecruzados em rede complicadíssima de mediterrâneo
cindido de correntes fortes, dentre as quais emergem, ilhados, os igapós verdejantes.
A enchente é unia parada na vida. Preso nas malhas dos igarapés, o homem aguarda, então, com estoicismo
raro ante a fatalidade incoercível, o termo daquele inverno paradoxal, de temperaturas altas. A vazante é o verão.
É a revivescência da atividade rudimentar dos que ali se agitam, do único modo compatível com uma natureza
que se demasia em manifestações dispares tornando impossível a continuidade de quaisquer esforços.
Tal regímen acarreta o parasitismo franco. O homem bebe o leite da vida sugando os vasos túmidos das
sifônias...
Mas neste clima singular e típico destacam-se outras anomalias, que ainda mais o agravam. Não bastam as
intermitências de cheias e estiagens, sobrevindo rítmicas como a sístole e a diástole da maior artéria na terra.
Outros fatos tornam ao forasteiro inúteis todas as tentativas de aclimação real.
Muitas vezes em plena enchente, em abril ou maio, no correr de um dia calmoso e claro, dentro da
atmosfera ardente do Amazonas difundem-se rajadas frigidíssimas do sul.
É como uma bafagem enregelada do pólo...
O termômetro desce, então, logo, numa queda única e forte, de improviso. Estabelece-se por alguns dias
uma situação inaturável.
Os ""regatões"" espertos que esporeados pela ganância se avantajam até ali, e os próprios silvícolas enrijados pela
adaptação, acolhem-se aos tejupás, tiritantes, abeirando-se das fogueiras. Cessam os trabalhos. Abre-se um novo
hiato nas atividades. Despovoam-se aquelas grandes solidões alagadas, morrem os peixes nos rios, enregelados;
morrem as aves nas matas silenciosas, ou emigram; esvaziam-se os ninhos; as próprias feras desaparecem,
encafurnadas nas tocas mais profundas — ; e aquela natureza maravilhosa do Equador, toda remodelada pela
reação esplêndida dos sois, patenteia um simulacro crudelíssimo de desolamento polar e lúgubre. É o tempo da
""friagem"".
Terminemos, porém, esses debuxos rápidos.
Os sertões do Norte, vimo-lo anteriormente, refletem, por sua vez, novos regímens, novas exigências
biológicas. Ali a mesma intercadência de quadras remansadas e dolorosas se espelha mais duramente talvez, sob
outras formas.
Ora, se considerarmos que estes vários aspectos climáticos não exprimem casos excepcionais, mas
aparecem todos, desde as tormentas do Mato Grosso aos ciclos das secas do Norte, com a feição periódica
imanente às leis naturais invioláveis, conviremos em que há no nosso meio físico variabilidade completa.
Daí os erros em que incidem os que generalizam, estudando a nossa fisiologia própria, a ação exclusiva de
um clima tropical. Esta exercita-se, sem dúvida, originando patologia sui generis, em quase toda a faixa
marítima do Norte e em grande parte dos Estados que lhe correspondem, até ao Mato Grosso. O calor úmido das
paragens amazonenses, por ex., deprime e exaure. Modela organizações tolhiças em que toda a atividade cede ao
permanente desequilíbrio entre as energias impulsivas das funções periféricas fortemente excitadas e a apatia das
funções centrais: inteligências marasmáticas, adormidas sob o explodir das paixões; enervações periclitantes, em
que pese à acuidade dos sentidos, e mal reparadas ou refeitas pelo sangue empobrecido nas hematoses
incompletas...
Daí todas as idiossincrasias de uma fisiologia excepcional: o pulmão que se reduz, pela deficiência da
função e é substituído, na eliminação obrigatória do carbono, pelo fígado, sobre o qual desce pesadamente a
sobrecarga da vida: organizações combalidas pela alternativa persistente de exaltações impulsivas e apatias
enervadoras, sem a vibratilidade, sem o tonus muscular enérgico dos temperamentos robustos e sangüíneos. A
seleção natural, em tal meio, opera-se à custa de compromissos graves com as funções centrais, do cérebro,
numa progressão inversa prejudicialíssima entre o desenvolvimento intelectual e o físico, firmando
inexoravelmente a vitória das expansões instintivas e visando o ideal de uma adaptação que tem, como
conseqüências únicas, a máxima energia orgânica, a mínima fortaleza moral. A aclimação traduz uma evolução
regressiva. O tipo deperece num esvaecimento contínuo, que se lhe transmite à descendência até a extinção total.
Como o inglês nas Barbadas, na Tasmânia ou na Austrália, o português no Amazonas, se foge ao cruzamento, no
fim de poucas gerações tem alterados os caracteres físicos e morais de uma maneira profunda, desde a tez, que se
acobreia pelos sóis e pela eliminação incompleta do carbono, ao temperamento, que se debilita despido das
qualidades primitivas. A raça inferior, o selvagem bronco, domina-o; aliado ao meio vence-o, esmaga-o, anula-o
na concorrência formidável ao impaludismo, ao hepatismo, às pirexias esgotantes, às canículas abrasadoras, e
aos alagadiços maleitosos.
Isto não acontece em grande parte do Brasil Central e em todos os lugares do Sul.
Mesmo na maior parte dos sertões setentrionais o calor seco, altamente corrigido pelos fortes movimentos
aéreos provindos dos quadrantes de leste, origina disposições mais animadoras e tem ação estimulante mais
benéfica.
E volvendo ao sul, no território que do norte de Minas para o sudoeste progride até o Rio Grande,
deparam-se condições incomparavelmente superiores:
Uma temperatura anual média de 17° a 20°, num jogo mais harmônico de estações; um regímen mais fixo
das chuvas que, preponderantes no verão, se distribuem no outono e na primavera de modo favorável às culturas.
Atingindo o inverno, a impressão de um clima europeu é precisa: sopra o SO frigidíssimo sacudindo
chuvisqueiros finos e esgarçando garoas; a neve rendilha as vidraças; gelam os banhados, e as geadas
branqueiam pelos campos...
... e sua reflexão na
História
A nossa história traduz notavelmente estas modalidades mesológicas.
Considerando-a sob uma feição geral, fora da ação perturbadora dos pormenores inexpressivos, vemos, logo
na fase colonial, esboçarem-se situações diversas.
Enfeudado o território, dividido pelos donatários felizes, e iniciando-se o povoamento do país com idênticos
elementos, sob a mesma indiferença da metrópole, voltada ainda para as últimas miragens da ""Índia portentosa"",
abriu-se separação radical entre o Sul e o Norte.
Não precisamos rememorar os fatos decisivos das duas regiões. São duas histórias distintas, em que se
averbam movimentos e tendências opostas. Duas sociedades em formação, alheadas por destinos rivais — uma
de todo indiferente ao modo de ser da outra, ambas, entretanto, evolvendo sob os influxos de uma administração
única. Ao passo que no Sul se debuxavam novas tendências, uma subdivisão maior na atividade, maior vigor no
povo mais heterogêneo, mais vivaz, mais prático e aventureiro, um largo movimento progressista em suma —
tudo isto contrastava com as agitações, às vezes mais brilhantes mas sempre menos fecundas, do Norte —
capitanias esparsas e incoerentes, jungidas à mesma rotina, amorfas e imóveis, em função estreita dos alvarás da
corte remota.
A história é ali mais teatral porém menos eloqüente.
Surgem heróis, mas a estatura avulta-lhes, maior, pelo contraste com o meio; belas páginas vibrantes mas
truncadas, sem objetivo certo, em que colaboram, de todo desquitadas entre si, as três raças formadoras.
Mesmo no período culminante, a luta com os holandeses, acampam, claramente distintos em suas tendas de
campanha, os negros de Henrique Dias, os índios de Camarão e os lusitanos de Vieira. Mal unidos na guerra,
distanciam-se na paz. O drama de Palmares, as correrias dos silvícolas, os conflitos na orla dos sertões, violam a
transitória convergência contra o batavo.
Preso no litoral, entre o sertão inabordável e os mares, o velho agregado colonial tendia a chegar ao nosso
tempo, imutável, sob o emperramento de uma centralização estúpida, realizando a anomalia de deslocar para
uma terra nova o ambiente moral de uma sociedade velha.
Bateu-o, felizmente, a onda impetuosa do Sul.
Aqui, a aclimação mais pronta, em meio menos adverso, emprestou, cedo, mais vigor aos forasteiros. Da
absorção das primeiras tribos surgiram os cruzados das conquistas sertanejas, os mamalucos audazes. O
""paulista""— e a significação histórica deste nome abrange os filhos do Rio de Janeiro, Minas, S. Paulo e regiões
do Sul — erigiu-se como um tipo autônomo, aventuroso, rebelde, libérrimo, com a feição perfeita de um
dominador da terra, emancipando-se, insurreto, da tutela longínqua, e afastando-se do mar e dos galeões da
metrópole, investindo com os sertões desconhecidos, delineando a epopéia inédita das ""bandeiras""...
Este movimento admirável reflete o influxo das condições mesológicas. Não houvera distinção alguma
entre os colonizadores de um e outro lado. Em todos prevaleciam os mesmos elementos, que eram o desespero
de Diogo Coelho.
""Piores qua na terra que peste...""
Mas no Sul a força viva restante no temperamento dos que vinham de romper o mar imoto não se delia num
clima enervante; tinha nova componente na própria força da terra; não se dispersava em adaptações difíceis. —
Alterava-se, melhorando. O homem sentia-se forte. Deslocado apenas o teatro dos grandes cometimentos, podia
volver para o sertão impérvio a mesma audácia que o precipitara nos périplos africanos.
Além disto — frisemos este ponto escandalizando embora os nossos minúsculos historiógrafos — a
disposição orográfica libertava-o da preocupação de defender o litoral, onde aproava a cobiça do estrangeiro.
A serra do Mar tem um notável perfil em nossa história. A prumo sobre o Atlântico desdobra-se como a
cortina de baluarte desmedido. De encontro às suas escarpas embatia, fragílima, a ânsia guerreira dos Cavendish
e dos Fenton. No alto, volvendo o olhar em cheio para os chapadões, o forasteiro sentia-se em segurança. Estava
sobre ameias intransponíveis que o punham do mesmo passo a cavaleiro do invasor e da metrópole. Transposta a
montanha — arqueada como a precinta de pedra de um continente — era um isolador étnico e um isolador
histórico. Anulava o apego irreprimível ao litoral, que se exercia ao norte; reduzia-o a estreita faixa de mangues
e restingas, ante a qual se amorteciam todas as cobiças, e alteava, sobranceira às frotas, intangível no recesso das
matas, a atração misteriosa das minas...
Ainda mais — o seu relevo especial torna-a um condensador de primeira ordem, no precipitar a evaporação
oceânica.
Os rios que se derivam pelas suas vertentes nascem de algum modo no mar. Rolam as águas num sentido
oposto à costa. Entranham-se no interior, correndo em cheio para os sertões. Dão ao forasteiro a sugestão
irresistível das ""entradas"".
A terra atrai o homem; chama-o para o seio fecundo; encanta-o pelo aspecto formosíssimo; arrebata-o,
afinal, irresistivelmente na correnteza dos rios.
Daí o traçado eloqüentíssimo do Tietê, diretriz preponderante nesse domínio do solo. Enquanto no S.
Francisco, no Paraíba, no Amazonas, e em todos os cursos d'água da borda oriental, o acesso para o interior
seguia ao arrepio das correntes, ou embatia nas cachoeiras que tombam dos socalcos dos planaltos, ele levava os
sertanistas, sem uma remada, para o rio Grande e daí ao Paraná e ao Paranaíba. Era a penetração em Minas, em
Goiás, em Santa Catarina, no Rio Grande do Sul, no Mato Grosso, no Brasil inteiro. Segundo estas linhas de
menor resistência, que definem os lineamentos mais claros da expansão colonial, não se opunham, como ao
norte, renteando o passo às bandeiras, a esterilidade da terra, a barreira intangível dos descampados brutos.
Assim é fácil mostrar como esta distinção de ordem física esclarece as anomalias e contrastes entre os
sucessos nos dois pontos do país, sobretudo no período agudo da crise colonial, no século 17.
Enquanto o domínio holandês, centralizando-se em Pernambuco, reagia por toda a costa oriental, da Bahia
ao Maranhão, e se travavam recontros memoráveis em que, solidárias, enterreiravam o inimigo comum as nossas
três raças formadoras, o sulista, absolutamente alheio àquela agitação, revelava, na rebeldia aos decretos da
metrópole, completo divórcio com aqueles lutadores. Era quase um inimigo tão perigoso quanto o batavo. Um
povo estranho de mestiços levantadiços, expandindo outras tendências, norteado por outros destinos, pisando,
resoluto, em demanda de outros rumos, bulas e alvarás entibiadores. Volvia-se em luta aberta com a corte
portuguesa, numa reação tenaz contra os jesuítas. Estes, olvidando o holandês e dirigindo-se, com Ruy de
Montoya a Madri e Dias Tãno a Roma, apontavam-no como inimigo mais sério.
De feito, enquanto em Pernambuco as tropas de von Schoppe preparavam o governo de Nassau, em S.
Paulo se arquitetava o drama sombrio de Guaíra. E quando a restauração em Portugal veio alentar em toda a
linha a repulsa ao invasor, congregando de novo os combatentes exaustos, os sulistas frisaram ainda mais esta separação de destinos, aproveitando-se do mesmo fato para estadearem a autonomia franca, no reinado de um
minuto de Amador Bueno.
Não temos contraste maior na nossa história. Está nele a sua feição verdadeiramente nacional. Fora disto
mal a vislumbramos nas cortes espetaculosas dos governadores, na Bahia, onde imperava a Companhia de Jesus
com o privilégio da conquista das almas, eufemismo casuístico disfarçando o monopólio do braço indígena.
Na plenitude do século 17 o contraste se acentua.
Os homens do Sul irradiam pelo país inteiro. Abordam as raias extremas do Equador. Até aos últimos
quartéis do século 18, o povoamento segue as trilhas embaralhadas das bandeiras. Seguiam sucessivas,
incansáveis, com a fatalidade de uma lei, porque traduziam, com efeito, uma queda de potenciais, as grandes
caravanas guerreiras, vagas humanas desencadeadas em todos os quadrantes, invadindo a própria terra,
batendo-a em todos os pontos, descobrindo-a depois do descobrimento, desvendando-lhe o seio rutilante das
minas.
Fora do litoral, em que se refletia a decadência da metrópole e todos os vícios de uma nacionalidade em
decomposição insanável, aqueles sertanistas, avantajando-se às terras extremas de Pernambuco ao Amazonas,
semelhavam uma outra raça, no arrojo temerário e resistência aos reveses.
Quando as correrias do bárbaro ameaçavam a Bahia, ou Pernambuco, ou a Paraíba, e os quilombos se
escalonavam pelas matas, nos últimos refúgios do africano revoltoso — o sulista, di-lo a grosseira odisséia de
Palmares, surgia como o debelador clássico desses perigos, o empreiteiro predileto das grandes hecatombes.
É que o filho do Norte não tinha um meio físico que o blindasse de igual soma de energias. Se tal
acontecesse, as bandeiras irromperiam também do oriente e do norte e, esmagado num movimento convergente,
o elemento indígena desapareceria sem traços remanescentes. Mas o colono nortista, nas entradas para oeste ou
para o sul, batia logo de encontro à natureza adversa. Refluía prestes ao litoral sem o atrevimento dos
dominadores, dos que se sentem à vontade sobre uma terra amiga, sem as ousadias oriundas da própria atração
das, na segunda metade do século 16, por Sebastião Tourinho, das, na segunda metade do século 16, por
Sebastião Tourinho, no rio Doce, Bastião Álvares, no S. Francisco, e Gabriel Soares, pelo Norte da Bahia até às
cabeceiras do Paraguaçu, embora tivessem depois os estímulos enérgicos das Minas de Prata, de Belchior Dias,
são um pálido arremedo das arremetidas do Anhangüera ou de um Pascoal de Araújo.
Apertados entre os canaviais da costa e o sertão, entre o mar e o deserto, num bloqueio engravecido pela
ação do clima, perderam todo o aprumo e este espírito de revolta, eloqüentíssimo, que ruge em todas as páginas
da história do Sul.
Tal contraste não se baseia, por certo, em causas étnicas primordiais.
Delineada, deste modo, a influência mesológica em nosso movimento histórico, deduz-se a que exerceu
sobre a nossa formação étnica.
Ação do meio na fase inicial da formação das raças
Volvamos ao ponto de partida.
Convindo em que o meio não forma as raças, no nosso caso especial variou demais nos diversos pontos do
território as dosagens de três elementos essenciais. Preparou o advento de sub-raças diferentes pela própria
diversidade das condições de adaptação. Além disso (é hoje fato inegável) as condições exteriores atuam
gravemente sobre as próprias sociedades constituídas, que se deslocam em migrações seculares aparelhadas
embora pelos recursos de uma cultura superior. Se isto se verifica nas raças de todo definidas abordando outros
climas, protegidas pelo ambiente de uma civilização, que é como o plasma sangüíneo desses grandes organismos
coletivos, que não diremos da nossa situação muito diversa ? Neste caso — é evidente — a justaposição dos
caracteres coincide com íntima transfusão de tendências e a longa fase de transformação correspondente erige-se
como período de fraqueza, nas capacidades das raças que se cruzam, alterando o valor relativo da influencia do
meio. Este como que estampa, então, melhor, no corpo em fusão, os seus traços característicos. Sem nos
arriscarmos demais a paralelo ousado, podemos dizer que, para essas reações biológicas complexas, ele tem
agentes mais enérgicos que para as reações químicas da matéria.
Ao calor e à luz, que se exercitam em ambas, adicionam-se, então, a disposição da terra, as modalidades do
clima e essa ação de presença inegável, essa espécie de força catalítica misteriosa que difundem os vários
aspectos da natureza.
Entre nós, vimo-lo, a intensidade destes últimos está longe da uniformidade proclamada. Distribuíram,
como o indica a história, de modo diverso as nossas camadas étnicas, originando uma mestiçagem dissímil.
Não há um tipo antropológico brasileiro.
A formação brasileira no Norte
Procuremos, porém, neste intricado caldeamento a miragem fugitiva de uma sub-raça, efêmera talvez.
Inaptos para discriminar as nossas raças nascentes, acolhamo-nos ao nosso assunto. Definamos rapidamente os
antecedentes históricos do jagunço.
Ante o que vimos a formação brasileira do Norte é mui diversa da do Sul. As circunstâncias históricas, em
grande parte oriundas das circunstâncias físicas, originaram diferenças iniciais no enlace das raças,
prolongando-as até o nosso tempo.
A marcha do povoamento, do Maranhão à Bahia, revela-as.
Os primeiros povoadores
Foi vagaroso. As gentes portuguesas não abordavam o litoral do Norte robustecidas pela força viva das
migrações compactas, grandes massas invasoras capazes, ainda que destacadas do torrão nativo, de conservar,
pelo número, todas as qualidades adquiridas em longo tirocínio histórico. Vinham esparsas, parceladas em
pequenas levas de degredados ou colonos contrafeitos, sem o desempenho viril dos conquistadores.
Deslumbrava-as ainda o Oriente.
O Brasil era a terra do exílio; vasto presídio com que se amedrontavam os heréticos e os relapsos, todos os
passíveis do morra per ello da sombria justiça daqueles tempos. Deste modo nos primeiros tempos o número
reduzido de povoadores contrasta com a vastidão da terra e a grandeza da população indígena. As instruções
dadas, em 1615, ao capitão Fragoso de Albuquerque, a fim de regular com o embaixador espanhol em França o
tratado de tréguas com La Ravardière, são claras a respeito. Ali se afirma ""que as terras do Brasil não estão
despovoadas porque nelas existem mais de 3 mil portugueses"".
Isto para o Brasil todo — mais de cem anos após o descobrimento. . .
Segundo observa Aires de Casal ""a população crescia tão devagar que na época da perda do sr. d. Sebastião
(1580) ainda não havia um estabelecimento fora da ilha de Itamaracá cujos vizinhos andavam por uns duzentos,
com três engenhos de açúcar"".
Quando alguns anos mais tarde se povoou melhor a Bahia, a desproporção entre o elemento europeu e os dois
outros continuou desfavorável, em progressão aritmética perfeita. Segundo Fernão Cardim, ali existiam 2 mil
brancos, 4 mil negros e 6 mil índios. É visível durante muito tempo a predominância do elemento autóctone. Nos
primeiros cruzados, portanto, ele deve ter influído muito.
Os forasteiros que aproavam àquelas plagas eram, ademais, de molde para essa mistura em larga escala.
Homens de guerra, sem lares, afeitos à vida solta dos acampamentos, ou degredados e aventureiros corrompidos,
norteava-os a todos como um aforismo o ultra equinotialem non peccavi, na frase de Barleus. A mancebia com
as caboclas descambou logo em franca devassidão, de que nem o clero se isentava. O padre Nóbrega definiu bem
o fato, na célebre carta ao rei ( 1549) em que, pintando com ingênuo realismo a dissociação dos costumes,
declara estar o interior do país cheio de filhos de cristãos, multiplicando-se segundo os hábitos gentílicos.
Achava conveniente que lhe enviassem órfãs, ou mesmo mulheres ""que fossem erradas, que todas achariam
maridos, por ser a terra larga e grossa"". A primeira mestiçagem fez-se, pois, nos primeiros tempos, intensamente,
entre o europeu e o silvícola. ""Desde cedo, di-lo Casal, os tupiniquins, gentio de boa índole, foram cristianizados
e aparentados com os europeus, sendo inúmeros os brancos naturais do país com casta tupiniquina.""
Por outro lado, embora existissem em grande cópia mesmo no reino, os africanos tiveram, no primeiro
século, uma função inferior. Em muitos lugares rareavam. Eram poucos, diz aquele narrador sincero, no Rio
Grande do Norte, ""onde os índios há largo tempo que foram reduzidos, apesar da sua ferocidade e cujos
descendentes por meio das alianças com os europeus e africanos têm aumentado as classes dos brancos e dos
pardos "".
Estes excertos são expressivos.
Sem idéia alguma preconcebida, pode-se afirmar que a extinção do indígena, no Norte, proveio, segundo o
pensar de Varnhagen, mais em virtude de cruzamentos sucessivos que de verdadeiro extermínio.
Sabe-se ainda que havia no animo dos donatários a preocupação de aproveitar-lhes o mais possível a aliança,
captando-lhes o apego. Este proceder refletia os intuitos da metrópole. Demonstram-no-lo as sucessivas cartas
régias que, de 1570 a 1758 — em que pese ""a uma série nunca interrompida de hesitações e contradições"" —
apareceram como minorativo à ganância dos colonos visando a escravização do selvagem. — Sendo que
algumas, como a de 1680, estendiam a proteção ao ponto de decretar que se concedessem ao gentio terras ""ainda
mesmo as já dadas a outros de sesmaria"", visto que deviam ter preferência os mesmos índios ""naturais senhores
da terra"".
Contribuiu para esta tentativa persistente de incorporação a Companhia de Jesus que, obrigando-se no Sul a
transigências forçadas, dominava no Norte. Excluindo quaisquer intenções condenáveis, os jesuítas ali
realizaram tarefa nobilitadora. Foram ao menos rivais do colono ganancioso. No embate estúpido da
perversidade contra a barbaria, apareceu uma função digna àqueles eternos condenados. Fizeram muito. Eram os
únicos homens disciplinados de seu tempo. Embora quimérica a tentativa de alçar o estado mental do aborígine
às abstrações do monoteísmo, ela teve o valor de o atrair por muito tempo, até a intervenção oportuna de
Pombal, para a nossa história.
O curso das missões, no Norte, em todo o trato de terras do Maranhão à Bahia, patenteia sobretudo um lento
esforço de penetração no âmago das terras sertanejas, das fraldas da Ibiapaba às da Itiúba, que completa de
algum modo a movimentação febril das bandeiras. Se estas difundiam largamente o sangue das três raças pelas
novas paragens descobertas, provocando um entrelaçamento geral, a despeito das perturbações que acarretavam
— os aldeamentos, centros da força atrativa do apostolado, fundiam as malocas em aldeias; unificavam as
cabildas; integravam as tribos. Penetrando fundo nos sertões, graças a um esforço secular, os missionários
salvaram em parte este fator das nossas raças. Surpreendidos vários historiadores pela vinda, em grandíssima
escala, do africano, que iniciada em fins do século 16 nunca mais parou até o nosso (1850) e considerando que
ele foi o melhor aliado do português na quadra colonial, dão-lhe geralmente influência exagerada na formação do
sertanejo do Norte. Entretanto, em que pese a esta invasão de vencidos e infelizes, e à sua fecundidade rara, e a
suas qualidades de adaptação, apuradas na África adusta, é discutível que ela tenha atingido profundamente os
sertões.
É certo que o consórcio afro-lusitano era velho, anterior mesmo ao descobrimento, porque se consumara
desde o século 15, com os azenegues e jalofos de Gil Eanes e Antão Gonçalves. Em 1530 salpintavam as ruas de
Lisboa mais de 10 mil negros, e o mesmo sucedia noutros lugares. Em Évora tinham maioria sobre os brancos.
Os versos de um contemporâneo, Garcia de Resende, são um documento:
""Vemos no reino meter,
Tantos cativos crescer,
Irem-se os naturais,
Que, se assim for, serão mais
Eles que nós, a meu ver.""
A gênese do mulato
Assim a gênese do mulato teve uma sede fora do nosso país. A primeira mestiçagem com o africano operou-se
na metrópole. Entre nós, naturalmente, cresceu. A raça dominada, porém, teve, aqui, dirimidas pela situação
social, as faculdades de desenvolvimento. Organização potente afeita à humildade extrema, sem as rebeldias do
índio, o negro teve, de pronto, sobre os ombros toda a pressão da vida colonial. Era a besta de carga adstrita a
trabalhos sem folga. As velhas ordenações, estatuindo o ""como se podem enjeitar os escravos e bestas por os
acharem doentes ou mancos"", denunciam a brutalidade da época. Além disto — insistamos num ponto
incontroverso — as numerosas importações de escravos se acumulavam no litoral. A grande tarja negra debruava
a costa da Bahia ao Maranhão, mas pouco penetrava o interior. Mesmo em franca revolta, o negro humilde feito
quilombola temeroso, agrupando-se nos mocambos, parecia evitar o âmago do país. Palmares, com seus 30 mil
mocambeiros, distava afinal poucas léguas da costa.
Nesta última a uberdade da terra fixara simultaneamente dois elementos, libertando o indígena. A cultura
extensiva da cana, importada da Madeira, determinara o olvido dos sertões. Já antes da invasão holandesa, do
Rio Grande do Norte à Bahia havia 160 engenhos. E esta exploração, em dilatada escala, progrediu depois em
rápido crescendo.
O elemento africano de algum modo estacou nos vastos canaviais da costa, agrilhoado à terra e
determinando cruzamento de todo diverso do que se fazia no recesso das capitanias. Aí campeava, livre, o
indígena inapto ao trabalho e rebelde sempre, ou mal tolhido nos aldeamentos pela tenacidade dos missionários.
A escravidão negra, constituindo-se derivativo ao egoísmo dos colonos, deixava aqueles mais desembaraçados
que no Sul, nos esforços da catequese. Os próprios sertanistas ao chegarem, ultimando as rotas atrevidas, àquelas
paragens, tinham extinta a combatividade.
Alguns, como Domingos Sertão, cerravam a vida aventureira, atraídos pelos lucros das fazendas de criação,
abertas naqueles grandes latifúndios.
Deste modo se estabeleceu distinção perfeita entre os cruzamentos realizados no sertão e no litoral.
Com efeito, admitido em ambos como denominador comum o elemento branco, o mulato erige-se como
resultado principal do último e o curiboca do primeiro.
Capítulo II
Gênese dos jagunços
A demonstração é positiva. Há um notável traço de originalidade na gênese da população sertaneja, não
diremos do Norte, mas do Brasil subtropical.
Esbocemo-lo; e para não nos delongarmos demais, afastemo-nos pouco do teatro em que se desenrolou o
drama histórico de Canudos, percorrendo rapidamente o rio de São Francisco, “o grande caminho da civilização
brasileira”, conforme o dizer feliz de um historiador .
Vimos, de relance, em páginas anteriores, que ele atravessa as regiões mais dispares. Ampla nas cabeceiras,
a sua dilatada bacia colhe na rede de numerosos afluentes a metade de Minas, na zona das montanhas e das
florestas. Estreita-se depois passando na parte mediana pela paragem formosíssima dos gerais. No curso inferior,
a jusante de Juazeiro, constrita entre pendores que a desnivelam torcendo-a para o mar, torna-se pobre de
tributários, quase todos efêmeros, derivando, apertada por uma corredeira única de centenares de quilômetros,
até Paulo Afonso — e corta a região maninha das caatingas.
Ora, sob esta tríplice disposição, é um diagrama da nossa marcha histórica, refletindo, paralelamente, as
suas modalidades variáveis.
Balanceia a influência do Tietê.
Enquanto este, de traçado incomparavelmente mais próprio a penetração colonizadora, se tornou o caminho
predileto dos sertanistas visando sobretudo a escravização e o “descimento” do gentio, o S. Francisco foi, nas
altas cabeceiras, a sede essencial da agitação mineira; no curso inferior, o teatro das missões; e, na região média,
a tem clássica do regímen pastoril, único compatível com a situação econômica e social da colônia.
Bateram-lhe por igual as margens o bandeirante, o jesuíta e o vaqueiro.
Quando, mais tarde, maior cópia de documentos permitir a reconstrução da vida colonial, do século 17 ao
fim do 18, é possível que o último, de todo olvidado ainda, avulte com o destaque que merece na formação da
nossa gente. Bravo e destemeroso como o primeiro, resignado e tenaz como o segundo, tinha a vantagem de um
atributo supletivo que faltou a ambos — a fixação ao solo.
As bandeiras, sob os dois aspectos que mostram, já destacados, já confundidos, investindo com a tem ou
com o homem, buscando o ouro ou o escravo, desvendavam desmedidas paragens, que não povoavam e
deixavam porventura mais desertas, passando rápidas sobre as malocas e as catas.
A sua história, às vezes inextricável como os dizeres adrede obscuros dos roteiros, traduz a sucessão e
enlace destes estímulos únicos revezando-se quer consoante a índole dos aventureiros, quer de acordo com a
maior ou menor praticabilidade das empresas planeadas. E, neste permanente oscilar entre aqueles dois
desígnios, a sua função realmente útil, no desvendar o desconhecido, repontava como incidente obrigado,
conseqüência inevitável em que se não cuidava.
Assim é que extinta com a expedição de Glimmer (1601) a visão enganadora da serra das Esmeraldas, que
desde meados do século 18 atraíra para os flancos do Espinhaço, um após outros, inacessíveis a constantes
malogros, Bruzzo Spinosa, Sebastião Tourinho, Dias Adorno e Martins Carvalho, e desaparecendo ao norte o
pais encantado que idealizara a imaginação romântica de Gabriel Soares, grande parte do século 17 é dominada
pelas lendas sombrias dos caçadores de escravos, centralizados pela figura brutalmente heróica de Antônio
Raposo. É que se haviam apagado quase que ao mesmo tempo as miragens da misteriosa Sabará-buçu e as das
Minas de Prata, eternamente inatingíveis; até que, renovadas pelas pesquisas indecisas de Pais Leme, que avivou,
depois de um apagamento quase secular, as veredas de Glimmer; alentadas pelas oitavas de ouro de Arzão
pisando em 1693 as mesmas trilhas de Tourinho e Adorno; e ao cabo francamente ressurgindo logo depois com
Bartolomeu Bueno, em Itaberaba, e Miguel Garcia, no Ribeirão do Carmo, as entradas sertanejas volvessem ao
anelo primitivo e, irradiando do distrito de Ouro Preto, se espraiassem de novo, mais fortes, pelo país inteiro.
Ora, durante este período em que, aparentemente, só se observam, no litoral, a luta contra o batavo e, no
âmago dos planaltos, o espantoso ondular das bandeiras, surgira na região que interfere o médio São Francisco
um notável povoamento do qual os resultados somente depois apareceram.
Função histórica do rio S. Francisco
Formara-se obscuramente. Determinaram-no, em começo, as entradas a procura das minas de Moreia que,
embora anônimas e sem brilho, parecem ter-se prolongado até o governo de Lancastro, levando até as serranias
de Macaúbas, além do Paramirim, sucessivas turmas de povoadores . Vedado nos caminhos diretos e normais à
costa, mais curtos porém interrompidos pelos paredões das serras ou trancados pelas matas, o acesso fazia-se
pelo S. Francisco. Abrindo aos exploradores duas entradas únicas, à nascente e à foz, levando os homens do Sul
ao encontro dos homens do Norte, o grande rio erigia-se desde o princípio com a feição de um unificador étnico,
longo traço de união entre as duas sociedades que se não conheciam. Porque provindos dos mais diversos pontos
e origens, ou fossem os paulistas de Domingos Sertão, ou os baianos de Garcia d'Ávila, ou os pernambucanos de
Francisco Caldas, com os seus pequenos exércitos de tabajaras aliados, ou mesmo os portugueses de Manuel
Nunes Viana, que dali partiu da sua fazenda do Escuro, em Carinhanha, para comandar os emboabas no rio das
Mortes, os forasteiros, ao atingirem o âmago daquele sertão, raro voltavam.
A terra, do mesmo passo exuberante e acessível, compensava-lhes a miragem desfeita das minas cobiçadas.
A sua estrutura geológica original criando conformações topográficas em que as serranias, últimos esporões e
contrafortes da cordilheira marítima, têm a atenuante dos tabuleiros vastos; a sua flora complexa e variável, em
que se entrelaçam florestas sem a vastidão e o trançado impenetrável das do litoral, com o “mimoso” das
planuras e o “agreste” das chapadas, desafogadas, todas, salteadamente, nos vastos claros das caatingas; a sua
conformação hidrográfica especial de afluentes que se ajustam, quase simétricos, para o ocidente e o oriente
ligando-a, de um lado à costa, de outro ao centro dos planaltos — foram laços preciosos para a fusão desses
elementos esparsos, atraindo-os, entrelaçando-os. E o regímen pastoril ali se esboçou como uma sugestão
dominadora dos gerais.
Nem faltava para isto, sobre a rara fecundidade do solo recamado de pastagens naturais, um elemento
essencial, o sal, gratuito, nas baixadas salobras dos barreiros .
Constituiu-se, desta maneira favorecida, a extensa zona de criação de gado que já no alvorecer do século 18
ia das raias setentrionais de Minas a Goiás, ao Piauí, aos extremos do Maranhão e Ceará pelo ocidente e norte e
às serranias das lavras baianas, a leste. Povoara-se e crescera autônoma e forte, mas obscura, desadorada dos
cronistas do tempo, de todo esquecida não já pela metrópole longínqua senão pelos próprios governadores e
vice-reis. Não produzia impostos ou rendas que interessassem o egoísmo da coroa. Refletia, entretanto,
contraposta à turbulência do litoral e às aventuras das minas, ""o quase único aspecto tranqüilo da nossa cultura"".
A parte os raros contingentes de povo adores pernambucanos e baianos, a maioria dos criadores opulentos, que
ali se formaram? vinha do sul, constituída pela mesma gente entusiasta e enérgica das bandeiras.
Os jagunços: colaterais prováveis dos paulistas
Segundo o que se colhe em preciosas páginas de Pedro Taques, foram numerosas as famílias de S. Paulo
que, em contínuas migrações, procuraram aqueles rincões longínquos, e acredita-se, aceitando o conceito de um
historiógrafo perspicaz, que o ""vale de S. Francisco, já aliás muito povoado de paulistas e de seus descendentes
desde o século 18, tornou-se uma como colônia quase exclusiva deles"" . É natural por isto que Bartolomeu
Bueno, ao descobrir Goiás, visse, surpreendido, sinais evidentes de predecessores, anônimos pioneiros que ali
tinham chegado, certo, pelo levante, transmontando a serra de Paranã; e que ao se reabrir em 1697 o ciclo mais
notável das pesquisas do ouro, nas agitadas e ruidosas vagas de imigrantes, que rolavam dos flancos orientais da
serra do Espinhaço ao talvegue do rio das Velhas, passassem mais fortes talvez, talvez precedendo as demais no
descobrimento das minas de Caeté, e sulcando-as de meio a meio, e avançando em direção contrária como um
refluxo promanado do Norte, as turmas dos ""baianos"", termo que, como o de ""paulista"", se tornara genérico no
abranger os povoadores setentrionais.
O vaqueiro
É que já se formara no vale médio do grande rio uma raça de cruzados idênticos àqueles mamalucos
estrênuos que tinham nascido em S. Paulo. E não nos demasiamos em arrojada hipótese admitindo que este tipo
extraordinário do paulista, surgindo e decaindo logo no Sul, numa degeneração completa ao ponto de declinar no
próprio território que lhe deu o nome, ali renascesse e, sem os perigos das migrações e do cruzamento, se
conservasse prolongando, intacta, ao nosso tempo, a índole varonil e aventureira dos avós.
Porque ali ficaram, inteiramente divorciados do resto do Brasil e do mundo, murados a leste pela serra
Geral, tolhidos no ocidente pelos amplos campos gerais, que se desatam para o Piauí e que ainda hoje o sertanejo
acredita sem fins.
O meio atraía-os e guardava-os.
As entradas de um e outro lado da meridiana, impróprias à dispersão, facilitavam antes o entrelaçamento
dos extremos do país. Ligavam-nos no espaço e no tempo. Estabelecendo no interior a contigüidade do
povoamento, que faltava ainda em parte na costa, e surgindo entre os nortistas, que lutavam pela autonomia da
pátria nascente, e os sulistas, que lhe alargavam a área, abastecendo-os por igual com as fartas boiadas que
subiam para o vale do rio das Velhas ou desciam até as cabeceiras do Parnaíba, aquela rude sociedade,
incompreendida e olvidada, era o cerne vigoroso da nossa nacionalidade.
Os primeiros sertanistas que a criaram, tendo suplantado em toda a linha o selvagem, depois de o
dominarem escravizaram-no e captaram-no, aproveitando-lhe a índole na nova indústria que abraçavam.
Veio subseqüentemente o cruzamento inevitável. E despontou logo uma raça de curibocas puros quase sem
mescla de sangue africano, facilmente denunciada, hoje, pelo tipo normal daqueles sertanejos. Nasciam de um
amplexo feroz de vitoriosos e vencidos. Criaram-se numa sociedade revolta e aventurosa, sobre a terra farta; e
tiveram, ampliando os seus atributos ancestrais, uma rude escola de forca e de coragem naqueles gerais
amplíssimos, onde ainda hoje ruge impune o jaguar e vagueia a ema velocíssima, ou nas serranias de flancos
despedaçados pela mineração superficial, quando as lavras baianas, mais tarde, lhes deram esse derivativo à
faina dos rodeios.
Fora longo traçar-lhes a evolução do caráter. Caldeadas a índole aventureira do colono e a impulsividade do
indígena, tiveram, ulteriormente, o cultivo do próprio meio que lhes propiciou, pelo insulamento, a conservação
dos atributos e hábitos avoengos, ligeiramente modificados apenas consoante as novas exigências da vida. E ali
estão com as suas vestes características, os seus hábitos antigos, o seu estranho aferro às tradições mais remotas,
o seu sentimento religioso levado até o fanatismo, e o seu exagerado ponto de honra, e o seu folclore belíssimo
de rimas de três séculos...
Raça forte e antiga, de caracteres definidos e imutáveis mesmo nas maiores crises — quando a roupa de
couro do vaqueiro se faz a armadura flexível do jagunço — oriunda de elementos convergentes de todos os
pontos, porém diversa das demais deste país, ela é inegavelmente um expressivo exemplo do quanto importam as
reações do meio. Expandindo-se pelos sertões limítrofes ou próximos, de Goiás, Piauí, Maranhão, Ceará e
Pernambuco, tem um caráter de originalidade completa expresso mesmo nas fundações que erigiu. Todos os
povoados, vilas ou cidades, que lhe animam hoje o território, têm uma origem uniforme bem destacada das dos
demais que demoram ao norte e ao sul.
Enquanto deste lado se levantaram nas cercanias das minas ou à margem das catas, e no extremo norte, a
partir de dilatada linha entre a Itiúba e Ibiapaba, sobre o local de antigas aldeias das missões, ali surgiram, todas,
de antigas fazendas de gado.
Escusamo-nos de apontar exemplos por demais numerosos. Quem considera as povoações do S. Francisco,
das nascentes à foz, assiste à sucessão dos três casos apontados.
Deixa as regiões alpestres, cidades alcandoradas sobre serras, refletindo o arrojo incomparável das
bandeiras; atravessa depois os grandes gerais, desmedidas arenas feitas à sociedade rude, libérrima e forte dos
vaqueiros; e atinge por fim as paragens pouco apetecidas, amaninhadas pelas secas, eleitas aos roteiros lentos e
penosos das missões...
É o que indicam, completando estes ligeiros confrontos, os traçados das fundações jesuíticas, no trato de
terras que há pouco demarcamos.
Fundações jesuíticas na Bahia
Com efeito, ali, totalmente diversos na origem, os atuais povoados sertanejos se formaram de velhas aldeias
de índios, arrebatadas, em 1758, do poder dos padres pela política severa de Pombal. Resumindo-nos aos que
ainda hoje existem, próximos e em torno do lugar onde existia há cinco anos a Tróia de taipa dos jagunços,
vemos, mesmo em tão estreita área, os melhores exemplos.
De fato, em toda esta superfície de terras, que abusivas concessões de sesmarias subordinavam à posse de
uma só família, a de Garcia d'Ávila (Casa da Torre), acham-se povoados antiqüíssimos. De Itapicuru-de-Cima a
Jeremoabo e daí acompanhando o S. Francisco até os sertões de Rodelas e Cabrobó, avançaram logo no século
17 as missões num lento caminhar que continuaria até o nosso tempo.
Não tiveram um historiador.
A extraordinária empresa apenas se retrata, hoje, em raros documentos, escassos demais para traçarem a sua
continuidade. Os que existem, porém, são eloqüentes para o caso especial que consideramos. Dizem, de modo
iniludível, que, enquanto o negro se agitava na azáfama do litoral, o indígena se fixava em aldeamentos que se
tornariam cidades. A solicitude calculada do jesuíta e a rara abnegação dos capuchinhos e franciscanos
incorporavam as tribos à nossa vida nacional e quando no alvorecer do século 18 os paulistas irromperam em
Pambu e na Jacobina, deram de vistas, surpresos, nas paróquias que, ali, já centralizavam cabildas. O primeiro
daqueles lugares, 22 léguas a montante de Paulo Afonso, desde 1682 se incorporara à administração da
metrópole. Um capuchinho dominava-o, desfazendo as dissenções tribais e imperando, humílimo, sobre os
morubixabas mansos. No segundo preponderava, igualmente exclusivo, o elemento indígena da velhíssima
missão do Saí.
Jeremoabo aparece, já em 1698, como julgado, o que permite admitir-se-lhe origem muito mais remota. Aí o
elemento indígena se mesclava ligeiramente com o africano, o canhembora ao quilombola . Incomparavelmente
mais animado do que hoje, o humilde lugarejo desviava para si, não raro, a atenção de João de Lancastro,
governador geral do Brasil, principalmente quando se exacerbavam as rivalidades dos chefes índios, munidos
com as patentes, perfeitamente legais, de capitães. Em 1702 a primeira missão dos franciscanos disciplinou
aqueles lugares, tornando-se mais eficaz que as ameaças do governo. Harmonizaram-se as cabildas; e o afluxo de
silvícolas captados pela Igreja foi tal que em um só dia o vigário de Itapicuru batizou 3.700 catecúmenos .
Perto se erigia, também vetusta, a missão de Maçacará, onde, em 1687, tinha o opulento Garcia d'Ávila uma
companhia de seu regimento. Mais para o sul avultavam outras: Natuba, também bastante antiga aldeia, ereta
pelos jesuítas; Inhambupe, que no elevar-se a paróquia originou larga controvérsia entre os padres e o rico
sesmeiro precitado; Itapicuru ( 1639 ), fundada pelos franciscanos.
Mais para o norte, ao começar o século 18, o povoamento, com os mesmos elementos, continuou mais
intenso, diretamente favorecido pela metrópole.
Na segunda metade do século 17 surgira no sertão de Rodelas a vanguarda das bandeiras do sul. Domingos
Sertão centralizou na sua fazenda do Sobrado o círculo animado da vida sertaneja. A ação desse rude sertanista,
naquela região, não tem tido o relevo que merece. Quase na confluência das capitanias setentrionais, próximo ao
mesmo tempo do Piauí, do Ceará, de Pernambuco e da Bahia, o rústico landlord colonial aplicou no trato de suas
cinqüenta fazendas de criação a índole aventurosa e irrequieta dos curibocas. Ostentando, como os outros
dominadores do solo, um feudalismo achamboado — que o levava a transmudar, em vassalos os foreiros
humildes e em servos os tapuias mansos —, o bandeirante atingindo aquelas paragens, e havendo conseguido o
seu ideal de riqueza e poderio, aliava-se na mesma função integradora ao seu tenaz e humilde adversário, o
padre. 1: que a metrópole, no Norte, secundava, sem vacilar, os esforços deste último. Firmara-se desde muito o
princípio de combater o índio com o próprio índio, de sorte que cada aldeamento de catecúmenos era um reduto
ante as incursões dos silvícolas soltos e indomáveis.
Ao terminar o século 17, Lancastro fundou com o indígena catequizado o arraial da Barra, para atenuar as
depredações dos Acaroazes e Mocoazes. E daquele ponto à feição da corrente do São Francisco sucederam-se os
aldeamentos e as missões, em Nossa Senhora do Pilar, Sorobabé, Pambu, Aracapá, Pontal, Pajeú etc. É evidente,
pois, que, precisamente no trecho dos sertões baianos mais ligados aos dos demais Estados do Norte — em toda
a orla do sertão de Canudos — se estabeleceu desde o alvorecer da nossa história um farto povoamento, em que
sobressaía o aborígine amalgamando-se ao branco e ao negro, sem que estes se avolumassem ao ponto de dirimir
a sua influência inegável.
As fundações ulteriores à expulsão dos jesuítas calcaram-se no mesmo método. Do final do século 18 ao
nosso, em Pombal, no Cumbe, em Bom Conselho e Monte Santo etc., perseverantes missionários, de que é
modelo belíssimo Apolônio de Todi, continuaram até os nossos dias o apostolado penoso.
Ora, toda essa população perdida num recanto dos sertões lá permaneceu até agora, reproduzindo-se livre de
elementos estranhos, como que insulada, e realizando, por isso mesmo, a máxima intensidade de cruzamento
uniforme capaz de justificar o aparecimento de um tipo mestiço bem definido, completo.
Enquanto mil causas perturbadoras complicavam a mestiçagem no litoral revolvido pelas imigrações e pela
guerra; e noutros pontos centrais outros empeços irrompiam no rastro das bandeiras — ali, a população indígena,
aliada aos raros mocambeiros foragidos, brancos escapos à justiça ou aventureiros audazes, persistiu dominante.
Causas favoráveis à formação mestiça nos sertões
distinguindo-a dos cruzamentos no litoral
Não sofismemos a História Causas muito enérgicas determinaram o insulamento e conservação do
autóctone. Destaquemo-las.
Foram, primeiro, as grandes concessões de sesmarias, definidoras da feição mais durável do nosso
feudalismo tacanho.
Os possuidores do solo, de que são modelos clássicos os herdeiros de Antônio Guedes de Brito, eram ciosos
dos dilatados latifúndios, sem raias, avassalando a terra. A custo toleravam a intervenção da própria metrópole.
A ereção de capelas, ou paróquias, em suas terras fazia-se sempre através de controvérsias com os padres; e
embora estes afinal ganhassem a partida caíam de algum modo sob o domínio dos grandes potentados. Estes
dificultavam a entrada de novos povoadores ou concorrentes e tornavam as fazendas de criação, dispersas em
torno das freguesias recém-formadas, poderosos centros de atração à raça mestiça que delas promanava.
Assim, esta se desenvolveu fora do influxo de outros elementos. E entregues à vida pastoril, a que por
índole se afeiçoavam, os curibocas ou cafuzos trigueiros, antecedentes diretos dos vaqueiros atuais, divorciados
inteiramente das gentes do sul e da colonização intensa do litoral, evolveram, adquirindo uma fisionomia
original. Como que se criaram num país diverso.
A carta régia de 7 de fevereiro de 1701 foi, depois, uma medida supletiva desse isolamento. Proibira,
cominando severas penas aos infratores, quaisquer comunicações daquela parte dos sertões com o sul, com as
minas de São Paulo. Nem mesmo as relações comerciais foram toleradas; interditas as mais simples trocas de
produtos.
Ora, além destes motivos, sobreleva-se, considerando a gênese do sertanejo no extremo norte, um outro: o
meio físico dos sertões em todo o vasto território que se alonga do leito do Vaza-Barris ao do Parnaíba, no
ocidente.
Vimos-lhe a fisionomia original: a flora agressiva, o clima impiedoso, as secas periódicas, o solo estéril
crespo de serranias desnudas, insulado entre os esplendores do majestoso araxá do centro dos planaltos e as
grandes matas, que acompanham e orlam a curvatura das costas. Esta região ingrata para a qual o próprio tupi
tinha um termo sugestivo pora-pora-eima, remanescente ainda numa das serranias que a fecham pelo levante (
Borborema ), foi o asilo do tapuia. Batidos pelo português, pelo negro e pelo tupi coligados, refluindo ante o
número, os indômitos Cariris encontraram proteção singular naquele colo duro da terra, escalavrado pelas
tormentas, endurado pela ossamenta rígida das pedras, ressequido pelas soalheiras, esvurmando espinheirais e
caatingas. Ali se amorteciam, caindo no vácuo das chapadas, onde ademais nenhuns indícios se mostravam dos
minérios apetecidos, os arremessos das bandeiras. A tapui-retama misteriosa ataviara-se para o estoicismo do
missionário. As suas veredas multívias e longas retratavam a marcha lenta, torturante e dolorosa dos apóstolos.
As bandeiras, que a alcançavam, decampavam logo, seguindo, rápidas, fugindo, buscando outras paragens.
Assombrava-as a terra, que se modelara para as grandes batalhas silenciosas da fé. Deixavam-na, sem que
nada lhes determinasse a volta; e deixavam em paz o gentio.
Daí a circunstância, revelada por uma observação feliz, de predominarem ainda hoje, nas denominações
geográficas daqueles lugares, termos de origem tapuia resistentes às absorções do português e do tupi, que se
exercitaram noutros pontos. Sem nos delongarmos demais, resumamos às terras circunjacentes a Canudos a
exemplificação deste fato de linguagem, que tão bem traduz uma vicissitude histórica.
""Transpondo o S. Francisco em direção ao sul, penetra-se de novo numa região ingrata pela inclemência do
céu, e vai-se atravessando a bacia elevada do Vaza-Barris, antes de ganhar os trechos esparsos e mais deprimidos
das chapadas baianas que, depois do salto de Paulo Afonso, depois de Canudos e de Monte Santo, levam a
Itiúba, ao Tombador e ao Açuruá. Aí, nesse trecho do pátrio território, aliás dos mais ingratos, onde outrora se
refugiaram os perseguidos destroços dos Orizes, Procás e Cariris, de novo aparecem, designando os lugares, os
nomes bárbaros de procedência tapuia, que nem o português nem o tupi logrou suplantar.
Lêem-se então no mapa da região com a mesma freqüência dos acidentes topográficos os nomes como
Pambu, Patamuté, Uauá, Bendegó, Cumbe, Maçacará, Cocorobó, Jeremoabo, Tragagó, Canché. Chorrochó,
Quincuncá, Conchó, Centocé, Açuruá, Xique-Xique, Jequié, Sincorá, Caculé ou Catolé, Orobó, Mocugé, e
outros, igualmente bárbaros e estranhos.""
É natural que grandes populações sertanejos, de par com as que se constituíam no médio S. Francisco, se
formassem ali com a dosagem preponderante do sangue tapuia. E lá ficassem ablegadas, evolvendo em círculo
apertado durante três séculos, até a nossa idade, num abandono completo, de todo alheio aos nossos destinos,
guardando, intactas, as tradições do passado. De sorte que. hoje, quem atravessa aqueles lugares observa uma
uniformidade notável entre os que os povoam: feições e estaturas variando ligeiramente em torno de um modelo
único, dando a impressão de um tipo antropológico invariável, logo ao primeiro lance de vistas distinto do
mestiço proteiforme do litoral. Porque enquanto este patenteia todos os cambiantes da cor e se erige ainda
indefinido, segundo o predomínio variável dos seus agentes formadores, e homem do sertão parece feito por um
molde único, revelando quase os mesmos caracteres físicos, a mesma tez, variando brevemente do mamaluco
bronzeado ao cafuz trigueiro; cabelo corredio e duro ou levemente ondeado; a mesma envergadura atlética e os
mesmos caracteres morais traduzindo-se nas mesmas superstições. nos mesmos vícios, e nas mesmas virtudes.
A uniformidade, sob estes vários aspectos, é impressionadora. O sertanejo do norte é, inegavelmente, o tipo
de uma subcategoria étnica já constituída.
Um parêntesis irritante
Abramos um parêntesis...
A mistura de raças mui diversas é, na maioria dos casos, prejudicial. Ante as conclusões do evolucionismo,
ainda quando reaja sobre o produto o influxo de uma raça superior, despontam vivíssimos estigmas da inferior. A
mestiçagem extremada é um retrocesso. O indo-europeu, o negro e o brasílio-guarani ou o tapuia, exprimem
estádios evolutivos que se fronteiam, e o cruzamento, sobre obliterar as qualidades preeminentes do primeiro, é
um estimulante à revivescência dos atributos primitivos dos últimos. De sorte que o mestiço — traço de união
entre as raças, breve existência individual em que se comprimem esforços seculares — é, quase sempre, um
desequilibrado. Foville compara-os, de um modo geral, aos histéricos. Mas o desequilíbrio nervoso, em tal caso,
é incurável: não há terapêutica para este embater de tendências antagonistas, de raças repentinamente
aproximadas, fundidas num organismo isolado. Não se compreende que após divergirem extremadamente,
através de largos períodos entre os quais a História é um momento, possam dois ou três povos convergir, de
súbito, combinando constituições mentais diversas, anulando em pouco tempo distinções resultantes de um lento
trabalho seletivo. Como nas somas algébricas, as qualidades dos elementos que se justapõem não se
acrescentam, subtraem-se ou destróem-se segundo os caracteres positivos e negativos em presença. E o mestiço
— mulato, mamaluco ou cafuz — menos que um intermediário, é um decaído, sem a energia física dos
ascendentes selvagens, sem a altitude intelectual dos ancestrais superiores. Contrastando com a fecundidade que
acaso possua, ele revela casos de hibridez moral extraordinários: espíritos fulgurantes, às vezes, mais frágeis,
irrequietos, inconstantes, deslumbrando um momento e extinguindo-se prestes, feridos pela fatalidade das leis
biológicas, chumbados ao plano inferior da raça menos favorecida. Impotente para formar qualquer solidariedade
entre as gerações opostas, de que resulta, reflete-lhes os vários aspectos predominantes num jogo permanente de
antíteses. E quando avulta — não são raros os casos — capaz das grandes generalizações ou de associar as mais
complexas relações abstratas, todo esse vigor mental repousa (salvante os casos excepcionais cujo destaque
justifica o conceito) sobre uma moralidade rudimentar, em que se pressente o automatismo impulsivo das raças
inferiores.
É que nessa concorrência admirável dos povos, evolvendo todos em luta sem tréguas, na qual a seleção
capitaliza atributos que a hereditariedade conserva, o mestiço é um intruso. Não lutou; não é uma integração de
esforços; é alguma coisa de dispersivo e dissolvente; surge, de repente, sem caracteres próprios, oscilando entre
influxos opostos de legados discordes. A tendência à regressão às raças matrizes caracteriza a sua instabilidade.
É a tendência instintiva a uma situação de equilíbrio. As leis naturais pelo próprio jogo parecem extinguir, a
pouco e pouco, o produto anômalo que as viola, afogando-o nas próprias fontes geradoras. O mulato despreza
então, irresistivelmente, o negro e procura com uma tenacidade ansiosíssima cruzamentos que apaguem na sua
prole o estigma da fronte escurecida; o mamaluco faz-se o bandeirante inexorável, precipitando-se, ferozmente,
sobre as cabildas aterradas...
Esta tendência é expressiva. Reata, de algum modo, a série contínua da evolução, que a mestiçagem partira.
A raça superior torna-se o objetivo remoto para onde tendem os mestiços deprimidos e estes, procurando-a,
obedecem ao próprio instinto da conservação e da defesa. É que são invioláveis as leis do desenvolvimento das
espécies; e se toda a sutileza dos missionários tem sido impotente para afeiçoar o espírito do selvagem às mais
simples concepções de um estado mental superior; se não há esforços que consigam do africano, entregue à
solicitude dos melhores mestres, o aproximar-se sequer do nível intelectual médio do indo-europeu — porque
todo o homem é antes de tudo uma integração de esforços da raça a que pertence e o seu cérebro uma herança —
, como compreender-se a normalidade do tipo antropológico que aparece, de improviso, enfeixando tendências
tão opostas ?
Uma raça forte
Entretanto a observação cuidadosa do sertanejo do Norte mostra atenuado esse antagonismo de tendências e
uma quase fixidez nos caracteres fisiológicos do tipo emergente.
Este fato, que contrabate, ao parecer, as linhas anteriores, é a sua contraprova frisante.
Com efeito, é inegável que para a feição anormal dos mestiços de raças mui diversas contribui bastante o
fato de acarretar o elemento étnico mais elevado, mais elevadas condições de vida, de onde decorre a
acomodação penosa e difícil para aqueles. E desde que desça sobre eles a sobrecarga intelectual e moral de uma
civilização, o desequilíbrio é inevitável.
A índole incoerente, desigual e revolta do mestiço, como que denota um íntimo e intenso esforço de
eliminação dos atributos que lhe impedem a vida num meio mais adiantado e complexo. Reflete — em círculo
diminuto — esse combate surdo e formidável, que é a própria luta pela vida das raças, luta comovedora e eterna
caracterizada pelo belo axioma de Gumplowicz como a força motriz da História. O grande professor de Gratz
não a considerou sob este aspecto. A verdade, porém, é que se todo o elemento étnico forte ""tende subordinar ao
seu destino o elemento mais fraco antes o qual se acha"", encontra na mestiçagem um caso perturbador. A
expansão irresistível do seu círculo singenético, porém, por tal forma iludida, retarda-se apenas. Não se extingue.
A luta transmuda-se, tornando-se mais grave. Volve do caso vulgar, do extermínio franco da raça inferior pela
guerra, à sua eliminação lenta, à sua absorção vagarosa, à sua diluição no cruzamento. E durante o curso deste
processo redutor, os mestiços emergentes, variáveis, com todas as nuanças da cor, da forma e do caráter, sem
feições definidas, sem vigor, e as mais vezes inviáveis, nada mais são, em última análise, do que os mutilados
inevitáveis do conflito que perdura, imperceptível, pelo correr das idades.
É que neste caso a raça forte não destrói a fraca pelas armas, esmaga-a pela civilização.
Ora, os nossos rudes patrícios dos sertões do Norte forraram-se a esta última. O abandono em que jazeram teve
função benéfica. Libertou-os da adaptação penosíssima a um estádio social superior, e, simultaneamente, evitou
que descambassem para as aberrações e vícios dos meios adiantados.
A fusão entre eles operou-se em circunstâncias mais compatíveis com os elementos inferiores. O fator
étnico preeminente transmitindo-lhes as tendências civilizadoras não lhes impôs a civilização.
Este fato destaca fundamentalmente a mestiçagem dos sertões da do litoral. São formações distintas, senão
pelos elementos, pelas condições do meio. O contraste entre ambas ressalta ao paralelo mais simples. O sertanejo
tomando em larga escala, do selvagem, a intimidade com o meio físico, que ao invés de deprimir enrija o seu
organismo potente, reflete, na índole e nos costumes, das outras raças formadoras apenas aqueles atributos mais
ajustáveis à sua fase social incipiente.
É um retrógrado; não é um degenerado. Por isto mesmo que as vicissitudes históricas o libertaram, na fase
delicadíssima da sua formação, das exigências desproporcionadas de uma cultura de empréstimo, prepararam-no
para a conquistar um dia.
A sua evolução psíquica, por mais demorada que esteja destinada a ser, tem, agora, a garantia de um tipo
fisicamente constituído e forte. Aquela raça cruzada surge autônoma e, de algum modo, original, transfigurando,
pela própria combinação, todos os atributos herdados; de sorte que, despeada afinal da existência selvagem, pode
alcançar a `:ida civilizada por isto mesmo que não a atingiu de repente.
Aparece logicamente.
Ao invés da inversão extravagante que se observa nas cidades do litoral, onde funções altamente complexas
se impõem a órgãos mal constituídos, comprimindo-os e atrofiando-os antes do pleno desenvolvimento — nos
sertões a integridade orgânica do mestiço desponta inteiriça e robusta, imune de estranhas mesclas, capaz de
evolver, diferenciando-se, acomodando-se a novos e mais altos destinos. porque é a sólida base física do
desenvolvimento moral ulterior.
Deixemos, porém, este divagar pouco atraente.
Prossigamos considerando diretamente a figura original dos nossos patrícios retardatários. Isto sem método,
despretensiosamente, evitando os garbosos neologismos etnológicos.
Faltaram-nos, do mesmo passo, tempo e competência para nos enredarmos em fantasias
psíquico-geométricas, que hoje se exageram num quase materialismo filosófico, medindo o ângulo facial, ou
traçando a norma verticalis dos jagunços.
Se nos embaraçássemos nas imaginosas linhas dessa espécie de topografia psíquica, de que tanto se tem
abusado, talvez não os compreendêssemos melhor. Sejamos simples copistas.
Reproduzamos, intactas, todas as impressões, verdadeiras ou ilusórias, que tivemos quando, de repente,
acompanhando a celeridade de uma marcha militar, demos de frente, numa volta do sertão, com aqueles
desconhecidos singulares, que ali estão — abandonados — há três séculos.
CapítuloIII
O sertanejo
O sertanejo é, antes de tudo, um forte. Não tem o raquitismo exaustivo dos mestiços neurastênicos do
litoral.
A sua aparência, entretanto, ao primeiro lance de vista, revela o contrário. Falta-lhe a plástica impecável, o
desempeno, a estrutura corretíssima das organizações atléticas.
É desgracioso, desengonçado, torto. Hércules-Quasímodo, reflete no aspecto a fealdade típica dos fracos. O
andar sem firmeza, sem aprumo, quase gingante e sinuoso, aparenta a translação de membros desarticulados.
Agrava-o a postura normalmente abatida, num manifestar de displicência que lhe dá um caráter de humildade
deprimente. A pé, quando parado, recosta-se invariavelmente ao primeiro umbral ou parede que encontra; a
cavalo, se sofreia o animal para trocar duas palavras com um conhecido, cai logo sobre um dos estribos,
descansando sobre a espenda da sela. Caminhando, mesmo a passo rápido, não traça trajetória retilínea e firme.
Avança celeremente, num bambolear característico, de que parecem ser o traço geométrico os meandros das
trilhas sertanejas. E se na marcha estaca pelo motivo mais vulgar, para enrolar um cigarro, bater o isqueiro, ou
travar ligeira conversa com um amigo, cai logo — cai é o termo — de cócoras, atravessando largo tempo numa
posição de equilíbrio instável, em que todo o seu corpo fica suspenso pelos dedos grandes dos pés, sentado sobre
os calcanhares, com uma simplicidade a um tempo ridícula e adorável.
É o homem permanentemente fatigado.
Reflete a preguiça invencível, a atonia muscular perene, em tudo: na palavra remorada, no gesto contrafeito,
no andar desaprumado, na cadência langorosa das modinhas, na tendência constante à imobilidade e à quietude.
Entretanto, toda esta aparência de cansaço ilude.
Nada é mais surpreendedor do que vê-la desaparecer de improviso. Naquela organização combalida
operam-se, em segundos, transmutações completas. Basta o aparecimento de qualquer incidente exigindo-lhe o
desencadear das energias adormecidas. O homem transfigura-se. Empertiga-se, estadeando novos relevos, novas
linhas na estatura e no gesto; e a cabeça firma-se-lhe, alta, sobre os ombros possantes aclarada pelo olhar
desassombrado e forte; e corrigem-se-lhe, prestes, numa descarga nervosa instantânea, todos os efeitos do
relaxamento habitual dos órgãos; e da figura vulgar do tabaréu canhestro reponta, inesperadamente, o aspecto
dominador de um titã acobreado e potente, num desdobramento surpreendente de força e agilidade
extraordinárias.
Este contraste impõe-se ao mais leve exame. Revela-se a todo o momento, em todos os pormenores da vida
sertaneja — caracterizado sempre pela intercadência impressionadora entre extremos impulsos e apatias longas.
É impossível idear-se cavaleiro mais chucro e deselegante; sem posição, pernas coladas ao bojo da
montaria, tronco pendido para a frente e oscilando à feição da andadura dos pequenos cavalos do sertão,
desferrados e maltratados, resistentes e rápidos como poucos. Nesta atitude indolente, acompanhando
morosamente, a passo, pelas chapadas, o passo tardo das boiadas, o vaqueiro preguiçoso quase transforma o
“campeão” que cavalga na rede amolecedora em que atravessa dois terços da existência.
Mas se uma rês “alevantada” envereda, esquiva, adiante, pela caatinga garranchenta, ou se uma ponta de
gado, ao longe, se trasmalha, ei-lo em momentos transformado, cravando os acicates de rosetas largas nas
ilhargas da montaria e partindo como um dardo, atufando-se velozmente nos dédalos inextricáveis das juremas.
Vimo-lo neste steeple-chase bárbaro.
Não há contê-lo, então, no ímpeto. Que se lhe antolhem quebradas, acervos de pedras, coivaras, moiras de
espinhos ou barrancas de ribeirões, nada lhe impede encalçar o garrote desgarrado, porque “por onde passa o boi
passa o vaqueiro com o seu cavalo”...
Colado ao dorso deste, confundindo-se com ele, graças a pressão dos jarretes firmes, realiza a criação
bizarra de um centauro bronco: emergindo inopinadamente nas clareiras; mergulhando nas macegas altas;
saltando valos e ipueiras; vingando cômoros alçados; rompendo, célere, pelos espinheirais mordentes;
precipitando-se, a toda brida, no largo dos tabuleiros . . .
A sua compleição robusta ostenta-se, nesse momento, em toda a plenitude. Como que é o cavaleiro robusto
que empresta vigor ao cavalo pequenino e frágil, sustenta-o nas rédeas improvisadas de caroá, suspendendo-o
nas esporas, arrojando-o na carreira -estribando curto, pernas encolhidas, joelhos fincados para a frente, torso
colado no arção — ""escanchado no rastro"" do novilho esquivo: aqui curvando-se agilíssimo, sob um ramalho,
que lhe roça quase pela sela; além desmontando, de repente, como um acrobata, agarrado às crinas do animal,
para fugir ao embate de um tronco percebido no último momento e galgando, logo depois, num pulo, o selim; —
e galopando sempre, através de todos os obstáculos, sopesando à destra sem a perder nunca, sem a deixar no
inextricável dos cipoais, a longa aguilhada de ponta de ferro encastoada em couro, que por si só constituiria,
noutras mãos, sérios obstáculos à travessia...
Mas terminada a refrega, restituída ao rebanho a rès dominada, ei-lo, de novo caído sobre o lombilho
retovado, outra vez desgracioso e inerte, oscilando à feição da andadura lenta' com a aparência triste de um
inválido esmorecido.
Tipos díspares: o jagunço e o gaúcho
O gaúcho do Sul, ao encontrá-lo nesse instante, sobreolhá-lo-ia comiserado.
O vaqueiro do Norte é a sua antítese. Na postura, no gesto, na palavra, na índole e nos hábitos não há
equipará-los. O primeiro, filho dos plainos sem fins, afeito às correrias fáceis nos pampas e adaptado a uma
natureza carinhosa que o encanta, tem, certo, feição mais cavalheirosa e atraente. A luta pela vida não lhe
assume o caráter selvagem da dos sertões do Norte. Não conhece os horrores da seca e os combates cruentos
com a terra árida e exsicada. Não o entristecem as cenas periódicas da devastação e da miséria, o quadro
assombrador da absoluta pobreza do solo calcinado, exaurido pela adustão dos sóis bravios do Equador. Não
tem, no meio das horas tranqüilas da felicidade, a preocupação do futuro, que é sempre uma ameaça, tornando
aquela instável e fugitiva. Desperta para a vida amando a natureza deslumbrante que o aviventa; e passa pela
vida, aventureiro, jovial, diserto, valente e fanfarrão, despreocupado, tendo o trabalho como uma diversão que
lhe permite as disparadas, domando distancias, nas pastagens planas, tendo aos ombros, palpitando aos ventos o
pala inseparável, como uma flâmula festivamente desdobrada.
As suas vestes são um traje de festa, ante a vestimenta rústica do vaqueiro. As amplas bombachas, adrede
talhadas para a movimentação fácil sobre os baguaís, no galope fechado ou no corcovear raivoso, não se
estragam em espinhos dilaceradores de caatingas. O seu poncho vistoso jamais fica perdido, embaraçado nos
esgalhos das árvores garranchentas. E, rompendo pelas coxilhas, arrebatadamente na marcha do redomão
desensofrido, calçando as largas botas russilhonas, em que retinem as rosetas das esporas de prata; lenço de seda
encarnado, ao pescoço; coberto pelo sombreiro de enormes abas flexíveis, e tendo à cinta, rebrilhando, presas
pela guaiaca, a pistola e a faca — é um vitorioso jovial e forte. O cavalo, sócio inseparável desta existência algo
romanesca, é quase objeto de luxo. Demonstra-o o arreamento complicado e espetaculoso. O gaúcho andrajoso
sobre um ""pingo"" bem aperado está decente, está corretíssimo. Pode atravessar sem vexames os vilarejos em
festa.
O vaqueiro
O vaqueiro, porém, criou-se em condições opostas, em uma intermitência, raro perturbada, de horas felizes
e horas cruéis, de abastança e misérias — tendo sobre a cabeça, como ameaça perene, o sol, arrastando de
envolta, no volver das estações, períodos sucessivos de devastações e desgraças.
Atravessou a mocidade numa intercadência de catástrofes. Fez-se homem, quase sem ter sido criança.
Salteou-o, logo, intercalando-lhe agruras nas horas festivas da infância, o espantalho das secas no sertão. Cedo
encarou a existência pela sua face tormentosa. É um condenado à vida. Compreendeu-se envolvido em combate
sem tréguas, exigindo-lhe imperiosamente a convergência de todas as energias.
Fez-se forte, esperto, resignado e prático.
Aprestou-se, cedo, para a luta.
O seu aspecto recorda, vagamente, à primeira vista, o de guerreiro antigo exausto da refrega. As vestes são
uma armadura. Envolto no gibão de couro curtido, de bode ou de vaqueta; apertado no colete também de couro;
calçando as perneiras, de couro curtido ainda, muito justas, cosidas às pernas e subindo até as virilhas,
articuladas em joelheiras de sola; e resguardados os pés e as mãos pelas luvas e guarda-pés de pele de veado — é
como a forma grosseira de um campeador medieval desgarrado em nosso tempo.
Esta armadura, porém, de um vermelho pardo, como se fosse de bronze flexível, não tem cintilações, não
rebrilha ferida pelo sol. É fosca e poenta. Envolve ao combatente de uma batalha sem vitórias.. .
A sela da montaria, feita por ele mesmo, imita o lombilho rio-grandense, mas é mais curta e cavada, sem os
apetrechos luxuosos daquele. São acessórios uma manta de pele de bode, um couro resistente, cobrindo as ancas
do animal, peitorais que lhe resguardam o peito, e as joelheiras apresilhadas às juntas.
Este equipamento do homem e do cavalo talha-se à feição do meio. Vestidos doutro modo não romperiam,
incólumes, as caatingas e os pedregais cortantes.
Nada mais monótono e feio, entretanto, do que esta vestimenta original, de uma só cor — o pardo
avermelhado do couro curtido — sem uma variante, sem uma lista sequer diversamente colorida. Apenas, de
longe em longe, nas raras encamisadas em que aos descantes da viola o matuto deslembra as horas fatigadas,
surge uma novidade — um colete vistoso de pele de gato do mato ou de suçuarana, com o pelo mosqueado
virado para fora, ou uma bromélia rubra e álacre fincada no chapéu de couro.
Isto, porém, é incidente passageiro e raro.
Extintas as horas do folguedo, o sertanejo perde o desgarre folgazão — largamente expandido nos
sapateados, em que o estalo seco das alpercatas sobre o chão se perde nos tinidos das esporas e soalhas dos
pandeiros, acompanhando a cadência das violas vibrando nos rasgados — e cai na postura habitual, tosco,
deselegante e anguloso, num estranho manifestar de desnervamento e cansaço extraordinários.
Ora, nada mais explicável do que este permanente contraste entre extremas manifestações de força e
agilidade e longos intervalos de apatia.
Perfeita tradução moral dos agentes físicos da sua terra, o sertanejo do norte teve uma árdua aprendizagem
de reveses. Afez-se, cedo, a encontrá-los, de chofre, e a reagir, de pronto.
Atravessa a vida entre ciladas, surpresas repentinas de uma natureza incompreensível, e não perde um
minuto de tréguas. É o batalhador perenemente combalido e exausto, perenemente audacioso e forte;
preparando-se sempre para um rencontro que não vence e em que se não deixa vencer; passando da máxima
quietude à máxima agitação; da rede preguiçosa e cômoda para o lombilho duro, que o arrebata como um raio
pelos arrastadores estreitos, em busca das malhadas. Reflete, nestas aparências que se contrabatem, a própria
natureza que o rodeia — passiva ante o jogo dos elementos e passando, sem transição sensível, de uma estação à
outra, da maior exuberância à penúria dos desertos incendidos, sob o reverberar dos estios abrasantes.
É inconstante como ela. É natural que o seja. Viver é adaptar-se. Ela talhou-o à sua imagem: bárbaro,
impetuoso, abrupto. . .
O gaúcho
O gaúcho, o pealador valente, é, certo, inimitável, numa carga guerreira; precipitando-se, ao ressoar
estrídulo dos clarins vibrantes, pelos pampas, com o conto da lança enristada, firme no estribo; atufando-se
loucamente nos entreveros; desaparecendo, com um grito triunfal, na voragem do combate, onde espadanam
cintilações de espadas; transmudando o cavalo em projétil e varanda quadrados e levando de rojo o adversário no
rompão das ferraduras, ou tombando, prestes, na luta, em que entra com despreocupação soberana pela vida.
O jagunço
O jagunço é menos teatralmente heróico; é mais tenaz; é mais resistente; é mais perigoso; é mais forte; é
mais duro.
Raro assume esta feição romanesca e gloriosa. Procura o adversário com o propósito firme de o destruir,
seja como for.
Está afeiçoado aos prélios obscuros e longos, sem expansões entusiásticas. A sua vida é uma conquista
arduamente feita, em faina diuturna. Guarda-a como capital precioso. Não esperdiça a mais ligeira contração
muscular, a mais leve vibração nervosa sem a certeza do resultado. Calcula friamente o pugilato. Ao ""riscar da
faca"" não dá um golpe em falso. Ao apontar a lazarina longa ou o trabuco pesado, dorme na pontaria. . .
Se, ineficaz o arremesso fulminante, contrário enterreirado não baqueia, o gaúcho, vencido ou pulseado, é
fragílimo nas aperturas de uma situação inferior ou indecisa.
O jagunço, não. Recua. Mas, no recuar é mais temeroso ainda. É um negacear demoníaco. O adversário
tem, daquela hora em diante, visando-o pelo cano da espingarda, um ódio inextinguível, oculto no sombreado
das tocaias...
Os vaqueiros
Esta oposição de caracteres acentua-se nas quadras normais.
Assim todo sertanejo é vaqueiro. À parte a agricultura rudimentar das plantações da vazante pela beira dos
rios, para a aquisição de cereais de primeira necessidade, a criação de gado é, ali, a sorte de trabalho menos
impropriada ao homem e à terra.
Entretanto não há vislumbrar nas fazendas do sertão a azáfama festiva das estâncias do Sul.
""Parar o rodeio"" é para o gaúcho uma festa diária, de que as cavalhadas espetaculosas são ampliações
apenas. No âmbito estreito das mangueiras ou em pleno campo, ajuntando o gado costeado ou encalçando os
bois esquivos pelas sangas e banhados, os pealadores, capatazes e peões, preando à ilhapa dos laços o potro
bravio, ou fazendo tombar, fulminado pelas bolas silvantes, o touro alçado, nas evoluções rápidas das carreiras,
como se tirassem ""argolinhas"", seguem no alarido e na alacridade de uma diversão tumultuosa. Nos trabalhos
mais calmos, quando nos rodeios marcam o gado, curam-lhe as feridas, apartam os que se destinam às
charqueadas, separam os novilhos tambeiros ou escolhem os baguais condenados às chilenas do domador — o
mesmo fogo, que encandesce as marcas, dá as brasas para os ágapes rudes de assados com couro ou ferve a água
para o chimarrão amargo.
Decorre-lhes a vida variada e farta.
Servidão
inconsciente
O mesmo não acontece ao Norte. Ao contrário do entancieiro, o fazendeiro dos sertões vive no litoral, longe
dos dilatados domínios que nunca viu, às vezes. Herdaram velho vício histórico. Como os opulentos sesmeiros
da colônia, usufruem, parasitariamente, as rendas das suas terras, sem divisas fixas. Os vaqueiros são-lhes servos
submissos.
Graças a um contrato pelo qual percebem certa percentagem dos produtos, ali ficam, anônimos — nascendo,
vivendo e morrendo na mesma quadra de terra — perdidos nos arrastadores e mocambos; e cuidando, a vida
inteira, fielmente, dos rebanhos que Ihes não pertencem.
O verdadeiro dono, ausente, conhece-lhes a fidelidade sem par. Não os fiscaliza. Sabe-lhes, quando muito,
os nomes.
Envoltos, então, no traje característico, os sertanejos encourados erguem a choupana de pau-a-pique à borda
das cacimbas, rapidamente, como se armassem tendas; e entregam-se, abnegados, à servidão que não avaliam.
A primeira coisa que fazem é aprender o a b c e, afinal, toda a exigência da arte em que são eméritos:
conhecer os ""ferros"" das suas fazendas e os das circunvizinhas. Chamam-se assim os sinais de todos os feitios,
ou letras, ou desenhos caprichosos como siglas, impressos, por tatuagem a fogo, nas ancas do animal,
completados pelos cortes, em pequenos ângulos, nas orelhas. Ferrado o boi, está garantido. Pode romper
tranqueiras e tresmalhar-se. Leva, indelével, a indicação que o reporá na ""solta"" primitiva. Porque o vaqueiro não
se contentando com ter de cor os ferros de sua fazenda, aprende os das demais. Chega, às vezes por
extraordinário esforço de memória, a conhecer, uma por uma, não só as reses de que cuida, como as dos
vizinhos, incluindo-lhes a genealogia e hábitos característicos, e os nomes, e as idades etc. Deste modo, quando
surge no seu logrador um animal alheio, cuja marca conhece, o restitui de pronto. No caso contrário, conserva o
intruso, tratando-o como aos demais. Mas não o leva à feira anual, nem o aplica em trabalho algum; deixa-o
morrer de velho. Não lhe pertence.
Se é uma vaca e dá cria, ferra a esta com o mesmo sinal desconhecido, que reproduz com perfeição
admirável; e assim pratica com toda a descendência daquela. De quatro em quatro bezerros, porém, separa um,
para si. É a sua paga. Estabelece com o patrão desconhecido o mesmo convênio que tem com o outro. E cumpre
estritamente, sem juízes e sem testemunhas, o estranho contrato, que ninguém escreveu ou sugeriu.
Sucede muitas vezes ser decifrada, afinal, uma marca somente depois de muitos anos, e o criador feliz
receber, ao invés da peça única que lhe fugira e da qual se deslembrara, numa ponta de gado, todos os produtos
dela.
Parece fantasia este fato, vulgar, entretanto, nos sertões.
Indicamo-lo como traço encantador da probidade dos matutos. Os grandes proprietários da terra e dos
rebanhos a conhecem. Têm, todos, com o vaqueiro o mesmo trato de parceria, resumido na cláusula única de lhe
darem, em troca dos cuidados que ele despende, um quarto dos produtos da fazenda. E sabem que nunca se
violará a percentagem.
O ajuste de contas faz-se no fim do inverno e realiza-se, ordinariamente, sem que esteja presente a parte
mais interessada. É formalidade dispensável. O vaqueiro separa escrupulosamente a grande maioria de novas
cabeças pertencentes ao patrão (nas quais imprime o sinal da fazenda) das poucas, um quarto, que lhe couberam
por sorte. Grava nestas o seu sinal particular; e conserva-as ou vende-as. Escreve ao patrão, dando-lhe conta
minuciosa de todo o movimento do sítio, alongando-se aos mínimos pormenores; e continua na faina
ininterrupta.
Esta, ainda que, em dadas ocasiões, fatigante, é a mais rudimentar possível. Não existe no Norte uma
indústria pastoril. O gado vive e multiplica-se à gandaia. Ferrados em junho, os garrotes novos perdem-se nas
caatingas, com o resto das malhadas. Ali os rareiam epizootias intensas, em que se sobrelevam o ""rengue"" e o
""mal triste"". Os vaqueiros mal procuram atenuá-las. Restinguem a atividade às corridas desabaladas pelos
arrastadores. Se a bicheira devasta a tropa, sabem de específico mais eficaz que o mercúrio: a reza. Não precisam
de ver o animal doente. Voltam-se apenas na direção em que ele se acha e rezam, tracejando no chão
inextricáveis linhas cabalísticas. Ou então, o que é ainda mais transcendente, curam-no pelo rastro.
E assim passam numa agitação estéril.
Raro, um incidente, uma variante alegre, quebra a sua vida monótona.
Solidários todos, auxiliam-se incondicionalmente em todas as conjunturas. Se foge a algum boi levantadiço,
toma da ""guiada"", põe pernas ao campeão. e ei-lo escanchado no rastro, jogado pelas veredas tiradas a facão. Se
não pode levar avante a empresa, ""pede campo"", frase característica daquela cavalaria rústica, aos companheiros
mais vizinhos, e lá seguem todos, aos dez, aos vinte, rápidos, ruidosos, amigos — ""campeando"", voando pelos
tombadores e esquadrinhando as caatingas até que o bruto, ""desautorizado"" dê a venta no termo da corrida, ou
tombe, de rijo, mancornado às mãos possantes que se lhe aferram aos chifres.
A vaquejada
Esta solidariedade de esforços evidencia-se melhor na ""vaquejada"", trabalho consistindo essencialmente no
reunir, e discriminar depois, os gados de diferentes fazendas convizinhas, que por ali vivem em comum, de
mistura, em um compáscuo único e enorme, sem cercas e sem valos.
Realizam-na de junho a julho.
Escolhido um lugar mais ou menos central, as mais das vezes uma várzea complanada e limpa, o
""rodeador"", congrega-se a vaqueirama das vizinhanças. Concertam nos dispositivos da empresa. Distribuem-se as funções que a cada um caberão na lide. E para logo, irradiantes pela superfície da arena, arremetem com as
caatingas que a envolvem os encourados atléticos.
O quadro tem a movimentação selvagem e assombrosa de uma corrida de tártaros.
Desaparecem em minutos os sertanejos, perdendo-se no matagal circundante. O rodeio permanece por
algum tempo deserto. . .
De repente estruge ao lado um estrídulo tropel de cascos sobre pedras, um estrépido de galhos estalando,
um estalar de chifres embatendo; tufa nos ares, em novelos, uma nuvem de pó; rompe, a súbitas, na clareira,
embolada, uma ponta de gado; e, logo após, sobre o cavalo que estaca esbarrado, o vaqueiro, teso nos estribos...
Traz apenas exígua parte do rebanho. Entrega-a aos companheiros que ali ficam, `'de esteira""; e volve em
galope desabalado, renovando a pesquisa. Enquanto outros repontam além, mais outros, sucessivamente, por
toda a banda, por todo o âmbito do rodeio, que se anima, e tumultua em disparos: bois às marradas ou
escarvando o chão, cavalos curveteando, confundidos e embaralhados sobre os plainos vibrantes num
prolongado rumor de terremoto. Aos lados, na caatinga, os menos felizes se agitam às voltas com os marruás
recalcitrantes. O touro largado ou o garrote vadio em geral refoge à revista. Afunda na caatinga. Segue-o o
vaqueiro. Cose-se-lhe no rastro. Vai com ele às últimas bibocas. Não o larga; até que surja o ensejo para um ato
decisivo: alcançar repentinamente o fugitivo, de arranco; cair logo para o lado da sela, suspenso num estribo e
uma das mãos presa às crinas do cavalo; agarrar com a outra a cauda do boi em disparada e com um rapelão
fortíssimo, de banda, derribá-lo pesadamente em terra... Põe-lhe depois a pela ou a máscara de couro, levando-o
jugulado ou vendado para o rodeador.
Ali o recebem ruidosamente os companheiros. Conta-lhes a façanha. Contam-lhe outras idênticas, e
trocam-se as impressões heróicas numa adjetivação ad boc, que vai num crescendo do ""destalado"" ríspido ao
""temero"" pronunciado num trêmulo enrouquecido e longo.
Depois, ao findar do dia, a última tarefa: contam as cabeças reunidas. Apartam-nas. Separam-se, seguindo
cada um para sua fazenda tangendo por diante as reses respectivas. E pelos ermos ecoam melancolicamente as
notas do ""aboiado"" . . .
A arribada
Segue a boiada vagarosamente, à cadência daquele canto triste e preguiçoso. Escanchado,
desgraciosamente, na sela, o vaqueiro, que a revê unida e acrescida de novas crias, rumina os lucros prováveis: o
que toca ao patrão, e o que lhe toca a ele, pelo trato feito. Vai dali mesmo contando as peças destinadas à feira;
considera, aqui, um velho boi que ele conhece há dez anos e nunca levou à feira, mercê de uma amizade antiga;
além, um mumbica claudicante, em cujo flanco se enterra estrepe agudo, que é preciso arrancar; mais longe,
mascarado, cabeça alta e desafiadora, seguindo apenas guiado pela compressão dos outros, o garrote bravo, que
subjugou, pegando-o ""de saia"", e derrubando-o, na caatinga; acolá, soberbo, caminhando folgado, porque os
demais o respeitam, abrindo-lhe em roda um claro, largo pescoço, envergadura de búfalo, o touro vigoroso,
inveja de toda a redondeza, cujas armas regidas e curtas relembram, estaladas, rombas e cheias de terra,
guampaços formidáveis, em luta com os rivais possantes, nos logradouros; além, para toda a banda, outras peças,
conhecidas todas, revivendo-lhe todas, uma a uma, um incidente, um pormenor qualquer da sua existência
primitiva e simples.
E prosseguem, em ordem, lentos, ao toar merencório da cantiga, que parece acalentá-los, embalando-os com
o refrão monótono:
E cou mansão
E cou...è caõ...
ecoando saudoso nos descampados mudos...
Estouro da boiada
De súbito, porém, ondula um frêmito sulcando, num estremeção repentino, aqueles centenares de dorsos
luzidios. Há uma parada instantânea .Entrebatem-se, enredam-se, trançam-se e alteiam-se fisgando vivamente o
espaço, e inclinam-se, embaralham-se milhares ele chifres. Vibra uma trepidação no solo; e a boiada estoura. . .
A boiada arranca.
Nada explica, às vezes, o acontecimento, aliás vulgar, que é o desespero dos campeiros.
Origina o incidente mais trivial — o súbito vôo rasteiro de uma araquã ou a corrida de um mocó esquivo. Uma
rês se espanta e o contágio, uma descarga nervosa subitânea, transfunde o espanto sobre o rebanho inteiro. É um
solavanco único, assombroso, atirando, de pancada, por diante, revoltos, misturando-os embolados, em
vertiginosos disparos, aqueles maciços corpos tão normalmente tardos e morosos.
E lá se vão: não há mais contê-los ou alcançá-los. Acamam-se as caatingas, árvores dobradas, partidas,
estalando em lascas e gravetos; desbordam de repente as baixadas num marulho de chifres; estrepitam, britando e
esfarelando as pedras, torrentes de cascos pelos tombadores; rola surdamente pelos tabuleiros ruído soturno e
longo de trovão longínquo...
Destroem-se em minutos, feito montes de leivas, antigas roças penosamente cultivadas; extinguem-se, em
lameiros revolvidos, as ipueiras rasas; abatem-se, apisoados, os pousos; ou esvaziam-se, deixando-os os
habitantes espavoridos, fugindo para os lados, evitando o rumo retilíneo em que se despenha a ""arribada"" —
milhares de corpos que são um corpo único, monstruoso, informe, indescritível, de animal fantástico, precipitado
na carreira doida. E sobre este tumulto, arrodeando-o, ou arremessando-se impetuoso na esteira de destroços, que
deixa após si aquela avalancha viva, largado numa disparada estupenda sobre barrancas, e valos, e cerros, e
galhadas — enristado o ferrão, rédeas soltas, soltos os estribos, estirado sobre o lombilho, preso às crinas do
cavalo — o vaqueiro !
Já se lhe tem associado, em caminho, os companheiros, que escutaram, de longe, o estouro da boiada.
Renova-se a lida: novos esforços, novos arremessos, novas façanhas, novos riscos e novos perigos a despender, a
atravessar e a vencer, até que o boiadão, não já pelo trabalho dos que o encalçam e rebatem pelos flancos senão
pelo cansaço, a pouco e pouco afrouxe e estaque, inteiramente abombado.
Reaviam-no à vereda da fazenda; e ressoam, de novo, pelos ermos, entristecedoramente. as notas melancólicas
do aboiado.
Tradições
Volvem os vaqueiros ao pouso e ali, nas redes bamboantes, relatando as peripécias da vaquejada ou famosas
aventuras de feira, passam as horas matando, na significação completa do termo, o tempo, e desalterando-se com
a umbuzada saborosíssima, ou merendando a iguaria incomparável de jerimum com leite.
Se a quadra é propícia, e vão bem as plantações da vazante, e viça o ""panasco"" e o ""mimoso"" nas soltas
dilatadas, e nada revela o aparecimento da seca, refinam a ociosidade nos braços da preguiça benfazeja. Seguem
para as vilas se por lá se fazem festas de cavalhadas e mouramas, divertimentos anacrônicos que os povoados
sertanejos reproduzem, intactos, com os mesmos programas de há três séculos. E entre eles a exótica
""encamisada"", que é o mais curioso exemplo do aferro às mais remotas tradições. Velhíssima cópia das vetustas
quadras dos fossados ou arrancadas noturnas, na Península, contra os castelos árabes, e de todo esquecido na
terra onde nasceu, onde a sua mesma significação é hoje inusitado arcaísmo, esta diversão dispendiosa e
interessante, feita à luz de lanternas e archotes, com os seus longos cortejos de homens a pé, vestidos de branco,
ou à maneira de muçulmanos, e outros a cavalo em animais estranhamente ajaezados, desfilando rápidos, em
escaramuças e simulados recontros, é o encanto máximo dos matutos folgazãos.
Danças
Nem todos, porém, a compartem. Baldos de recursos para se alongarem das rancharias, agitam-se, então,
nos folguedos costumeiros. Encourados de novo, seguem para os sambas e cateretês ruidosos, os solteiros,
famanazes no 'desafio, sobraçando os machetes, que vibram no ""choradinho"" ou ""baião"", e os casados levando
toda a ""obrigação"", a família. Nas choupanas em festa recebem-se os convivas com estrepitosas salvas de
ronqueiras e como em geral não há espaço para tantos, arma-se fora, no terreiro varrido, revestido de ramagens,
mobiliado de cepos e troncos, e raros tamboretes, mas imenso, alumiado pelo luar e pelas estrelas! o salão de
baile. ""Despontam o dia"" com uns largos traços de aguardente, a ""teimosa"". E rompem estrídulamente os
sapateados vivos.
Um cabra destalado ralha na viola. Serenam, em vagarosos meneios, as caboclas bonitas. Revoluteia,,
""brabo e corado"", o sertanejo moço.
Desafios
Nos intervalos travam-se os desafios.
Enterreiram-se, adversários, dois cantores rudes. As rimas saltam e casam-se em quadras muita vez
belíssimas.
Nas horas de Deus, amém,
Não é zombaria, não!
Desafio o mundo inteiro
Pra cantar nesta função !
O adversário retruca logo, levantando-lhe o último verso da quadra:
Pra cantar nesta função,
Amigo, meu camarada,
Aceita teu desafio
O ""fama"" deste sertão!
É o começo da luta que só termina quando um dos bardos se engasga numa rima difícil e titubeia,
repinicando nervosamente o machete, sob uma avalancha de risos saudando-lhe a derrota. E a noite vai
deslizando rápida no folguedo que se generaliza, até que as barras venham quebrando e cantem as sericóias nas
ipueiras, dando o sinal de debandar ao agrupamento folgazão.
Terminada a festa volvem os vaqueiros à tarefa ou à rede preguiçosa.
Alguns, de ano em ano, arrancam dos pousos tranquilos para remotas paragens. Transpõem o S. Francisco;
mergulham nos gerais enormes do ocidente, vastos planaltos indefinidos em que se confundem as bacias daquele
e do Tocantins em alagados de onde partem os rios indiferentemente para o levante e para o poente; e penetram
em Goiás, ou, avantajando-se mais para o norte, as serras do Piauí.
Vão à compra de gados. Aqueles lugares longínquos, pobres e obscuros vilarejos que o Porto Nacional
extrema, animam-se, então, passageiramente, com a romaria dos ""baianos"" São os autocratas das feiras. Dentro
da armadura de couro, galhardos, brandindo a guiada, sobre os cavalos ariscos, entram naqueles vilarejos com
um desgarre atrevido de triunfadores felizes. E ao tornarem — quando não se perdem para todo o sempre, sem
tino, na ""travessia"" perigosa dos descampados uniformes — reatam a mesma vida monótona e primitiva.
A seca
De repente, uma variante trágica.
Aproxima-se a seca.
O sertanejo adivinha-a e graças ao ritmo singular com que se desencadeia o flagelo.
Entretanto não foge logo, abandonando a terra a pouco e pouco invadida pelo limbo candente que irradia do
Ceará.
Buckle, em página notável, assinala a anomalia de se não afeiçoar nunca, o homem, às calamidades naturais
que o rodeiam. Nenhum povo tem mais pavor aos terremotos que o peruano; e no Peru as crianças ao nascerem
tem o berço embalado pelas vibrações da terra.
Mas o nosso sertanejo faz exceção à regra. A seca não o apavora. É um complemento à sua vida tormentosa,
emoldurando-a em cenários tremendos. Enfrenta-a, estóico. Apesar das dolorosas tradições que conhece através
de um sem numero de terríveis episódios, alimenta a todo o transe esperanças de uma resistência impossível.
Com os escassos recursos das próprias observações e das dos seus maiores, em que ensinamentos práticos
se misturam a extravagantes crendices, tem procurado estudar o mal, para o conhecer, suportar e suplantar.
Aparelha-se com singular serenidade para a luta. Dois ou três meses antes do solstício de verão, especa e
fortalece os muros dos açudes, ou limpa as cacimbas. Faz os roçados e arregoa as estreitas faixas de solo arável à
orla dos ribeirões. Está preparado para as plantações ligeiras à vinda das primeiras chuvas.
Procura em seguida desvendar o futuro. Volve o olhar para as alturas; atenta longamente nos quadrantes; e
perquire os traços mais fugitivos das paisagens.
Os sintomas do flagelo despontam-lhe, então, encadeados em série, sucedendo-se inflexíveis, como sinais
comemorativos de uma moléstia cíclica, da sezão assombradora da Terra. Passam as ""chuvas do caju"" em
outubro, rápidas, em chuvisqueiros prestes delidos nos ares ardentes, sem deixarem traços; e ""pintam"" as
caatingas, aqui, ali, por toda a parte, mosqueadas de tufos pardos de árvores marcescentes, cada vez mais
numerosos e maiores, lembrando cinzeiros de uma combustão abafada, sem chamas; e greta-se o chão; e
abaixa-se vagarosamente o nível das cacimbas... Do mesmo passo nota que os dias, estuando logo ao alvorecer,
transcorrem abrasantes, à medida que as noites se vão tornando cada vez mais frias. A atmosfera absorve-lhe,
com avidez de esponja, o suor na fronte, enquanto a armadura de couro, sem mais a flexibilidade primitiva, se
lhe endurece aos ombros, esturrada, rígida, feito uma couraça de bronze. E ao descer das tardes, dia a dia
menores e sem crepúsculos, considera, entristecido, nos ares, em bandos, as primeiras aves emigrantes,
transvoando a outros climas.
É o prelúdio da sua desgraça.
Vê-o acentuar-se num crescendo, até dezembro.
Precautela-se: revista, apreensivo, as malhadas. Percorre os logradouros longos. Procura entre as chapadas
que se esterilizam várzeas mais benignas para onde tange os rebanhos. E espera, resignado, o dia 13 daquele mês
Porque, em tal data, usança avoenga lhe faculta sondar o futuro, interrogando a Providência.
E a experiência tradicional de Santa Luzia. No dia 12 ao anoitecer expõe ao relento, em linha, seis
pedrinhas de sal, que representam, em ordem sucessiva da esquerda para a direita, os seis meses vindouros, de
janeiro a junho. Ao alvorecer de 13 observa-as: se estão intactas, pressagiam a seca; se a primeira apenas se
deliu, transmudada em aljôfar límpido, é certa a chuva em janeiro; se a segunda, em fevereiro; se a maioria ou
todas, é inevitável o inverno benfazejo.
Esta experiência é belíssima. Em que pese ao estigma supersticioso, tem base positiva, e é aceitável desde
que se considera que dela se colhe a maior ou menor dosagem de vapor d'água nos ares, e, dedutivamente,
maiores ou menores probabilidades de depressões barométricas, capazes de atrair o afluxo das chuvas.
Entretanto, embora tradicional, esta prova deixa ainda vacilante o sertanejo. Nem sempre desanima, ante os
seus piores vaticínios. Aguarda, paciente, o equinócio da primavera, para definitiva consulta aos elementos.
Atravessa três longos meses de expectativa ansiosa e no dia de S. José, 19 de março, procura novo augúrio, o
último.
Aquele dia é para ele o índice dos meses subseqüentes. Retrata-lhe, abreviadas em doze horas, todas as
alternativas climáticas vindouras. Se durante ele chove, será chuvoso o inverno: se, ao contrário, o Sol atravessa
abrasadoramente o firmamento claro, estão por terra todas as suas esperanças.
A seca é inevitável.
Insulamento no deserto
Então se transfigura. Não é mais o indolente incorrigível ou o impulsivo violento, vivendo às disparadas
pelos arrastadores. Transcende a sua situação rudimentar. Resignado e tenaz, com a placabilidade superior dos
fortes, encara de fito a fatalidade incoercível; e reage. O heroísmo tem nos sertões, para todo o sempre perdidas,
tragédias espantosas. Não há revivê-las ou episodiá-las. Surgem de uma luta que ninguém descreve — a
insurreição da terra contra o homem. A princípio este reza, olhos postos na altura. O seu primeiro amparo é a fé
religiosa. Sobraçando os santos milagreiros, cruzes alçadas, andores erguidos, bandeiras do Divino ruflando, lá
se vão, descampados em fora, famílias inteiras — não já os fortes e sadios senão os próprios velhos combalidos e
enfermos claudicantes, carregando aos ombros e à cabeça as pedras dos caminhos, mudando os santos de uns
para outros lugares. Ecoam largos dias, monótonas, pelos ermos, por onde passam as lentas procissões
propiciatórias, as ladainhas tristes. Rebrilham longas noites nas chapadas, pervagantes as velas dos penitentes...
Mas os céus persistem sinistramente claros; o Sol fulmina a Terra; progride o espasmo assombrados da seca. O
matuto considera a prole apavorada; contempla entristecido os bois sucumbidos, que se agrupam sobre as
fundagens das ipueiras, ou, ao longe, em grupos erradios e lentos, pescoços dobrados, acaroados com o chão, em
mugidos prantivos “farejando a água""; — e sem que se lhe amorteça a crença, sem duvidar da Providência que o
esmaga, murmurando às mesmas horas as preces costumeiras, apresta-se ao sacrifício. Arremete de alvião a
enxada com a terra, buscando nos estratos inferiores a água que fugiu da superfície. Atinge-os às vezes; outras,
após enormes fadigas, esbarra em uma lajem que lhe anula todo o esforço despendido; e outras vezes, o que é
mais corrente, depois de desvendar tênue lençol líquido subterrâneo, o vê desaparecer um, dois dias passados,
evaporando-se, ou sugado pelo solo. Acompanha-o tenazmente, reprofundando a mina, em cata do tesouro
fugitivo. Volve, por fim, exausto, à beira da própria cova que abriu, feito um desenterrado. Mas como
frugalidade rara lhe permite passar os dias com alguns manelos de paçoca, não se lhe afrouxa, tão de pronto, o
ânimo.
Ali está, em torno, a caatinga, o seu celeiro agreste. Esquadrinha-o. Talha em pedaços os mandacarus que
desalteram, ou as ramas verdoengas dos juazeiros que alimentam os magros bois famintos; derruba os estipites
dos ouricuris e rala-os, amassa-os, cozinha-os, fazendo um pão sinistro, o ""bró"", que incha os ventres num
enfarte ilusório, empanzinando o faminto; atesta os jiraus de coquilhos; arranca as raízes túmidas dos
umbuzeiros, que lhe dessedentam os filhos, reservando para si o sumo adstringente dos cladódios do xiquexique,
que enrouquece ou extinguem a voz de quem o bebe, e demasia-se em trabalhos, apelando infatigável para todos
os recursos — forte e carinhoso — defendendo-se e estendendo à prole abatida e aos rebanhos confiados a
energia sobre-humana.
Baldam-se-lhe, porém, os esforços.
A natureza não o combate apenas com o deserto. Povoa-a, contrastando com a fuga das seriemas, que
emigram para outros ""tabuleiros"", e jandaias, que fogem para o litoral remoto, uma fauna cruel. Miríades de
morcegos agravam a ""magrém"", abatendo-se sobre o gado, dizimando-o. Chocalham as cascavéis, inúmeras,
tanto mais numerosas quanto mais ardente o estio, entre as macegas recrestadas.
À noite, a suçuarana traiçoeira e ladra, que lhe rouba os bezerros e os novilhos, vem beirar a sua lancharia
pobre.
É mais um inimigo a suplantar.
Afugenta-a e espanta-a, precipitando-se com um tição aceso no terreiro deserto. E se ela não recua,
assalta-a. Mas não a tiro, porque sabe que, desviada a mira, ou pouco eficaz o chumbo, a onça, ""vindo em cima
da fumaça"", é invencível.
O pugilato é mais comovente. O atleta enfraquecido, tendo à mão esquerda a forquilha e à direita a faca,
irrita e desafia a fera, provoca-lhe o bote e apara-a no ar, trespassando-a de um golpe.
Nem sempre, porém, pode aventurar-se à façanha arriscada. Uma moléstia extravagante completa a sua
desdita — a hemeralopia. Esta falsa cegueira é paradoxalmente feita pelas reações da luz; nasce dos dias claros e
quentes, dos firmamentos fulgurantes, do vivo ondular dos ares em fogo sobre a terra nua. É uma pletora do
olhar. Mas o Sol se esconde no poente a vítima nada mais vê. Está cega. A noite afoga-se de súbito, antes de
envolver a Terra. E na manhã seguinte a vista extinta lhe revive, acendendo-se no primeiro lampejo do levante,
para se apagar, de novo, à tarde, com intermitência dolorosa.
Renasce-lhe com ela a energia. Ainda se não considera vencido. Restam-lhe, para desalterar e sustentar os
filhos, os talos tenros, os mangarás das bromélias selvagens. Ilude-os com essas iguarias bárbaras.
Segue, a pé agora, porque se Ihe parte o coração só de olhar para o cavalo, para os logradouros. Contempla
ali a ruína da fazenda: bois espectrais, vivos não se sabe como, caídos sob as árvores mortas, mal soerguendo o
arcabouço murcho sobre as pernas secas, marchando vagarosamente, cambaleantes; bois mortos há dias e
intactos, que os próprios urubus rejeitam, porque não rompem a bicadas as suas peles esturradas; bois jururus,
em roda da clareira de chão entorroado onde foi a aguada predileta; e, o que mais Ihe dói, os que ainda não de
todo exaustos o procuram, e o circundam, confiantes, urrando em longo apelo triste que parece um choro.
E nem um cereus avulta mais em torno; foram ruminadas as últimas ramas verdes dos juás...
Trançam-se, porém, ao lado, impenetráveis renques de macambiras. É ainda um recurso. Incendeia-os,
batendo o isqueiro nas acendalhas das folhas ressequidas para os despir, em combustão rápida, dos espinhos. E
quando os rolos de fumo se enovelam e se diluem no ar puríssimo, vêem-se, correndo de todos os lados, em
tropel moroso de estropeados, os magros bois famintos, em busca do último repasto.
Por fim tudo se esgota e a situação não muda. Não há probabilidade sequer de chuvas. A casca das
marizeiras não transuda, prenunciando-as. O nordeste persiste intenso, rolando, pelas chapadas, zunindo em
prolongações uivadas na galhada estrepitante das caatingas e o Sol alastra, reverberando no firmamento claro, os
incêndios inextinguíveis da canícula. O sertanejo, assoberbado de reveses, dobra-se afinal.
Passa certo dia, a sua porta, a primeira turma de ""retirantes"". Vê-a, assombrado, atravessar o terreiro, miseranda,
desaparecendo adiante numa nuvem de poeira, na curva do caminho... No outro dia, outra. E outras. É o sertão
que se esvazia.
Não resiste mais. Amatula-se num daqueles bandos, que lá se vão caminho em fora, debruando de ossadas
as veredas, e lá se vai ele no êxodo penosíssimo para a costa, para as serras distantes, para quaisquer lugares
onde o não mate o elemento primordial da vida.
Atinge-os. Salva-se.
Passam-se meses. Acaba-se o flagelo. Ei-lo de volta. Vence-o saudade do sertão. Remigra. E torna feliz,
revigorado, cantando; esquecido de infortúnios, buscando as mesmas horas passageiras da ventura perdidiça e
instável, os mesmos dias longos de transes e provações demoradas.
Religião mestiça
Insulado deste modo no país, que o não conhece, em luta aberta com o meio, que lhe parece haver
estampado na organização e no temperamento a sua rudeza extraordinária, nômade ou mal fixo à terra, o
sertanejo não tem, por bem dizer, ainda capacidade orgânica para se afeiçoar a situação mais alta.
O círculo estreito da atividade remorou-lhe o aperfeiçoamento psíquico. Está na fase religiosa de um
monoteísmo incompreendido, eivado de misticismo extravagante, em que se rebate o fetichismo do índio e do
africano. E o homem primitivo, audacioso e forte, mas ao mesmo tempo crédulo, deixando-se facilmente
arrebatar pelas superstições mais absurdas. Uma análise destas revelaria a fusão de estádios emocionais distintos.
A sua religião é como ele — mestiça.
Resumo dos caracteres físicos e fisiológicos das raças de que surge, sumaria-lhes identicamente as
qualidades morais. E um índice da vida de três povos. E as suas crenças singulares traduzem essa aproximação
violenta de tendências distintas. E desnecessário descrevê-las. As lendas arrepiadoras do caapora travesso e
maldoso, atravessando célere, montado em caititu arisco, as chapadas desertas, nas noites misteriosas de luares
claros; os sacis diabólicos, de barrete vermelho à cabeça, assaltando o viandante retardatário, nas noites aziagas
das sextas-feiras, de parceria com os lobisomens e mulas-sem-cabeça notívagos; todos os mal-assombramentos,
todas as tentações do maldito ou do diabo — este trágico emissário dos rancores celestes em comissão na Terra;
as rezas dirigidas a S. Campeiro, canonizado in partibus, ao qual se acendem velas pelos campos, para que
favoreça a descoberta de objetos perdidos; as benzeduras cabalísticas para curar os animais, para 'amassar"" e
""vender"" sezões; todas as visualidades, todas aparições fantásticas, todas as profecias esdrúxulas de messias
insanos; e as romarias piedosas; e as missões; e as penitências.... todas as manifestações complexas de
religiosidade indefinida são explicáveis.
Fatores históricos da religião mestiça
Não seria difícil caracterizá-las como uma mestiçagem de crenças. Ali estão, francos, o antropismo do
selvagem, o animismo do africano e, o que é mais, o próprio aspecto emocional da raça superior, na época do
descobrimento e da colonização.
Este último é um caso notável de atavismo, na Historia.
Considerando as agitações religiosas do sertão e os evangelizadores e messias singulares, que,
intermitentemente, o atravessam, ascetas mortificados de flagícios, encalçados sempre pelos sequazes
numerosos, que fanatizam, que arrastam, que dominam, que endoidecem — espontaneamente recordamos a fase
mais crítica da alma portuguesa, a partir do final do século 16, quando, depois de haver por momentos
centralizado a História, o mais interessante dos povos caiu, de súbito, em decomposição rápida, mal disfarçada
pela corte oriental de d. Manuel.
O povoamento do Brasil fez-se, intenso, com d. João III, precisamente no fastígio de completo desequilíbrio
moral, quando ""todos os terrores da Idade Média tinham cristalizado no catolicismo peninsular"".
Uma grande herança de abusões extravagantes, extinta na orla marítima pelo influxo modificador de outras
crenças e de outras raças, no sertão ficou intacta. Trouxeram-na as gentes impressionáveis, que afluíram para a
nossa terra, depois de desfeito no Oriente o sonho miraculoso da Índia. Vinham cheias daquele misticismo feroz,
em que o fervor religioso reverberava à cadência forte das fogueiras inquisitoriais, lavrando intensas na
península. Eram parcelas do mesmo povo que em Lisboa, sob a obsessão dolorosa dos milagres e assaltado de
súbitas alucinações, via, sobre o paço dos reis, ataúdes agoureiros, línguas de flamas misteriosas, catervas de
mouros de albornozes brancos, passando processionalmente; combates de paladinos nas alturas... E da mesma
gente que após Alcácer-Quibir, em plena ""caquexia nacional"", segundo o dizer vigoroso de Oliveira Martins,
procurava, ante a ruína iminente, como salvação única, a fórmula superior das esperanças messiânicas.
De feito, considerando as desordens sertanejas, hoje, e os messias insanos que as provocam,
irresistivelmente nos assaltam, empolgantes' as figuras dos profetas peninsulares de outrora—o rei de
Penamacor, o rei da Ericeira, errantes pelas faldas das serras, devotados ao martírio, arrebatando na mesma
idealização, na mesma insânia, no mesmo sonho doentio, as multidões crendeiras.
Esta justaposição histórica calca-se sobre três séculos. Mas é exata, completa, sem dobras. Imóvel o tempo
sobre a rústica sociedade sertaneja, despeada do movimento geral da evolução humana, ela respira ainda na
mesma atmosfera moral dos iluminados que encalçavam, doidos, o Miguelinho ou o Bandarra. Nem lhe falta,
para completar o símile, o misticismo político do sebastianismo. Extinto em Portugal, ele persiste todo, hoje, de
modo singularmente impressionador, nos sertões do Norte.
Mas não antecipemos.
Caráter variável da religiosidade
sertaneja
Estes estigmas atávicos tiveram entre nós, favoráveis, as reações do meio, determinando psicologia
especial.
O homem dos sertões — pelo que esboçamos — mais do que qualquer outro, está em função imediata da
terra. É uma variável dependente no jogar dos elementos. Da consciência da fraqueza para os debelar resulta,
mais forte, este apelar constante para o maravilhoso, esta condição inferior de pupilo estúpido da divindade. Em
paragens mais benéficas a necessidade de uma tutela sobrenatural não seria tão imperiosa. Ali, porém, as
tendências pessoais como que se acolchetam às vicissitudes externas, e deste entrelaçamento resulta, copiando o
contraste que observamos entre a exaltação impulsiva e a apatia enervadora da atividade, a indiferença fatalista
pelo futuro e a exaltação religiosa. Os ensinamentos dos missionários não poderiam exercitar-se estremes das
tendências gerais da sua época. Por isto, como um palimpsesto, a consciência imperfeita dos matutos revela nas
quadras agitadas, rompendo dentre os ideais belíssimos do catolicismo incompreendido, todos os estigmas de
estádio inferior.
É que, mesmo em períodos normais, a sua religião é indefinida e vária. Da mesma forma que os negros
Haúças, adaptando à liturgia todo o ritual iorubano, realizam o fato anômalo, mas vulgar mesmo na capital da
Bahia, de seguirem para as solenidades da Igreja por ordem dos fetiches, os sertanejos, herdeiros infelizes de
vícios seculares, saem das missas consagradas para os ágapes selvagens dos candomblés africanos ou poracês do
tupi. Não espanta que patenteiem, na religiosidade indefinida, antinomias surpreendentes.
Quem vê a família sertaneja, ao cair da noite, ante o oratório tosco ou registro paupérrimo, à meia luz das
candeias de azeite, orando pelas almas dos mortos queridos, ou procurando alentos à vida tormentosa,
encanta-se.
O culto dos mortos é impressionador. Nos lugares remotos, longe dos povoados, inumam-nos à beira das
estradas, para que não fiquem de todo em abandono, para que os rodeiem sempre as preces dos viandantes, para
que nos ângulos da cruz deponham estes, sempre, uma flor, um ramo, uma recordação fugaz mas renovada
sempre. E o vaqueiro, que segue arrebatadamente, estaca, prestes, o cavalo, ante o humilde monumento — uma
cruz sobre pedras arrumadas — e, a cabeça descoberta, passa vagaroso, rezando pela salvação de quem ele nunca
viu talvez, talvez de um inimigo.
A terra é o exílio insuportável, o morto um bem -aventurado sempre.
O falecimento de uma criança é um dia de festa. Ressoam as violas na cabana dos pobres pais, jubilosos
entre as lágrimas; referve o samba turbulento; vibram nos ares, fortes, as coplas dos desafios; enquanto, a uma
banda, entre duas velas de carnaúba, coroado de flores, o anjinho exposto espelha, no último sorriso paralisado, a
felicidade suprema da volta para os céus, para a felicidade eterna — que é a preocupação dominadora daquelas
almas ingênuas e primitivas.
No entanto há traços repulsivos no quadro desta religiosidade de aspectos tão interessantes, aberrações
brutais, que a derrancam ou maculam.
A ""Pedra Bonita""
As agitações sertanejas, do Maranhão à Bahia, não tiveram ainda um historiador. Não as esboçaremos
sequer. Tomemos um fato, entre muitos, ao acaso.
No termo de Pajeú, em Pernambuco, os últimos rebentos das formações graníticas da costa se alteiam, em
formas caprichosas, na serra Talhada, dominando, majestosos, toda a região em torno e convergindo em largo
anfiteatro acessível apenas por estreita garganta, entre muralhas a pique. No âmbito daquele, como púlpito
gigantesco, ergue-se um bloco solitário — a Pedra Bonita.
Este lugar foi, em 1837, teatro de cenas que recordam as sinistras solenidades religiosas dos Achantis. Um
mamaluco ou cafuz, um iluminado, ali congregou toda a população dos sítios convizinhos e, engrimpando-se à
pedra, anunciava, convicto, o próximo advento do reino encantado do rei d. Sebastião. Quebrada a pedra, a que
subira, não a pancadas de marreta, mas pela ação miraculosa do sangue das crianças, esparzido sobre ela em
holocausto, o grande rei irromperia envolto de sua guarda fulgurante, castigando, inexorável, a humanidade
ingrata, mas cumulando de riquezas os que houvessem contribuído para o desencanto.
Passou pelo sertão um frêmito de necrose...
O transviado encontrara meio propício ao contágio da sua insânia. Em torno da ara monstruosa
comprimiam-se as mães erguendo os filhos pequeninos e lutavam, procurando-lhes a primazia no sacrifício... O
sangue espadanava sobre a rocha jorrando, acumulando-se em torno; e, afirmam os jornais do tempo, em copia
tal que, depois de desfeita aquela lúgubre farsa, era impossível a permanência no lugar infeccionado.
Por outro lado, fatos igualmente impressionadores contrabatem tais aberrações. A alma de um matuto é
inerte ante as influências que a agitam. De acordo com estas pode ir da extrema brutalidade ao máximo
devotamento.
Vimo-la, neste instante, pervertida pelo fanatismo. Vejamo-la transfigurada pela fé.
Monte Santo
Monte Santo é um lugar lendário.
Quando, no século 17, as descobertas das minas determinaram a atração do interior sobre o litoral, os
aventureiros que ao norte investiam com o sertão, demandando as serras da Jacobina, arrebatados pela miragem
das minas de prata e rastreando o itinerário enigmático de Belchior Dias, ali estacionavam longo tempo. A serra
solitária — a Piquaraçá dos roteiros caprichosos — , dominando os horizontes, norteava-lhes a marcha
vacilante.
Além disto, atraía-os por si mesma, irresistivelmente.
É que em um de seus flancos, escritas em caligrafia ciclópica com grandes pedras arrumadas, apareciam
letras singulares — um A, um L e um S — ladeadas por uma cruz, de modo a fazerem crer que estava ali e não
avante, para o ocidente ou para o sul, o el-dorado apetecido.
Esquadrinharam-na, porém, debalde os êmulos do Muribeca astuto, seguindo, afinal, para outros rumos, com as
suas tropas de potiguaras mansos e forasteiros armados de biscainhos . . .
A serra desapareceu outra vez entre as chapadas que domina ...
No fim do século passado, porém, descobriu-a um missionário — Apolônio de Todi. Vindo da missão de
Maçacará, o maior apóstolo do Norte impressionou-se tanto com o aspecto da montanha, ""achando-a semelhante
ao calvário de Jerusalém"", que planeou logo a ereção de uma capela. Ia ser a primeira do mais tosco e do mais
imponente templo da fé religiosa.
Descreve o sacerdote, longamente, o começo e o curso dos trabalhos e o auxílio franco que lhe deram os
povoadores dos lugares próximos. Pinta a última solenidade, procissão majestosa e lenta ascendendo a
montanha, entre as raladas de tufão violento que se alteou das planícies apagando as tochas; e, por fim, o sermão
terminal da penitencia, exortando o povo a ""que nos dias santos viesse visitar os santos lugares, já que vivia em
tão grande desamparo das coisas espirituais"".
""E aqui, termina , sem pensar em mais nada disse que daí em diante não chamariam mais serra de
Piquaraçá, mas sim Monte Santo.""
E fez-se o templo prodigioso, monumento erguido pela natureza e pela fé, mais alto que as mais altas
catedrais da Terra.
A população sertaneja completou a empresa do missionário.
Hoje quem sobe a extensa via-sacra de três quilômetros de comprimento, em que se origem, a espaços, 25
capelas de alvenaria, encerrando painéis dos ""passos"", avalia a constância e a tenacidade do esforço despendido.
Amparada por muros capeados; calçada em certos trechos; tendo, noutros, como leito, a rocha viva talhada
em degraus, ou rampeada, aquela estrada branca, de quartzolito, onde ressoam, há cem anos, as litanias das
procissões da quaresma e têm passado legiões de penitentes, é um prodígio de engenharia rude e audaciosa.
Começa investindo com a montanha, segundo a normal de máximo declive, em rampa de cerca de vinte graus.
Na quarta ou quinta capelinha inflete à esquerda e progride menos íngreme. Adiante, a partir da capela maior —
ermida interessantíssima ereta num ressalto da pedra a cavaleiro do abismo — , volta à direita, diminuindo de
declive até a linha de cumeadas. Segue por esta segundo uma selada breve. Depois se alteia, de improviso,
retilínea, em ladeira forte, arremetendo com o vértice pontiagudo do monte, até o Calvário no alto !
A medida que ascende, ofegante, estacionando nos “passos”, o observador depara perspectivas que seguem
num crescendo de grandezas soberanas: primeiro, os planos das chapadas e tabuleiros, esbatidos embaixo em
planícies vastas; depois, as serranias remotas, agrupadas, longe, em todos os quadrantes; e, atingindo o alto, o
olhar a cavaleiro das serras — o espaço indefinido, a emoção estranha de altura imensa, realçada pelo aspecto da
pequena vila, embaixo, mal percebida na confusão caótica dos telhados.
E quando, pela Semana Santa, convergem ali as famílias da redondeza e passam os crentes pelos mesmos
flancos em que vaguearam outrora, inquietos de ambição, os aventureiros ambiciosos, vê-se que Apolônio de
Todi, mais hábil que o Muribeca, decifrou o segredo das grandes letras de pedra descobrindo o el-dorado
maravilhoso, a mina opulentíssima oculta no deserto...
As missões atuais
Infelizmente o apóstolo não teve continuadores. Salvo raríssimas exceções, o missionário moderno é um
agente prejudicialíssimo no agravar todos os desequilíbrios do estado emocional dos tabaréus. Sem a altitude dos
que o antecederam, a sua ação é negativa: destrói, apaga e perverte o que incutiram de bom naqueles espíritos
ingênuos os ensinamentos dos primeiros evangelizadores, dos quais não tem o talento e não tem a arte
surpreendente da transfiguração das almas. Segue vulgarmente processo inverso do daqueles: não aconselha e
consola, aterra e amaldiçoa; não ora, esbraveja. E brutal e traiçoeiro. Surge das dobras do hábito escuro como da
sombra de uma emboscada armada à credulidade incondicional dos que o escutam. Sobe ao púlpito das igrejas
do sertão e não alevanta a imagem arrebatadora dos céus; descreve o inferno truculento e flamívomo, numa
algaravia de frases rebarbativas a que completam gestos de maluco e esgares de truão.
É ridículo, e é medonho. Tem o privilégio estranho das bufonerias melodramáticas. As parvoíces saem-lhe
da boca trágicas.
Não traça ante os matutos simples a feição honesta e superior da vida — não a conhece; mas brama em
todos os tons contra o pecado; esboça grosseiros quadros de torturas; e espalha sobre o auditório fulminado
avalanchas de penitencias, extravagando largo tempo, em palavrear interminável, fungando as pitadas habituais e
engendrando catástrofes, abrindo alternativamente a caixa de rapé e a boceta de Pandora...
E alucina o sertanejo crédulo; alucina-o, deprime-o, perverte-o.
Os ""Serenos""
Busquemos um exemplo único, o último.
Em 1850 os sertões de Cariri foram alvorotados pelas depredações dos Serenos, exercitando o roubo em
larga escala.
Aquela denominação indicava ""companhias de penitentes"" que à noite, nas encruzilhadas ermas, em torno
das cruzes misteriosas, se agrupavam, adoidadamente, numa agitação macabra de flagelantes, impondo-se o
cilício dos espinhos, das urtigas e outros duros tratos de penitência. Ora, aqueles agitados saíram certo dia,
repentinamente, da matriz do Crato, dispersos, em desalinho — mulheres em prantos, homens apreensivos,
crianças trementes — em procura dos flagícios duramente impostos. Dentro da igreja, missionários recém-vindos
haviam profetizado próximo fim do mundo. Deus o dissera — em mau português, em mau italiano e em mau
latim — estava farto dos desmandos da Terra...
E os derivados foram pelos sertões em fora, esmolando, chorando, rezando, numa mandria deprimente, e como a
caridade pública não os podia satisfazer a todos, acabaram — roubando.
Era fatal. Os instrutores do crime foram, afinal, infelicitar outros lugares e a justiça a custo reprimiu o
banditismo incipiente.
Capítulo IV
Antônio Conselheiro, documento vivo de atavismo
É natural que estas camadas profundas da nossa estratificação étnica se sublevassem numa anticlinal
extraordinária — Antônio Conselheiro...
A imagem é corretíssima.
Da mesma forma que o geólogo, interpretando a inclinação e a orientação dos estratos truncados de antigas
formações, esboça o perfil de uma montanha extinta, o historiador só pode avaliar a altitude daquele homem, que
por si nada valeu, considerando a psicologia da sociedade que o criou. Isolado, ele se perde na turba dos
nevróticos vulgares. Pode ser incluído numa modalidade qualquer de psicose progressiva. Mas, posto em função
do meio, assombra. É uma diátese e é uma síntese. As fases singulares da sua existência não são, talvez, períodos
sucessivos de uma moléstia grave, mas são, com certeza, resumo abreviado dos aspectos predominantes de mal
social gravíssimo. Por isto o infeliz, destinado à solicitude dos médicos, veio, impelido por uma potência
superior, bater de encontro a uma civilização, indo para a História como poderia ter ido para o hospício. Porque
ele para o historiador não foi um desequilibrado. Apareceu como integração de caracteres diferenciais — vagos,
indecisos, mal percebidos quando dispersos na multidão, mas enérgicos e definidos, quando resumidos numa
individualidade.
Todas as crenças ingênuas, do fetichismo bárbaro às aberrações católicas, todas as tendências impulsivas
das raças inferiores, livremente exercitadas na indisciplina da vida sertaneja, se condensaram no seu misticismo
feroz e extravagante. Ele foi, simultaneamente, o elemento ativo e passivo da agitação de que surgiu. O
temperamento mais impressionável apenas fê-lo absorver as crenças ambientes, a princípio numa quase
passividade pela própria receptividade mórbida do espirito torturado de reveses, e elas refluíram, depois, mais
fortemente, sobre o próprio meio de onde haviam partido, partindo da sua consciência delirante.
É difícil traçar no fenômeno a linha divisória entre as tendências pessoais e as tendências coletivas: a vida
resumida do homem é um capítulo instantâneo da vida de sua sociedade...
Acompanhar a primeira é seguir paralelamente e com mais rapidez a segunda: acompanhá-las juntas é
observar a mais completa mutualidade de influxos.
Considerando em torno, o falso apóstolo, que o próprio excesso de subjetivismo predispusera à revolta
contra a ordem natural, como que observou a fórmula do próprio delírio. Não era um incompreendido. A
multidão aclamava-o representante natural das suas aspirações mais altas. Não foi, por isto, além. Não deslizou
para a demência. No gravitar contínuo para o mínimo de uma curva, para o completo obscurecimento da razão, o
meio reagindo por sua vez amparou-o, corrigindo-o, fazendo-o estabelecer encadeamento nunca destruído nas
mais exageradas concepções, certa ordem no próprio desvario, coerência indestrutível em. todos os atos e
disciplina rara em todas as paixões, de sorte que ao atravessar, largos anos, nas práticas ascéticas, o sertão
alvorotado, tinha na atitude, na palavra e no gesto, a tranqüilidade, a altitude e a resignação soberana de um
apóstolo antigo.
Doente grave, só lhe pode ser aplicado o conceito da paranóia, de Tanzi e Riva.
Em seu desvio ideativo vibrou sempre, a bem dizer exclusiva, a nota étnica. Foi um documento raro de
atavismo.
A constituição mórbida levando-o a interpretar caprichosamente as condições objetivas, e alterando-lhe as
relações com o mundo exterior, traduz-se fundamentalmente como uma regressão ao estádio mental dos tipos
ancestrais da espécie.
Um gnóstico bronco
Evitada a intrusão dispensável de um médico, um antropologista encontrá-lo-ia normal, marcando
logicamente certo nível da mentalidade humana, recuando no tempo, fixando uma fase remota da evolução. O
que o primeiro caracterizaria como caso franco de delírio sistematizado, na fase persecutória ou de grandezas, o
segundo indicaria como fenômeno de incompatibilidade com as exigências superiores da civilização — um
anacronismo palmar, a revivescência de atributos psíquicos remotíssimos. Os traços mais típicos do seu
misticismo estranho, mas naturalíssimo para nós, já foram, dentro de nossa era, aspectos religiosos vulgares.
Deixando mesmo de lado o influxo das raças inferiores, vimo-los há pouco, de relance, em período angustioso da
vida portuguesa.
Poderíamos apontá-los em cenário mais amplo. Bastava que volvêssemos aos primeiros dias da Igreja,
quando o gnosticismo universal se erigia como transição obrigatória entre o paganismo e o cristianismo, na
última fase do mundo romano em que, precedendo o assalto dos bárbaros, a literatura latina do ocidente
declinou, de súbito, mal substituída pelos sofistas e letrados tacanhos de Bizâncio.
Com efeito, os montanistas da Frígia, os adamitas infames, os ofiolatras, os maniqueus bifrontes entre o
ideal cristão emergente e o budismo antigo, os discípulos de Markos, os encratitas abstinentes e macerados de
flagícios, todas as seitas em que se fracionava a religião nascente, com os seus doutores histéricos e exegeses
hiperbólicas, forneceriam hoje casos repugnantes de insânia. E foram normais. Acolchetaram-se bem a todas as
tendências da época em que as extravagâncias de Alexandre Abnótico abalavam a Roma de Marco Aurélio, com
as suas procissões fantásticas, os seus mistérios e os seus sacrifícios tremendos de leões lançados vivos ao
Danúbio, com solenidades imponentes presididas pelo imperador filósofo...
A história repete-se.
Antônio Conselheiro foi um gnóstico bronco.
Veremos mais longe a exação do símile.
Grande homem pelo avesso
Paranóico indiferente, este dizer, talvez, mesmo não lhe possa ser ajustado, inteiro. A regressão ideativa que
patenteou, caracterizando-lhe o temperamento vesânico, é, certo, um caso notável de degenerescência intelectual,
mas não o isolou — incompreendido, desequilibrado, retrógrado, rebelde — no meio em que agiu.
Ao contrário, este fortaleceu-o. Era o profeta, o emissário das alturas, transfigurado por ilapso estupendo,
mas adstrito a todas as contingências humanas, passível do sofrimento e da morte, e tendo uma função exclusiva:
apontar aos pecadores o caminho da salvação. Satisfez-se sempre com este papel de delegado dos céus. Não foi
além. Era um servo jungido à tarefa dura; e lá se foi, caminho dos sertões bravios, largo tempo, arrastando a
carcaça claudicante, arrebatado por aquela idéia fixa, mas de algum modo lúcido em todos os atos,
impressionando pela firmeza nunca abalada e seguindo para um objetivo fixo com finalidade irresistível.
A sua frágil consciência oscilava em torno dessa posição média, expressa pela linha ideal que Maudsley
lamenta não se poder traçar entre o bom senso e a insânia.
Parou aí indefinidamente, nas fronteiras oscilantes da loucura, nessa zona mental onde se confundem
facínoras e heróis, reformadores brilhantes e aleijões tacanhos, e se acotovelam gênios e degenerados. Não a
transpôs. Recalcado pela disciplina vigorosa de uma sociedade culta, a sua nevrose explodiria na revolta, o seu
misticismo comprimido esmagaria a razão. Ali, vibrando a primeira uníssona com o sentimento ambiente,
difundido o segundo pelas almas todas que em torno se congregavam, se normalizaram.
Representante natural do meio em que nasceu
O fator sociológico, que cultivara a psicose mística do indivíduo, limitou-a sem a comprimir, numa
harmonia salvadora. De sorte que o espírito predisposto para a rebeldia franca contra a ordem natural cedeu à
única reação de que era passível. Cristalizou num ambiente propício de erros e superstições comuns.
Antecedentes de família. Os Maciéis
A sua biografia compendia e resume a existência da sociedade sertaneja. Esclarece o conceito etiológico da
doença que o vitimou. Delineemo-la de passagem.
""Os Maciéis, que formavam, nos sertões entre Quixeramobim e Tamboril, uma família numerosa de homens
válidos, ágeis, inteligentes e bravos, vivendo de vaqueirice e pequena criação, vieram, pela lei fatal dos tempos, a
fazer parte dos grandes fastos criminais do Ceará, em uma guerra de família. Seus êmulos foram os Araújos, que
formavam uma família rica, filiada a outras das mais antigas do norte da província.
Viviam na mesma região, tendo como sede principal a povoação de Boa Viagem, que demora cerca de dez
léguas de Quixeramobim.
Foi uma das lutas mais sangrentas dos sertões do Ceará, a que se travou entre estes dois grupos de homens,
desiguais na fortuna e posição oficial, ambos embravecidos na prática das violências, e numerosos.""
Assim começa o narrador consciencioso breve notícia sobre a genealogia de Antônio Conselheiro.
Os fatos criminosos a que se refere são um episódio apenas entre as razias, quase permanentes, da vida
turbulenta dos sertões. Copiam mil outros de que ressaltam, evidentes, a prepotência sem freios dos mandões de
aldeia e a exploração pecaminosa por eles exercida sobre a bravura instintiva do sertanejo. Luta de famílias — é
uma variante apenas de tantas outras, que ali surgem, intermináveis, comprometendo as próprias descendências
que esposam as desavenças dos avós, criando uma quase predisposição fisiológica e tornando hereditários os
rancores e as vinganças.
Lutas entre Maciéis e Araújos
Surgiu de incidente mínimo: pretensos roubos cometidos pelos Maciéis em propriedade de família
numerosa, a dos Araújos.
Tudo indicava serem aqueles vítimas de acusação descabida. Eram ""homens vigorosos, simpáticos, bem
apessoados. verdadeiros e serviçais"" gozando em toda a redondeza de reputação invejável.
Araújo da Costa e um seu parente, Silvestre Rodrigues Veras, não viam, porém, com bons olhos, a família
pobre que lhes balanceava a influência, sem a justificativa de vastos latifúndios e boiadas grandes. Criadores
opulentos, senhores de baraço e cutelo, vezados a fazer justiça por si mesmos, concertaram em dar exemplar
castigo aos delinqüentes. E como estes eram bravos até à temeridade, chamaram a postos a guarda pretoriana dos
capangas.
Assim apercebidos abalaram na expedição criminosa para Quixeramobim.
Mas volveram logo depois, contra a expectativa geral, em derrota. Os Maciéis, reunida toda a parentela,
rapazes desempenados e temeros, haviam-se afrontado com a malta assalariada, repelindo-a vigorosamente,
suplantando-a, espavorindo-a.
O fato passou em 1333.
Batidos, mal sofreando o desapontamento e a cólera, os potentados, cuja imbecilidade triunfante passara por
tão duro trato, apelaram para recursos mais enérgicos. Não faltavam então, como não faltam hoje, facínoras de
fama que lhes alugassem a coragem. Conseguiram dois, dos melhores: José Joaquim de Meneses,
pernambucano, sanhudo, célebre pela rivalidade sanguinolenta com os Mourões famosos; e um cangaceiro
terrível, Vicente Lopes, de Aracatiaçu. Reunida a matula turbulenta, a que se ligaram os filhos e genros de
Silvestre, seguiu, de pronto, para a empreitada criminosa.
Ao acercarem-se, porém, da vivenda dos Maciéis, os sicários — embora fossem em maior número —
temeram-lhes a resistência. Propuseram-lhes que se entregassem, garantindo-lhes, sob palavra, a vida. Aqueles,
certos de não poderem resistir por muito tempo, aquiesceram. Renderam-se. A palavra de honra dos bandidos
teve o valor que poderia ter. Quando seguiam debaixo de escolta e algemados, para a cadeia de Sobral, logo no
primeiro dia da viagem foram os presos trucidados. Morreram nesta ocasião, entre outros, o chefe da família,
Antônio Maciel, e um avô de Antônio Conselheiro .
Mas um tio deste, Miguel Carlos, logrou escapar. Manietado além disto com as pernas amarradas por baixo
da barriga do cavalo que montava, a sua fuga é inexplicável. Afirma-a, contudo, a sisudez de cronista sincero.
Ora, os Araújos tinham deixado fugir o seu pior adversário. Perseguiram-no. Bem armados, bem montados,
encalçaram-no, prestes, em monteria bárbara, como se fossem sobre rastros de suçuarana bravia. O foragido,
porém, emérito batedor de matas, seguido na fuga por uma irmã, iludiu por algum tempo a escolta perseguidora
chefiada por Pedro Martins Veras; e no sítio da Passagem, perto de Quixeramobim, ocultou-se exausto, numa
choupana abandonada, coberta de ramos de oiticica.
Ali chegaram, em breve, rastreando-o, os perseguidores. Eram nove horas da manhã. Houve então uma
refrega desigual e tremenda. O temerário sertanejo, embora estropiado e doente de um pé que luxara, afrontou-se
com a horda assaltante, estendendo logo em terra a um certo Teotônio, desordeiro façanhudo, que se avantajara
aos demais. Este caiu transversalmente à soleira da porta, impedindo-a que se fechasse. A irmã de Miguel
Carlos, quando procurava arrastá-lo dali, caiu atravessada por uma bala. Alvejara-a o próprio Pedro Veras, que
pagou logo a façanha, levando à queima-roupa uma carga de chumbo. Morto o cabecilha, os agressores recuaram
por momentos, o suficiente para que o assaltado trancasse rapidamente a porta.
Isto feito, o casebre fez-se um reduto. Pelas frinchas das paredes estourava de minuto em minuto um tiro de
espingarda. Os bandidos não ousaram investi-lo; mas foram de cobardia feroz. Atearam fogo à cobertura de
folhas.
O efeito foi pronto. Mal podendo respirar no abrigo em chamas, Miguel Carlos resolve abandoná-lo.
Derrama toda a água de um pote na direção do fundo da choupana, apagando momentaneamente as brasas, e,
saltando por sobre o cadáver da irmã, arroja-se, de clavina sobraçada e parnaíba em punho, contra o círculo
assaltante. Rompe-o e afunda na caatinga. . .
Tempos depois um dos Araújos contratou casamento com a filha de rico criador de Tapaiara; e no dia das
núpcias, já perto da igreja, tombou varado por uma bala, entre o alarma dos convivas e o desespero da noiva
desditosa.
Velava, inextinguivelmente, a vingança do sertanejo...
Este tinha, agora, uma sócia no rancor justificado e fundo, outra irmã, Helena Maciel, a ""Nêmesis da
família"", conforme o dizer do cronista referido. A sua vida transcorria em lances perigosos, muitos dos quais
desconhecidos senão fabulados pela imaginação fecunda dos matutos. O certo, porém, é que, desfazendo a
urdidura de todas as tocaias, não raro lhe caiu sob a faca o espião incauto que o rastreava, em Quixeramobim.
Diz a narrativa a que acima nos reportamos:
""Parece que Miguel Carlos tinha ali protetores que o garantiam. O que é certo é que, não obstante a sorte
tivera aquele seu apaniguado, costumava estar na vila.
Uma noite, estando à porta da loja de Manuel Procópio de Freitas, viu entrar um indivíduo, que procurava
comprar aguardente. Dando-o como espião, falou em matá-lo ali mesmo, mas, sendo detido pelo dono da casa,
tratou de acompanhar o suspeito, e o matou, à faca, ao sair da vila, no riacho da Palha.
Uma manhã, finalmente, saiu da casa de Antônio Caetano de Oliveira, casado com uma sua parenta, e foi
banhar-se no rio, que corre por trás dessa casa, situada quase no extremo da praça principal da vila, junto a
garganta que conduz a pequena praça Cotovelo. Nos fundos da casa indicada era então a embocadura do riacho
da Palha, que em forma quase circular contornava aquela praça, e de inverno constituía uma cinta lindíssima de
águas represadas. Miguel Carlos estava já despido, como muitos companheiros, quando surgiu um grupo de
inimigos, que o esperavam acocorados por entre o denso ""mata-pasto"". Estranhos e parentes de Miguel Carlos,
tomando as roupas depostas na areia, e vestindo-as ao mesmo tempo que corriam, puseram-se em fuga. Em
ceroulas somente, e com a sua faca em punho, ele correu também na direção dos fundos de uma casa, que quase
enfrenta com a embocadura do riacho da Palha; casa na qual morava em 1845 Manuel Francisco da Costa.
Miguel Carlos chegou a abrir o portão do quintal, de varas, da casa indicada; mas, quando quis fechá-lo, foi
prostrado por um tiro, partido do séquito que o perseguia. Outros dizem que isto se dera quando ele passava pelo
buraco da cerca de uma vazante que havia por ali. Agonizava, caído, com a sua faca na mão, quando Manuel de
Araújo, chefe do bando, irmão do noivo outrora assassinado, pegando-o por uma perna, lhe cravou uma faca.
Moribundo, Miguel Carlos lhe respondeu no mesmo instante com outra facada na carótida, morrendo ambos
instantaneamente, este por baixo daquele ! Helena Maciel, correndo em fúria ao lugar do conflito, pisou a pés a
cara do matador de seu irmão, dizendo-se satisfeita da perda dele pelo fim que dera ao seu inimigo !""
Pretendem que os sicários tinham passado a noite em casa de Inácio Mendes Guerreiro, da família de
Araújo, agente do correio da Vila. Vinham a título de prender os Maciéis; mas, só no propósito de matá-los.
Helena não se abateu com esta desgraça. Nêmesis da família imolou um inimigo aos manes do seu irmão.
Foi ela, como ousou confessar muitos anos depois, quem mandou espancar barbaramente a André Jacinto de
Souza Pimentel, moço de família importante da vila, aparentado com os Araújos, a quem atribuía os avisos que
estes recebiam em Boa Viagem, das vindas de Miguel Carlos. Desse espancamento resultou uma lesão cardíaca,
que fez morrer em transes horrorosos o infeliz, em verdade culpado dessa derradeira agressão dos Araújos.
O fato de ter sido o crime perpetrado por soldados do destacamento de linha, ao mando do alferes Francisco
Gregório Pinto, homem insolente, de baixa educação e origem, com quem Pimentel andava inimizado, fez
acreditar muito tempo que fora esse oficial mal reputado o autor do crime.
Helena deixara-se ficar queda e silenciosa.
Inúmeras vítimas anônimas fez esta lota sertaneja, que dizimava os sequazes das duas famílias, sendo o
último dos Maciéis — Antônio Maciel, irmão de Miguel Carlos, morto em Boa Viagem. Ficou célebre muito
tempo a valentia de Miguel Carlos e era por ele e seus parentes a estima e respeito dos coevos, testemunhas da
energia dessa família, dentre a qual surgiram tantos homens de esforço, para uma luta com poderosos tais, como
os da Boa Viagem e Tamboril.
Uma vida bem auspiciada
Nada se sabe ao certo sobre o papel que coube a Vicente Mendes Maciel, pai de Antônio Vicente Mendes
Maciel ( o Conselheiro ), nesta luta deplorável. Os seus contemporâneos pintam-no como ""homem irascível mas
de excelente caráter, meio visionário e desconfiado, mas de tanta capacidade que, sendo analfabeto, negociava
largamente em fazendas, trazendo tudo perfeitamente contado e medido de memória, sem mesmo ter escrita para
os devedores"".
O filho, sob a disciplina de um pai de honradez proverbial e ríspido, teve educação que de algum modo o
isolou da turbulência da família. Indicam-no testemunhas de vista, ainda existentes, como adolescente tranqüilo e
tímido, sem o entusiasmo feliz dos que seguem as primeiras escalas da vida; retraído, avesso à troça, raro
deixando a casa de negócio do pai, em Quixeramobim, de todo entregue aos misteres de caixeiro consciencioso,
deixando passar e desaparecer vazia a quadra triunfal dos vinte anos. Todas as histórias, ou lendas entretecidas
de exageros, segundo o hábito dos narradores do sertão, em que eram muita vez protagonistas os seus próprios
parentes, eram-lhe entoadas em torno evidenciando-lhes sempre a coragem tradicional e rara. A sugestão das
narrativas, porém, tinha o corretivo enérgico da ríspida sisudez do velho Mendes Maciel e não abalava o animo
do rapaz. Talvez ficasse latente, pronta a se expandir em condições mais favoráveis. O certo é que falecendo
aquele em 1855, vinte anos depois dos trágicos sucessos que rememoramos, Antônio Maciel prosseguiu na
mesma vida corretíssima e calma.
Arrostando com a tarefa de velar por três irmãs solteiras revelou abnegação rara. Somente depois de as ter
casado procurou, por sua vez, um enlace que lhe foi nefasto.
Primeiros reveses
Data daí a sua existência dramática. A mulher foi a sobrecarga adicionada à tremenda tara hereditária, que
desequilibraria uma vida iniciada sob os melhores auspícios.
A partir de 1858 todos os seus atos denotam uma transformação de caráter. Perde os hábitos sedentários.
Incompatibilidades de gênio com a esposa ou, o que é mais verossímil, a péssima índole desta, tornam instável a
sua situação.
Em poucos anos vive em diversas vilas e povoados. Adota diversas profissões.
Nesta agitação, porém, percebe-se a luta de um caráter que se não deixa abater. Tendo ficado sem bens de
fortuna, Antônio Maciel, nesta fase preparatória de sua vida, a despeito das desordens do lar, ao chegar a
qualquer nova sede de residência procura logo um emprego, um meio qualquer honesto de subsistência. Em
1859, mudando-se para Sobral, emprega-se como caixeiro. Demora-se, porém, pouco ali. Segue para Campo
Grande, onde desempenha as funções modestas de escrivão do juiz de paz. Daí, sem grande demora, se desloca
para Ipu. Faz-se solicitador, ou requerente no forum.
Nota-se já em tudo isto um crescendo para profissões menos trabalhosas, exigindo cada vez menos a
constância do esforço; o contínuo despear-se da disciplina primitiva, a tendência acentuada para a atividade mais
irrequieta e mais estéril, o descambar para a vadiagem franca. Ia-se-lhe ao mesmo tempo, na desarmonia do lar, a
antiga serenidade.
Este período de vida mostra-o, todavia, aparelhado de sentimentos dignos. Ali estavam, em torno,
permanentes lutas partidárias abrindo-lhe carreira aventurosa, em que poderia entrar como tantos outros,
ligando-se aos condutícios de qualquer conquistador de urnas, para o que tinha o prestígio tradicional da família.
Evitou-as sempre. E na descensão contínua, percebe-se alguém que perde o terreno, mas lentamente, reagindo,
numa exaustão dolorosa.
A queda
De repente, surge-lhe revés violento. O plano inclinado daquela vida em declive termina, de golpe, em
queda formidável. Foge-lhe a mulher, em Ipu, raptada por um policial. Foi o desfecho. Fulminado de vergonha, o
infeliz procura o recesso dos sertões, paragens desconhecidas, onde lhe não saibam o nome; o abrigo da absoluta
obscuridade.
Desce para o sul do Ceará.
Ao passar em Paus Brancos, na estrada do Crato, fere com ímpeto de alucinado, à noite, um parente, que o
hospedara. Fazem-se breves inquirições policiais, tolhidas logo pela própria vítima reconhecendo a não
culpabilidade do agressor. Salva-se da prisão. Prossegue depois para o sul, à toa, na direção do Crato. E
desaparece...
Passam-se dez anos. O moço infeliz de Quixeramobim ficou de todo esquecido. Apenas uma ou outra vez
lhe recordavam o nome e o termo escandaloso da existência, em que era magna pars um Lovelace de coturno
reúno, um sargento de polícia.
Graças a este incidente, algo ridículo, ficara nas paragens natais breve resquício de sua lembrança.
Morrera por assim dizer.
Como se faz um monstro
... E surgia na Bahia o anacoreta sombrio, cabelos crescidos até aos ombros, barba inculta e longa; face
escaveirada; olhar fulgurante; monstruoso, dentro de um hábito azul de brim americano; abordoado ao clássico
bastão em que se apóia o passo tardo dos peregrinos...
É desconhecida a sua existência durante tão largo período. Um velho caboclo, preso em Canudos nos últimos
dias da campanha, disse-me algo a respeito, mas vagamente, sem precisar datas, sem pormenores característicos.
Conhecera-o nos sertões de Pernambuco, um ou dois anos depois da partida do Crato. Das palavras desta
testemunha, concluí que Antônio Maciel, ainda moço, já impressionava vivamente a imaginação dos sertanejos.
Aparecia por aqueles lugares sem destino fixo, errante. Nada referia sobre o passado. Praticava em frases breves
e raros monossílabos. Andava sem rumo certo, de um pouso para outro, indiferente à vida e aos perigos,
alimentando-se mal e ocasionalmente, dormindo ao relento à beira dos caminhos, numa penitência demorada e
rude...
Tornou-se logo alguma coisa de fantástico ou mal-assombrado para aquelas gentes simples. Ao abeirar-se das
rancharias dos tropeiros aquele velho singular, de pouco mais de trinta anos, fazia que cessassem os improvisos e
as violas festivas.
Era natural. Ele surdia — esquálido e macerado — dentro do hábito escorrido, sem relevos, mudo, como uma
sombra, das chapadas povoadas de duendes...
Passava, buscando outros lugares, deixando absortos os matutos supersticiosos.
Dominava-os, por fim, sem o querer.
No seio de uma sociedade primitiva, que pelas qualidades étnicas e influxo das santas missões malévolas
compreendia melhor a vida pelo incompreendido dos milagres, o seu viver misterioso rodeou-o logo de não
vulgar prestígio, agravando-lhe, talvez, o temperamento delirante. A pouco e pouco todo 0 domínio que, sem
cálculo, derramava em torno, parece haver refluído sobre si mesmo. Todas as conjeturas ou lendas que para logo
o circundaram fizeram o ambiente propício ao germinar do próprio desvario. A sua insânia estava, ali,
exteriorizada. Espelhavam-na a admiração intensa e o respeito absoluto que o tornaram em pouco tempo árbitro
incondicional de todas as divergências ou brigas, conselheiro predileto em todas as decisões. A multidão
poupara-lhe o indagar torturante acerca do próprio estado emotivo, o esforço dessas interrogativas angustiosas e
dessa intuspecção delirante, entre os quais envolve a loucura nos cérebros abalados. Remodelava-o à sua
imagem. Criava-o. Ampliava-lhe, desmesuradamente, a vida, lançando-lhe dentro os erros de 2 mil anos.
Precisava de alguém que lhe traduzisse a idealização indefinida, e a guiasse nas trilhas misteriosas para os céus...
O evangelizador surgiu, monstruoso, mas autômato.
Aquele dominador foi um títere. Agiu passivo, como uma sombra. Mas esta condensava o obscurantismo de três
raças.
E cresceu tanto que se projetou na História...
Peregrinações e martírios
Dos sertões de Pernambuco passou aos de Sergipe, aparecendo na cidade de Itabaiana em 1874.
Ali chegou, como em toda a parte, desconhecido e suspeito, impressionando pelos trajes esquisitos — camisolão
azul, sem cintura; chapéu de abas largas derrubadas, e sandálias. Às costas um surrão de couro em que trazia
papel, pena e tinta, a Missão Abreviada e as Horas Marianas.
Vivia de esmolas, das quais recusava qualquer excesso, pedindo apenas o sustento de cada dia. Procurava os
pousos solitários. Não aceitava leito algum, além de uma tábua nua e, na falta desta, o chão duro.
Assim pervagou largo tempo, até aparecer nos sertões, ao norte da Bahia. Ia-lhe crescendo o prestígio. Já não
seguia só. Encalçavam-no na rota desnorteada os primeiros fiéis. Não os chamara. Chegavam-lhe espontâneos,
felizes por atravessarem com ele os mesmos dias de provações e misérias.
Eram, no geral, gente ínfima e suspeita, avessa ao trabalho, farândula de vencidos da vida, vezada à mandria e à
rapina.
Um dos adeptos carregava o templo único, então, da religião minúscula e nascente: um oratório tosco, de cedro,
encerrando a imagem do Cristo.
Nas paradas pelos caminhos prendiam-no a um galho de árvore; e, genuflexos, rezavam. Entravam com ele,
triunfalmente erguido, pelos vilarejos e povoados, num coro de ladainhas.
Assim se apresentou o Conselheiro, em 1816, na vila do Itapicuru-de-Cima. Já tinha grande renome.
Di-lo documento expressivo publicado aquele ano, na capital do Império.
""Apareceu no sertão do norte um indivíduo, que se diz chamar Antônio Conselheiro, e que exerce grande
influencia no espírito das classes populares servindo-se de seu exterior misterioso e costumes ascéticos, com que
impõe à ignorância e à simplicidade. Deixou crescer a barba e cabelos, veste uma túnica de algodão e
alimenta-se tenuamente, sendo quase uma múmia. Acompanhado de duas professas, vive a rezar terços e
ladainhas e a pregar e a dar conselhos às multidões, que reúne, onde lhe permitem os párocos; e, movendo
sentimentos religiosos, vai arrebanhando o povo e guindo-o a seu gosto. Revela ser homem inteligente, mas sem
cultura"".
Estes dizeres rigorosamente verídicos, de um anuário impresso centenares de léguas de distancia, delatam bem a
fama que ele já granjeara.
Lendas
Entretanto a vila de Itapicuru esteve para ser o fecho da sua carreira extraordinária. Foi, ali, naquele mesmo ano,
entre o espanto dos fiéis, inopinadamente preso. Determinara a prisão uma falsidade, que o seu modo de vida
excepcional e as antigas desordens domésticas de algum modo justificavam: diziam-no assassino da esposa e da
própria mãe.
Era uma lenda arrepiadora.
Contavam que a última, desadorando a nora, imaginara perdê-la. Revelara, por isto, que era traído; e como este,
surpreso, lhe exigisse provas do delito, propôs-se apresentá-las sem tardança. Aconselhou-o a que fantasiasse
qualquer viagem, permanecendo, porém, nos arredores, porque veria, à noite, invadir-lhe o lar o sedutor que o
desonrara. Aceito o alvitre, o infeliz, cavalgando e afastando-se cerca de meia légua, torceu depois de rédeas,
tornando, furtivamente, por desfreqüentados desvios, para uma espera adrede escolhida, de onde pudesse
observar bem e agir de pronto.
Ali quedou longas horas, até lobrigar, de fato, noite velha, um vulto aproximando-se de sua vivenda. Viu-o
achegar-se cautelosamente e galgar uma das janelas. E não lhe deu tempo para entrar. Abateu-o com um tiro.
Penetrou, em seguida, de um salto, no lar e fulminou com outra descarga a esposa infiel, adormecida.
Voltou, depois, para reconhecer o homem que matara... e viu com horror que era a sua própria mãe, que se
disfarçara daquele modo para a consecução do plano diabólico.
Fugira, então, na mesma hora apavorado, doido, abandonando tudo, ao acaso, pelos sertões em fora...
A imaginação popular, como se vê, começava a romancear-lhe a vida, com um traço vigoroso de originalidade
trágica.
O asceta
Como quer que fosse, porém, o certo é que em 1870 a repressão legal o atingiu quando já se ultimara a evolução
do seu espírito, imerso de todo no sonho de onde não mais despertaria. O asceta despontava, inteiriço, da rudeza
disciplinar de quinze anos de penitência. Requintara nessa aprendizagem de martírios, que tanto preconizam os
velhos luminares da Igreja. Vinha do tirocínio brutal da fome, da sede, das fadigas, das angústias recalcadas e
das misérias fundas. Não tinha dores desconhecidas. A epiderme seca rugava-se-lhe como uma couraça
amolgada e rota sobre a carne morta. Anestesiara-a com a própria dor; macerara-a e sarjara-a de cilícios mais
duros que os buréis de esparto; trouxera-a, de rojo, pelas pedras dos caminhos; esturrara-a nos rescaldos das
secas; inteiriçara-a nos relentos frios; adormecera-a em transitórios repousos, nos leitos dilacerantes das
caatingas...
Abeirara muitas vezes a morte nos jejuns prolongados, com requinte de ascetismo que surpreenderia Tertuliano,
esse
sombrio propagandista da eliminação lenta da matéria, ""descarregando-se do seu sangue, fardo pesado e
importuno da alma impaciente por fugir...""
Para quem estava neste tirocínio de amarguras, aquela ordem de prisão era incidente mínimo. Recebeu-a
indiferente. Proibiu aos fiéis que o defendessem. Entregou-se. Levaram-no à capital da Bahia. Ali, a sua
fisionomia estranha: face morta, rígida como uma máscara, sem olhar e sem risos; pálpebras descidas dentro de
órbitas profundas; e o seu entrajar singularíssimo; e o seu aspecto repugnante, de desenterrado, dentro do
camisolão comprido, feito uma mortalha preta; e os longos cabelos corredios e poentos caindo pelos ombros,
emaranhando-se nos pelos duros da barba descuidada, que descia até à cintura — aferroaram a curiosidade geral.
Passou pelas ruas entre ovações de esconjuros e ""pelos sinais"" dos crentes assustados e das beatas retransidas de
sustos.
Interrogaram-no os juízes estupefatos.
Acusavam-no de velhos crimes, cometidos no torrão nativo. Ouviu o interrogatório e as acusações, e não
murmurou sequer, revestido de impassibilidade marmórea.
A escolta que o trouxera, soube-se depois, espancara-o covardemente nas estradas. Não formulou a mais leve
queixa.
Quedou na tranqüila indiferença superior de um estóico.
Apenas — e este pormenor curioso ouvimo-lo a pessoa insuspeita

que algún mal suceso creo;
porque si yo aquí los veo,
no me queda más que ver.
Vase el REY

PEDRO:            Prendedle.
JUAN:                    ¿Quién ha de osar?
Bien puedo perder la vida;
mas ha de ir tan bien vendida
que a alguno le ha de pesar.
PEDRO:            Matadle.
JUAN:                     ¿Quién os engaña?
Resuelto en morir estoy,
porque caballero soy,
del embajador de España.
Llegue; que, solo, ha de ser
él quien me rinda.
PEDRO:                          Apartad;
a ese cuarto os retirad
todos con esa mujer.
Vanse los otros

Ya estamos solos los dos;
muestra aquí tu esfuerzo y brío.
JUAN:          Aunque tengo esfuerzo, tío,
no le tengo para vos.
PEDRO:            Di quién eres.
JUAN:                            Ya lo digo.
Tu sobrino.
PEDRO:                   ¡Ay, corazón,
que temo alguna traición!
¿Qué es lo que has hecho, enemigo?
¿Cómo estás de aquesta suerte?
Dime presto lo que ha sido.
¡Desobediente, atrevido!
Estoy por darte la muerte.
Acaba.
JUAN:                    Tío y señor,
mozo soy y mozo fuiste;
y pues que de amor supiste,
tenga disculpa mi amor.
Y pues a decir me obligas
la verdad, oye y diréla.
Yo engañé y gocé a Isabela
la duquesa.
PEDRO:                   No prosigas.
Tente.  ¿Cómo la engañaste?
Habla quedo, y cierra el labio.
JUAN:          Fingí ser el duque Octavio.
PEDRO:         No digas más.  ¡Calla!  ¡Baste!
(Perdido soy si el rey sabe     Aparte
este caso.  ¿Qué he de hacer?
Industria me ha de valer
en un negocio tan grave.)
Di, vil, ¿no bastó emprender
con ira y fiereza extraña
tan gran traición en España
con otra noble mujer,
sino en Nápoles también,
y en el palacio real
con mujer tan principal?
¡Castíguete el cielo, amén!
Tu padre desde Castilla
a Nápoles te envió,
y en sus márgenes te dio
tierra la espumosa orilla
del mar de Italia, atendiendo
que el haberte recibido
pagaras agradecido,
y estás su honor ofendiendo.
¡Y en tan principal mujer!
Pero en aquesta ocasión
nos daña la dilación.
Mira qué quieres hacer.
JUAN:             No quiero daros disculpa,
que la habré de dar siniestra.
Mi sangre es, señor, la vuestra;
sacadla, y pague la culpa.
A esos pies estoy rendido,
y ésta es mi espada, señor.
PEDRO:         Alzate, y muestra valor,
que esa humildad me ha vencido.
¿Atreveráste a bajar
por ese balcón?
JUAN:                         Sí atrevo,
que alas en tu favor llevo.
PEDRO:         Pues yo te quiero ayudar.
Vete a Sicilia o Milán,
donde vivas encubierto.
JUAN:          Luego me iré.
PEDRO:                      ¿Cierto?
JUAN:                               Cierto.
PEDRO:         Mis cartas te avisarán
en qué para este suceso
triste, que causado has.
JUAN:          Para mí alegre dirás.
Que tuve culpa confieso.
PEDRO:            Esa mocedad te engaña.
Baja, pues, ese balcón.
JUAN:          (Con tan justa pretensión,
gozoso me parto a España).
Vase don JUAN y entra el REY

PEDRO:            Ejecutando, señor,
tu justicia justa y recta,
el hombre...
REY:                       ¿Murió?
PEDRO:                            ...escapóse
de las cuchillas soberbias.
REY:           ¿De qué forma?
PEDRO:                       De esta forma:
aun no lo mandaste apenas,
cuando, sin dar más disculpa,
la espada en la mano aprieta,
revuelve la capa al brazo,
y con gallarda presteza,
ofendiendo a los soldados
y buscando su defensa,
viendo vecina la muerte,
por el balcón de la huerta
se arroja desesperado.
Siguióle con diligencia
tu gente.  Cuando salieron
por esa vecina puerta,
le hallaron agonizando
como enroscada culebra.
Levantóse, y al decir
los soldados, ""¡Muera, muera!"",
bañado de sangre el rostro,
con tan heroica presteza
se fue, que quedé confuso.
La mujer, que es Isabela,
--que para admirarte nombro--
retirada en esa pieza,
dice que fue el duque Octavio
quien, con engaño y cautela,
la gozó.
REY:                     ¿Qué dices?
PEDRO:                              Digo
lo que ella propia confiesa.
REY:           ¡Ah, pobre honor!  Si eres alma
del hombre, ¿por qué te dejan
en la mujer inconstante,
si es la misma ligereza?
¡Hola!
Sale un CRIADO

CRIADO:              ¿Gran señor?
REY:                               Traed
delante de mi presencia
esa mujer.
PEDRO:                  Ya la guardia
viene, gran señor, con ella.
Trae la GUARDA a ISABELA

ISABELA:       (¿Con qué ojos veré al rey?)
REY:           Idos, y guardad la puerta
de esa cuadra.  Di, mujer,
¿qué rigor, qué airada estrella
te incitó, que en mi palacio,
con hermosura y soberbia,
profanases sus umbrales?
ISABELA:       Señor...
REY:                Calla, que la lengua
no podrá dorar el yerro
que has cometido en mi ofensa.
¡Aquél era del duque Octavio!
ISABELA:       ¡Señor!
REY:                   No, no importan fuerzas,
guardas, crïados, murallas,
fortalecidas almenas,
para Amor, que la de un niño
hasta los muros penetra.
Don Pedro Tenorio, al punto
a esa mujer llevad presa
a una torre, y con secreto
haced que al duque le prendan;
que quiero hacer que le cumpla
la palabra, o la promesa.
ISABELA:       Gran señor, ¡volvedme el rostro!
REY:           Ofensa a mi espalda hecha,
es justicia y es razón
castigarla a espaldas vueltas.
Vase el REY

PEDRO:         Vamos, duquesa.
ISABELA:                      (Mi culpa           Aparte
no hay disculpa que la venza,
mas no será el yerro tanto
si el duque Octavio lo enmienda).
Vanse todos.  Salen el duque OCTAVIO, y RIPIO su
criado

RIPIO:            ¿Tan de mañana, señor,
te levantas?
OCTAVIO:                    No hay sosiego
que pueda apagar el fuego
que enciende en mi alma Amor.
Porque, como al fin es niño,
no apetece cama blanda,
entre regalada holanda,
cubierta de blanco armiño.
Acuéstase.  No sosiega.
Siempre quiere madrugar
por levantarse a jugar,
que al fin como niño juega.
Pensamientos de Isabela
me tienen, amigo, en calma;
que como vive en el alma,
anda el cuerpo siempre en vela,
guardando ausente y presente,
el castillo del honor.
RIPIO:         Perdóname, que tu amor
es amor impertinente.
OCTAVIO:          ¿Qué dices, necio?
RIPIO:                                Esto digo,
impertinencia es amar
como amas.  ¿Vas a escuchar?
OCTAVIO:       Sí, prosigue.
RIPIO:                      Ya prosigo.
¿Quiérete Isabela a ti
OCTAVIO:       ¿Eso, necio, has de dudar?
RIPIO:         No, mas quiero preguntar,
¿Y tú no la quieres?
OCTAVIO:                             Sí.
RIPIO:            Pues, ¿no seré majadero,
y de solar conocido,
si pierdo yo mi sentido
por quien me quiere y la quiero?
Si ella a ti no te quisiera,
fuera bien el porfïarla,
regalarla y adorarla,
y aguardar que se rindiera;
mas si los dos os queréis
con una mesma igualdad,
dime, ¿hay más dificultad
de que luego os desposéis?
OCTAVIO:          Eso fuera, necio, a ser
de lacayo o lavandera
la boda.
RIPIO:               ¿Pues, es quienquiera
una lavandriz mujer,
lavando y fregatrizando,
defendiendo y ofendiendo,
los paños suyos tendiendo,
regalando y remendando?
Dando, dije, porque al dar
no hay cosa que se le iguale,
y si no, a Isabela dale,
a ver si sabe tomar.
Sale un CRIADO

CRIADO:           El embajador de España
en este punto se apea
en el zaguán, y desea,
con ira y fiereza extraña,
hablarte, y si no entendí
yo mal, entiendo es prisión.
OCTAVIO:       ¿Prisión?  Pues, ¿por qué ocasión?
Decid que entre.
Entra Don PEDRO Tenorio con guardas

PEDRO:                          Quien así
con tanto descuido duerme,
limpia tiene la conciencia.
OCTAVIO:       Cuando viene vueselencia
a honrarme y favorecerme,
no es justo que duerma yo.
Velaré toda mi vida.
¿A qué y por qué es la venida?
PEDRO:         Porque aquí el rey me envió.
OCTAVIO:          Si el rey mi señor se acuerda
de mí en aquesta ocasión,
será justicia y razón
que por él la vida pierda.
Decidme, señor, qué dicha
o qué estrella me ha guïado,
que de mí el rey se ha acordado?
PEDRO:         Fue, duque, vuestra desdicha.
Embajador del rey soy.
De él os traigo una embajada.
OCTAVIO:       Marqués, no me inquieta nada.
Decid, que aguardando estoy.
PEDRO:            A prenderos me ha envïado
el rey.  No os alborotéis.
OCTAVIO:       ¿Vos por el rey me prendéis?
Pues, ¿en qué he sido culpado?
PEDRO:            Mejor lo sabéis que yo,
mas, por si acaso me engaño,
escuchad el desengaño,
y a lo que el rey me envió.
Cuando los negros gigantes,
plegando funestos toldos
ya del crepúsculo huían,
tropezando unos en otros,
estando yo con su alteza
tratando ciertos negocios
porque antípodas del sol
son siempre los poderosos,
voces de mujer oímos,
cuyos ecos menos roncos,
por los artesones sacros
nos repitieron ""¡Socorro!""
A las voces y al rüido
acudió, duque, el rey propio,
halló a Isabela en los brazos
de algún hombre poderoso;
mas quien al cielo se atreve
sin duda es gigante o monstruo.
Mandó el rey que los prendiera,
quedé con el hombre solo.
Llegué y quise desarmarle,
pero pienso que el demonio
en él tomó forma humana,
pues que, vuelto en humo, y polvo,
se arrojó por los balcones,
entre los pies de esos olmos,
que coronan del palacio
los chapiteles hermosos.
Hice prender la duquesa,
y en la presencia de todos
dice que es el duque Octavio
el que con mano de esposo
la gozó.
OCTAVIO:               ¿Qué dices?
PEDRO:                             Digo
lo que al mundo es ya notorio,
y que tan claro se sabe,
que a Isabela, por mil modos,
[presa, ya lo ha dicho al rey.
Con vos, señor, o con otro,
esta noche en el palacio,
la habemos hallado todos.
OCTAVIO:          Dejadme, no me digáis
tan gran traición de Isabela,
mas... ¿si fue su amor cautela?
Proseguid, ¿por qué calláis?
(Mas, si veneno me dais
que a un firme corazón toca,
y así a decir me provoca
que imita a la comadreja,
que concibe por la oreja,
para parir por la boca.
¿Será verdad que Isabela,
alma, se olvidó de mí
para darme muerte?  Sí,
que el bien suena y el mal vuela.
Ya el pecho nada recela,
juzgando si son antojos,
que por darme más enojos,
al entendimiento entró,
y por la oreja escuchó,
lo que acreditan los ojos.)
Señor marqués, ¿es posible
que Isabela me ha engañado,
y que mi amor ha burlado?
¡Parece cosa imposible!
¡Oh mujer, ley tan terrible
de honor, a quien me provoco
a emprender!  Mas ya no toco
en tu honor esta cautela.
¿Anoche con Isabela
hombre en palacio?  ¡Estoy loco!
PEDRO:            Como es verdad que en los vientos
hay aves, en el mar peces,
que participan a veces
de todos cuatro elementos;
como en la gloria hay contentos,
lealtad en el buen amigo,
traición en el enemigo,
en la noche oscuridad,
y en el día claridad,
y así es verdad lo que digo.
OCTAVIO:          Marqués, yo os quiero creer,
no hay ya cosa que me espante,
que la mujer más constante
es, en efecto, mujer.
No me queda más que ver,
pues es patente mi agravio.
PEDRO:         Pues que sois prudente y sabio
elegid el mejor medio.
OCTAVIO:       Ausentarme es mi remedio.
PEDRO:         Pues sea presto, duque Octavio.
OCTAVIO:          Embarcarme quiero a España,
y darle a mis males fin.
PEDRO:         Por la puerta del jardín,
duque, esta prisión se engaña.
OCTAVIO:       ¡Ah veleta, ah débil caña!
A más furor me provoco,
y extrañas provincias toco,
huyendo de esta cautela.
Patria, adiós.  ¿Con Isabela
hombre en palacio?  ¡Estoy loco!
Vanse todos.  Sale TISBEA, pescadora, con una
caña de pescar en la mano

TISBEA:           Yo, de cuantas el mar,
pies de jazmín y rosa,
en sus riberas besa
con fugitivas olas,
sola de amor exenta,
como en ventura sola,
tirana me reservo
de sus prisiones locas.
Aquí donde el sol pisa
soñolientas las ondas,
alegrando zafiros
las que espantaba sombras,
por la menuda arena,
unas veces aljófar,
y átomos otras veces
del sol, que así le adora,
oyendo de las aves
las quejas amorosas,
y los combates dulces
del agua entre las rocas,
ya con la sutil caña,
que el débil peso dobla
del necio pececillo,
que el mar salado azota,
o ya con la atarraya,
que en sus moradas hondas
prenden cuantos habitan
aposentos de conchas,
seguramente tengo,
que en libertad se goza
el alma, que, Amor áspid
no le ofende ponzoña.
En pequeñuelo esquife,
y ya en compañía de otras,
tal vez al mar le peino
la cabeza espumosa.
Y cuando más perdidas
querellas de Amor forman,
como de todos río
envidia soy de todas.
Dichosa yo mil veces,
Amor, pues me perdonas,
si ya por ser humilde
no desprecias mi choza.
Obeliscos de paja
mi edificio coronan,
nidos; si no, hay cigarras
o tortolillas locas.
Mi honor conservo en pajas
como fruta sabrosa,
vidrio guardado en ellas
para que no se rompa.
De cuantos pescadores
con fuego Tarragona
de piratas defiende
en la argentada costa,
desprecio soy, encanto,
a sus suspiros sorda,
a sus ruegos terrible,
a sus promesas roca.
Anfriso, a quien el cielo,
con mano poderosa,
prodigió, en cuerpo y alma,
dotado en gracias todas,
medido en las palabras,
liberal en las obras,
sufrido en los desdenes,
modesto en las congojas,
mis pajizos umbrales,
que heladas noches ronda,
a pesar de los tiempos
las mañanas remoza,
pues ya con ramos verdes,
que de los olmos corta,
mis pajas amanecen
ceñidas de lisonjas,
ya con vigüelas dulces,
y sutiles zampoñas,
músicas me consagra,
y todo no le importa,
porque en tirano imperio
vivo de Amor señora,
que halla gusto en sus penas,
y en sus infiernos gloria.
Todas por él se mueren,
y yo, todas las horas,
le mato con desdenes,
de Amor condición propia;
querer donde aborrecen,
despreciar donde adoran,
que si le alegran muere,
y vive si le oprobian.
En tan alegre día,
segura de lisonjas,
mis juveniles años
Amor no los malogra;
que en edad tan florida,
Amor, no es suerte poca,
no ver, tratando en redes,
las tuyas amorosas.
Pero, necio discurso,
que mi ejercicio estorbas,
en él no me diviertas
en cosa que no importa.
Quiero entregar la caña
al viento, y a la boca
del pececillo el cebo.
¡Pero al agua se arrojan
dos hombres de una nave,
antes que el mar la sorba,
que sobre el agua viene,
y en un escollo aborda!
Como hermoso pavón
hace las velas cola,
adonde los pilotos
todos los ojos pongan.
Las olas va escarbando,
y ya su orgullo y pompa
casi la desvanece,
agua un costado toma.
Hundióse, y dejó al viento
la gavia, que la escoja
para morada suya,
que un loco en gavias mora.
Dentro gritos de ""¡Que me ahogo!""

Un hombre al otro aguarda,
que dice que se ahoga.
¡Gallarda cortesía,
en los hombros le toma!
Anquises le hace Eneas
si el mar está hecho Troya.
Ya nadando, las aguas
con valentía corta,
y en la playa no veo
quien le ampare y socorra.
Daré voces.  ¡Tirseo,
Anfriso, Alfredo, hola!
Pescadores me miran,
plega a Dios que me oigan,
mas milagrosamente
ya tierra los dos toman,
sin aliento el que nada,
con vida el que le estorba.
Saca en brazos CATALINÓN a don JUAN, mojados

CATALINÓN:        ¡Válgame la Cananea,
y qué salado es el mar!
Aquí puede bien nadar
el que salvarse desea,
que allá dentro es desatino
donde la muerte se fragua.
Donde Dios juntó tanta agua
¿no juntara tanto vino?
Agua, y salada.  Extremada
cosa para quien no pesca.
Si es mala aun el agua fresca,
¿qué será el agua salada?
¡Oh, quién hallara una fragua
de vino, aunque algo encendido!
Si del agua que he bebido
hoy escapo, no más agua.
Desde hoy abrenuncio de ella,
que la devoción me quita
tanto, que aun agua bendita
no pienso ver, por no vella.
¡Ah señor!  Helado y frío
está.  ¿Si estará ya muerto?
Del mar fue este desconcierto,
y mío este desvarío.
¡Mal haya aquél que primero
pinos en el mar sembró
y el que sus rumbos midió
con quebradizo madero!
¡Maldito sea el vil sastre
que cosió el mar que dibuja
con astronómica aguja,
causando tanto desastre!
¡Maldito sea Jasón,
y Tifis maldito sea!
Muerto está.  No hay quien lo crea.
¡Mísero Catalinón!
¿Qué he de hacer?
TISBEA:                             Hombre, ¿qué tienes?
CATALINÓN:     En desventura iguales,
pescadora, muchos males,
y falta de muchos bienes.
Veo, por librarme a mí,
sin vida a mi señor.  Mira
si es verdad.
TISBEA:                       No, que aun respira.
CATALINÓN:     ¿Por dónde, por aquí?
TISBEA:                             Sí,
pues, ¿por dónde...?
CATALINÓN:                           Bien podía
respirar por otra parte.
TISBEA:        Necio estás.
CATALINÓN:                   Quiero besarte
las manos de nieve fría.
TISBEA:           Ve a llamar los pescadores
que en aquella choza están.
CATALINÓN:     ¿Y si los llamo, ¿vendrán?
TISBEA:        Vendrán presto, no lo ignores.
¿Quién es este caballero?
CATALINÓN:     Es hijo aqueste señor
del camarero mayor
del rey, por quien ser espero
antes de seis días conde
en Sevilla, a donde va,
y adonde su alteza está,
si a mi amistad corresponde.
TISBEA:           ¿Cómo se llama?

CATALINÓN:                        Don Juan
Tenorio.
TISBEA:                 Llama mi gente.

CATALINÓN:     Ya voy.
Vase CATALINÓN.  Coge en el regazo TISBEA a don JUAN

TISBEA:              Mancebo excelente,
gallardo, noble y galán.
Volved en vos, caballero.
JUAN:          ¿Dónde estoy?
TISBEA:                     Ya podéis ver,
en brazos de una mujer.
JUAN:          Vivo en vos, si en el mar muero.
Ya perdí todo el recelo
que me pudiera anegar,
pues del infierno del mar
salgo a vuestro claro cielo.
Un espantoso huracán
dio con mi nave al través,
para arrojarme a esos pies,
que abrigo y puerto me dan,
y en vuestro divino oriente
renazco, y no hay que espantar,
pues veis que hay de amar a mar
una letra solamente.
TISBEA:           ¡Muy grande aliento tenéis
para venir soñoliento,
y más de tanto tormento!
Mucho contento ofrecéis;
pero si es tormento el mar,
y son sus ondas crüeles,
la fuerza de los cordeles,
pienso que os hacen hablar.
Sin duda que habéis bebido
del mar la oración pasada,
pues por ser de agua salada
con tan grande sal ha sido.
Mucho habláis cuando no habláis,
y cuando muerto venís,
mucho al parecer sentís,
¡plega a Dios que no mintáis!
Parecéis caballo griego,
que el mar a mis pies desagua,
pues venís formado de agua,
y estáis preñado de fuego.
Y si mojado abrasáis,
estando enjuto, ¿qué haréis?
Mucho fuego prometéis,
¡plega a Dios que no mintáis!
JUAN:             A Dios, zagala, pluguiera
que en el agua me anegara,
para que cuerdo acabara,
y loco en vos no muriera;
que el mar pudiera anegarme
entre sus olas de plata,
que sus límites desata,
mas no pudiera abrasarme.
Gran parte del sol mostráis,
pues que el sol os da licencia,
pues sólo con la apariencia,
siendo de nieve abrasáis.
TISBEA:           Por más helado que estáis,
tanto fuego en vos tenéis,
que en este mío os ardéis,
¡plega a Dios que no mintáis!
Salen CATALINÓN, CORIDÓN y ANFRISO,
pescadores

CATALINÓN:        Ya vienen todos aquí.
TISBEA:        Y ya está tu dueño vivo.
JUAN:          Con tu presencia recibo
el aliento que perdí.
CORIDÓN:          ¿Qué nos mandas?
TISBEA:                           Coridón,
Anfriso, amigos...
CORIDÓN:                        Todos
buscamos por varios modos
esta dichosa ocasión.
Di lo que mandas, Tisbea,
que por labios de clavel
no lo habrás mandado a aquél
que idolatrarte desea,
apenas, cuando al momento,
sin reservar en llano o sierra,
surque el mar, tale la tierra,
pise el fuego, el aire, el viento.
TISBEA:           (¡Oh, qué mal me parecía        Aparte
estas lisonjas ayer,
y hoy echo en ellas de ver
que sus labios no mentían!)
Estando, amigos, pescando
sobre este peñasco, vi
hundirse una nave allí,
y entre las olas nadando
dos hombres, y compasiva
di voces que nadie oyó;
y en tanta aflicción llegó
libre de la furia esquiva
del mar, sin vida a la arena,
de éste en los hombros cargado,
un hidalgo, ya anegado;
y envuelta en tan triste pena,
a llamaros envïé.
ANFRISO:       Pues aquí todos estamos,
manda que tu gusto hagamos,
lo que pensado no fue.
TISBEA:           Que a mi choza los llevemos
quiero, donde agradecidos
reparemos sus vestidos,
y a ellos los regalemos,
que mi padre gusta mucho
de esta debida piedad.
CATALINÓN:     Extremada es su beldad.
JUAN:          Escucha aparte.
CATALINÓN:                  Ya escucho.
JUAN:             Si te pregunta quién soy,
di que no sabes.
CATALINÓN:                   ¿A mí
quieres advertirme aquí
lo que he de hacer?
JUAN:                             Muerto voy
por la hermosa pescadora.
Esta noche he de gozalla.
CATALINÓN:     ¿De qué suerte?
JUAN:                         Ven y calla.
CORIDÓN:       Anfriso, dentro de un hora
que canten y bailen.
ANFRISO:                           Vamos,
y esta noche nos hagamos
rajas, y palos también.
JUAN:             Muerto soy.
TISBEA:                      ¿Cómo, si andáis?
JUAN:          Ando en pena, como veis.
TISBEA:        Mucho habláis.
JUAN:                       ¡Mucho encendéis!
TISBEA:        ¡Plega a Dios que no mintáis!
Vanse todos.  Salen don GONZALO de
Ulloa y el REY don Alfonso de Castilla

REY:              ¿Cómo os ha sucedido en la embajada,
comendador mayor?
GONZALO:                         Hallé en Lisboa
al rey don Juan, tu primo, previniendo
treinta naves de armada.
REY:                                  ¿Y para dónde?
GONZALO:       Para Goa me dijo, mas yo entiendo
que a otra empresa más fácil apercibe;
a Ceuta, o Tánger pienso que pretende
cercar este verano.
REY:                              Dios le ayude,
y premie el cielo de aumentar su gloria.
¿Qué es lo que concertasteis?
GONZALO:                                   Señor, pide
a Cerpa, y Mora, y Olivencia, y Toro,
y por eso te vuelve a Villaverde,
al Almendral, a Mértola, y Herrera
entre Castilla y Portugal.
REY:                                    Al punto
se firman los conciertos, don Gonzalo;
mas decidme primero cómo ha ido
en el camino, que vendréis cansado,
y alcanzado también.
GONZALO:                          Para serviros,
nunca, señor, me canso.
REY:                                ¿Es buena tierra
Lisboa?
GONZALO:             La mayor ciudad de España.
Y si mandas que diga lo que he visto
de lo exterior y célebre, en un punto
en tu presencia te podré un retrato.
REY:           Gustaré de oírlo.  Dadme silla.
GONZALO:       Es Lisboa una octava maravilla.
De las entrañas de España,
que son las tierras de Cuenca,
nace el caudaloso Tajo,
que media España atraviesa.
Entra en el mar Oceano,
en las sagradas riberas
de esta ciudad por la parte
del sur; mas antes que pierda
su curso y su claro nombre
hace un cuarto entre dos sierras
donde están de todo el orbe
barcas, naves, caravelas.
Hay galeras y saetías,
tantas que desde la tierra
para una gran ciudad
adonde Neptuno reina.
A la parte del poniente,
guardan del puerto dos fuerzas,
de Cascaes y Sangián,
las más fuertes de la tierra.
Está de esta gran ciudad,
poco más de media legua,
Belén, convento del santo
conocido por la piedra
y por el león de guarda,
donde los reyes y reinas,
católicos y cristianos,
tienen sus casas perpetuas.
Luego esta máquina insigne,
desde Alcántara comienza
una gran legua a tenderse
al convento de Lobregas.
En medio está el valle hermoso
coronado de tres cuestas,
que quedara corto Apeles
cuando pintarlas quisiera,
porque miradas de lejos
parecen piñas de perlas,
que están pendientes del cielo,
en cuya grandeza inmensa
se ven diez Romas cifradas
en conventos y en iglesias,
en edificios y calles,
en solares y encomiendas,
en las letras y en las armas,
en la justicia tan recta,
y en una Misericordia,
que está honrando su ribera,
y pudiera honrar a España,
y aun enseñar a tenerla.
Y en lo que yo más alabo
de esta máquina soberbia,
es que del mismo castillo,
en distancia de seis leguas,
se ven sesenta lugares
que llega el mar a sus puertas,
uno de los cuales es
el Convento de Odivelas,
en el cual vi por mis ojos
seiscientas y treinta celdas,
y entre monjas y beatas,
pasan de mil y doscientas.
Tiene desde allí a Lisboa,
en distancia muy pequeña,
mil y ciento y treinta quintas,
que en nuestra provincia Bética
llaman cortijos, y todas
con sus huertos y alamedas.
En medio de la ciudad
hay una plaza soberbia,
que se llama del Ruzío,
grande, hermosa, y bien dispuesta,
que habrá cien años y aun más
que el mar bañaba su arena,
y agora de ella a la mar,
hay treinta mil casas hechas,
que, perdiendo el mar su curso,
se tendió a partes diversas.
Tiene una calle que llaman
Rúa Nova, o calle nueva,
donde se cifra el oriente
en grandezas y riquezas,
tanto que el rey me contó
que hay un mercader en ella,
que por no poder contarlo,
mide el dinero a fanegas.
El terrero, donde tiene
Portugal su casa regia
tiene infinitos navíos,
varados siempre en la tierra,
de sólo cebada y trigo,
de Francia y Ingalaterra.
Pues, el palacio real,
que el Tajo sus manos besa,
es edificio de Ulises,
que basta para grandeza,
de quien toma la ciudad
nombre en la latina lengua,
llamándose Ulisibona,
cuyas armas son la esfera,
por pedestal de las llagas,
que, en la batalla sangrienta,
al rey don Alfonso Enríquez
dio la majestad inmensa.
Tiene en su gran Tarazana
diversas naves, y entre ellas
las naves de la conquista,
tan grandes que, de la tierra
miradas, juzgan los hombres
que tocan en las estrellas.
Y lo que de esta ciudad
te cuento por excelencia,
es, que estando sus vecinos
comiendo, desde las mesas,
ven los copos del pescado
que junto a sus puertas pescan
que, bullendo entre las redes,
vienen a entrarse por ellas.
Y sobre todo el llegar
cada tarde a su ribera
más de mil barcos cargados
de mercancías diversas,
y de sustento ordinario,
pan, aceite, vino y leña,
frutas de infinita suerte,
nieve de sierra de Estrella,
que por las calles a gritos,
puesta sobre las cabezas,
la venden; mas, ¿qué me canso?,
porque es contar las estrellas,
querer contar una parte
de la ciudad opulenta.
Ciento y treinta mil vecinos
tiene, gran señor, por cuenta,
y por no cansarte más,
un rey que tus manos besa.
REY:           Más estimo, don Gonzalo,
escuchar de vuestra lengua
esa relación sucinta,
que haber visto su grandeza.
¿Tenéis hijos?
GONZALO:                      Gran señor,
una hija hermosa y bella,
en cuyo rostro divino
se esmeró naturaleza.
REY:           Pues yo os la quiero casar
de mi mano.
GONZALO:                   Como sea
tu gusto, digo, señor,
que yo la acepto por ella;
pero ¿quién es el esposo?
REY:           Aunque no está en esta tierra,
es de Sevilla, y se llama
don Juan Tenorio.
GONZALO:                         Las nuevas
voy a llevar a doña Ana.

REY:           Id en buena hora, y volved,
Gonzalo, con la respuesta.
Vanse todos.  Salen don JUAN Tenorio y
CATALINÓN

JUAN:             Esas dos yeguas prevén,
pues acomodadas son.
CATALINÓN:     Aunque soy Catalinón,
soy, señor, hombre de bien,
que no se dijo por mí,
""Catalinón es el hombre"",
que sabes que aquese nombre
me asienta al revés aquí.
JUAN:              Mientras que los pescadores
van de regocijo y fiesta,
tú las dos yeguas apresta,
que de sus pies voladores,
sólo nuestro engaño fío.
CATALINÓN:     ¿Al fin pretendes gozar
a Tisbea?

JUAN:                    Si el burlar
es hábito antiguo mío,
¿qué me preguntas, sabiendo
mi condición?
CATALINÓN:                   Ya sé que eres
castigo de las mujeres.
JUAN:          Por Tisbea estoy muriendo,
que es buena moza.
CATALINÓN:                          Buen pago
a su hospedaje deseas.
JUAN:          Necio, lo mismo hizo Eneas
con la reina de Cartago.
CATALINÓN:        Los que fingís y engañáis
las mujeres de esa suerte,
lo pagaréis en la muerte.
JUAN:          ¡Qué largo me lo fiáis!
Catalinón con razón
te llaman.
CATALINÓN:                Tus pareceres
sigue, que en burlar mujeres
quiero ser Catalinón.
Ya viene la desdichada.
JUAN:          Vete, y las yeguas prevén.
CATALINÓN:     (Pobre mujer, harto bien
te pagamos la posada.)
Vase CATALINÓN y sale TISBEA

TISBEA:           El rato que sin ti estoy
estoy ajena de mí.
JUAN:          Por lo que finges ansí,
ningún crédito te doy.
TISBEA:           ¿Por qué?

JUAN:                      Porque si me amaras
mi alma favorecieras.
TISBEA:        Tuya soy.
JUAN:                     Pues, di, ¿qué esperas?
¿O en qué, señora, reparas?
TISBEA:           Reparo en que fue castigo
de Amor el que he hallado en ti.
JUAN:          Si vivo, mi bien, en ti,
a cualquier cosa me obligo.
Aunque yo sepa perder
en tu servicio la vida,
la diera por bien perdida,
y te prometo de ser
tu esposo.
TISBEA:                      Soy desigual
a tu ser.
JUAN:                    Amor es rey
que iguala con justa ley
la seda con el sayal.
TISBEA:           Casi te quiero creer,
mas sois los hombres traidores.
JUAN:          ¿Posible es, mi bien, que ignores
mi amoroso proceder?
Hoy prendes con tus cabellos
mi alma.
TISBEA:                 Ya a ti me allano,
bajo la palabra y mano
de esposo.
JUAN:                      Juro, ojos bellos,
que mirando me matáis,
de ser vuestro esposo.
TISBEA:                             Advierte,
mi bien, que hay Dios y que hay muerte.
JUAN:          ¡Qué largo me lo fiáis!
Ojos bellos, mientras viva
yo vuestro esclavo seré,
ésta es mi mano y mi fe.
TISBEA:        No seré en pagarte esquiva.
JUAN:             Ya en mí mismo no sosiego.
TISBEA:        Ven, y será la cabaña
del amor que me acompaña,
tálamo de nuestro fuego.
Entre estas cañas te esconde,
hasta que tenga lugar.
JUAN:          ¿Por dónde tengo de entrar?
TISBEA:        Ven, y te diré por dónde.
JUAN:             Gloria al alma, mi bien, dais.
TISBEA:        Esa voluntad te obligue,
y si no, Dios te castigue.
JUAN:          ¡Qué largo me lo fiáis!
Vanse y salen CORIDÓN, ANFRISO, BELISA y
MÚSICOS

CORIDÓN:          Ea, llamad a Tisbea,
y las zagalas llamad,
para que en la soledad
el huésped la corte vea.
ANFRISO:          ¡Tisbea, Lucindo, Antandra!
No vi cosa más crüel,
triste y mísero de aquél
que en su fuego es salamandra.
Antes que el baile empecemos,
a Tisbea prevengamos.
BELISA:        Vamos a llamarla.
CORIDÓN:                       Vamos.
BELISA:        A su cabaña lleguemos.
CORIDÓN:          ¿No ves que estará ocupada
con los huéspedes dichosos,
de quien hay mil envidiosos?
ANFRISO:       Siempre es Tisbea envidiada.
BELISA:           Cantad algo mientras viene,
porque queremos bailar.
ANFRISO:       ¿Cómo podrá descansar
cuidado que celos tiene?
Cantan

MÚSICOS:          ""A pescar sale la niña,
tendiendo redes,
y en lugar de pececillos,
las almas prende"".
Sale TISBEA

TISBEA:           ¡Fuego, fuego, que me quemo,
que mi cabaña se abrasa!
Repicad a fuego, amigos,
que ya dan mis ojos agua.
Mi pobre edificio queda
hecho otra Troya en las llamas,
que después que faltan Troyas,
quiere Amor quemar cabañas;
mas si Amor abrasa peñas,
con gran ira, fuerza extraña,
mal podrán de su rigor
reservarse humildes pajas.
¡Fuego, zagales, fuego, agua, agua!
Amor, clemencia, que se abrasa el alma.
¡Ay choza, vil instrumento
de mi deshonra, y mi infamia,
cueva de ladrones fiera,
que mis agravios ampara!
Rayos de ardientes estrellas
en tus cabelleras caigan,
porque abrasadas estén,
si del viento mal peinadas.
¡Ah falso huésped, que dejas
una mujer deshonrada!
¡Nube que del mar salió,
para anegar mis entrañas!
¡Fuego, zagales, fuego, agua, agua!
Amor, clemencia, que se abrasa el alma.
Yo soy la que hacía siempre
de los hombres burla tanta.
¡Que siempre las que hacen burla,
vienen a quedar burladas!
Engañóme el caballero
debajo de fe y palabra
de marido, y profanó
mi honestidad y mi cama.
Gozóme al fin, y yo propia
le di a su rigor las alas,
en dos yeguas que crïé,
con que me burló y se escapa.
Seguidle todos, seguidle,
mas no importa que se vaya,
que en la presencia del rey
tengo de pedir venganza.
¡Fuego, zagales, fuego, agua, agua!
Amor, clemencia, que se abrasa el alma.
Vase TISBEA

CORIDÓN:       Seguid al vil caballero.
ANFRISO:       Triste del que pena y calla,
mas vive el cielo que en él
me he de vengar de esta ingrata.
Vamos tras ella nosotros,
porque va desesperada,
y podrá ser que vaya ella
buscando mayor desgracia.
CORIDÓN:       Tal fin la soberbia tiene,
su locura y confïanza
paró en esto.
Dentro se oye gritando TISBEA ""¡Fuego,
fuego!""

ANFRISO:                 Al mar se arroja.
CORIDÓN:       Tisbea, detente y para.
TISBEA:        ¡Fuego, zagales, fuego, agua, agua!
Amor, clemencia, que se abrasa el alma."

Baka lang magmukhang tanga at sayo'y nakatitig
Hindi lang basta basta ang aking pag-ibig
Steady ka lang dyan, pakinggan mo ang aking himig
Aking dala ay maraming mabubuting intensyon
Di ako tulad ng iba na ang kwento'y imbensyon
Ako yung tipong karakter na  tatlong dimensyonal
Makikiramdam sayo at bibigyan ka ng pagmamahal
Ako yung tipong lalapit kahit na walang hinihingi
Tipong magsosorry kahit di nagtitimpi
Kasi ang ugali mo ngayon ay ilaw na patay sindi
Pero aayusin ko iyon, kapag ikaw ay napangiti
Kaya sana wag ka na sa akin mag alinlangan
Walang ibang lalapitan kasi ikaw aking kailangan

Pangako ko sayo that I would treat you right baby
Di kita kukulitin cause you might get angry
Di kita lalaruin, hindi ako si Andy
Di kita mumultuhin, di ako si Danny
Can't resist to look at you coz of your eyes
You got me really freezing, Elsa with the ice
Won't ever fake my personality, no need for a disguise
I speak bout what I feel, I got no time for lies
I hope that we could have a chance to be together
Gazing at your eyes, man, it feels like forever
I ain't your type so I hope you get your standards lower
So 'til the end that means this won't ever be over

187,191874339,Ilaw,Critz,[15],['R&B/Soul']," And now, I said, let me show in a figure how far our nature is enlightened or unenlightened: --Behold! human beings living in a underground cave, which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the cave; here they have been from their childhood, and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move, and can only see before them, being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads. Above and behind them a fire is blazing at a distance, and between the fire and the prisoners there is a raised way; and you will see, if you look, a low wall built along the way, like the screen which marionette players have in front of them, over which they show the puppets.
 I see.
 And do you see, I said, men passing along the wall carrying all sorts of vessels, and statues and figures of animals made of wood and stone and various materials, which appear over the wall? Some of them are talking, others silent.
 You have shown me a strange image, and they are strange prisoners.
 Like ourselves, I replied; and they see only their own shadows, or the shadows of one another, which the fire throws on the opposite wall of the cave?
 True, he said; how could they see anything but the shadows if they were never allowed to move their heads?
 And of the objects which are being carried in like manner they would only see the shadows?
 Yes, he said.
 And if they were able to converse with one another, would they not suppose that they were naming what was actually before them?
 Very true.
 And suppose further that the prison had an echo which came from the other side, would they not be sure to fancy when one of the passers-by spoke that the voice which they heard came from the passing shadow?
 No question, he replied.
 To them, I said, the truth would be literally nothing but the shadows of the images.
 That is certain.
 And now look again, and see what will naturally follow if the prisoners are released and disabused of their error. At first, when any of them is liberated and compelled suddenly to stand up and turn his neck round and walk and look towards the light, he will suffer sharp pains; the glare will distress him, and he will be unable to see the realities of which in his former state he had seen the shadows; and then conceive some one saying to him, that what he saw before was an illusion, but that now, when he is approaching nearer to being and his eye is turned towards more real existence, he has a clearer vision, -what will be his reply? And you may further imagine that his instructor is pointing to the objects as they pass and requiring him to name them, -will he not be perplexed? Will he not fancy that the shadows which he formerly saw are truer than the objects which are now shown to him?
 Far truer.
 And if he is compelled to look straight at the light, will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take and take in the objects of vision which he can see, and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him?
 True, he now.
 And suppose once more, that he is reluctantly dragged up a steep and rugged ascent, and held fast until he 's forced into the presence of the sun himself, is he not likely to be pained and irritated? When he approaches the light his eyes will be dazzled, and he will not be able to see anything at all of what are now called realities.
 Not all in a moment, he said.
 He will require to grow accustomed to the sight of the upper world. And first he will see the shadows best, next the reflections of men and other objects in the water, and then the objects themselves; then he will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled heaven; and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the sun or the light of the sun by day?
 Certainly.
 Last of he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of him in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and not in another; and he will contemplate him as he is.
 Certainly.
 He will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and the years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, and in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have been accustomed to behold?
 Clearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about him.
 And when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the cave and his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate himself on the change, and pity them?
 Certainly, he would.
 And if they were in the habit of conferring honors among themselves on those who were quickest to observe the passing shadows and to remark which of them went before, and which followed after, and which were together; and who were therefore best able to draw conclusions as to the future, do you think that he would care for such honors and glories, or envy the possessors of them? Would he not say with Homer.
Better to be the poor servant of a poor master, and to endure anything, rather than think as they do and live after their manner?
 Yes, he said, I think that he would rather suffer anything than entertain these false notions and live in this miserable manner.
 Imagine once more, I said, such an one coming suddenly out of the sun to be replaced in his old situation; would he not be certain to have his eyes full of darkness?
 To be sure, he said.
 And if there were a contest, and he had to compete in measuring the shadows with the prisoners who had never moved out of the cave, while his sight was still weak, and before his eyes had become steady (and the time which would be needed to acquire this new habit of sight might be very considerable) would he not be ridiculous? Men would say of him that up he went and down he came without his eyes; and that it was better not even to think of ascending; and if any one tried to loose another and lead him up to the light, let them only catch the offender, and they would put him to death.
 No question, he said.
 This entire allegory, I said, you may now append, dear Glaucon, to the previous argument; the prison-house is the world of sight, the light of the fire is the sun, and you will not misapprehend me if you interpret the journey upwards to be the ascent of the soul into the intellectual world according to my poor belief, which, at your desire, I have expressed whether rightly or wrongly God knows. But, whether true or false, my opinion is that in the world of knowledge the idea of good appears last of all, and is seen only with an effort; and, when seen, is also inferred to be the universal author of all things beautiful and right, parent of light and of the lord of light in this visible world, and the immediate source of reason and truth in the intellectual; and that this is the power upon which he who would act rationally, either in public or private life must have his eye fixed.
 I agree, he said, as far as I am able to understand you.
 Moreover, I said, you must not wonder that those who attain to this beatific vision are unwilling to descend to human affairs; for their souls are ever hastening into the upper world where they desire to dwell; which desire of theirs is very natural, if our allegory may be trusted.
 Yes, very natural.
 And is there anything surprising in one who passes from divine contemplations to the evil state of man, misbehaving himself in a ridiculous manner; if, while his eyes are blinking and before he has become accustomed to the surrounding darkness, he is compelled to fight in courts of law, or in other places, about the images or the shadows of images of justice, and is endeavoring to meet the conceptions of those who have never yet seen absolute justice?
 Anything but surprising, he replied.
 Any one who has common sense will remember that the bewilderments of the eyes are of two kinds, and arise from two causes, either from coming out of the light or from going into the light, which is true of the mind's eye, quite as much as of the bodily eye; and he who remembers this when he sees any one whose vision is perplexed and weak, will not be too ready to laugh; he will first ask whether that soul of man has come out of the brighter light, and is unable to see because unaccustomed to the dark, or having turned from darkness to the day is dazzled by excess of light. And he will count the one happy in his condition and state of being, and he will pity the other; or, if he have a mind to laugh at the soul which comes from below into the light, there will be more reason in this than in the laugh which greets him who returns from above out of the light into the cave.
 That, he said, is a very just distinction.
 But then, if I am right, certain professors of education must be wrong when they say that they can put a knowledge into the soul which was not there before, like sight into blind eyes.
 They undoubtedly say this, he replied.
 Whereas, our argument shows that the power and capacity of learning exists in the soul already; and that just as the eye was unable to turn from darkness to light without the whole body, so too the instrument of knowledge can only by the movement of the whole soul be turned from the world of becoming into that of being, and learn by degrees to endure the sight of being, and of the brightest and best of being, or in other words, of the good.
 Very true.
 And must there not be some art which will effect conversion in the easiest and quickest manner; not implanting the faculty of sight, for that exists already, but has been turned in the wrong direction, and is looking away from the truth?
 Yes, he said, such an art may be presumed.
 And whereas the other so-called virtues of the soul seem to be akin to bodily qualities, for even when they are not originally innate they can be implanted later by habit and exercise, the of wisdom more than anything else contains a divine element which always remains, and by this conversion is rendered useful and profitable; or, on the other hand, hurtful and useless. Did you never observe the narrow intelligence flashing from the keen eye of a clever rogue --how eager he is, how clearly his paltry soul sees the way to his end; he is the reverse of blind, but his keen eyesight is forced into the service of evil, and he is mischievous in proportion to his cleverness.
 Very true, he said.
 But what if there had been a circumcision of such natures in the days of their youth; and they had been severed from those sensual pleasures, such as eating and drinking, which, like leaden weights, were attached to them at their birth, and which drag them down and turn the vision of their souls upon the things that are below --if, I say, they had been released from these impediments and turned in the opposite direction, the very same faculty in them would have seen the truth as keenly as they see what their eyes are turned to now.
 Very likely.
 Yes, I said; and there is another thing which is likely. or rather a necessary inference from what has preceded, that neither the uneducated and uninformed of the truth, nor yet those who never make an end of their education, will be able ministers of State; not the former, because they have no single aim of duty which is the rule of all their actions, private as well as public; nor the latter, because they will not act at all except upon compulsion, fancying that they are already dwelling apart in the islands of the blest.
 Very true, he replied.
 Then, I said, the business of us who are the founders of the State will be to compel the best minds to attain that knowledge which we have already shown to be the greatest of all-they must continue to ascend until they arrive at the good; but when they have ascended and seen enough we must not allow them to do as they do now.
 What do you mean?
 I mean that they remain in the upper world: but this must not be allowed; they must be made to descend again among the prisoners in the cave, and partake of their labors and honors, whether they are worth having or not.
 But is not this unjust? he said; ought we to give them a worse life, when they might have a better?
 You have again forgotten, my friend, I said, the intention of the legislator, who did not aim at making any one class in the State happy above the rest; the happiness was to be in the whole State, and he held the citizens together by persuasion and necessity, making them benefactors of the State, and therefore benefactors of one another; to this end he created them, not to please themselves, but to be his instruments in binding up the State.
 True, he said, I had forgotten.
 Observe, Glaucon, that there will be no injustice in compelling our philosophers to have a care and providence of others; we shall explain to them that in other States, men of their class are not obliged to share in the toils of politics: and this is reasonable, for they grow up at their own sweet will, and the government would rather not have them. Being self-taught, they cannot be expected to show any gratitude for a culture which they have never received. But we have brought you into the world to be rulers of the hive, kings of yourselves and of the other citizens, and have educated you far better and more perfectly than they have been educated, and you are better able to share in the double duty. Wherefore each of you, when his turn comes, must go down to the general underground abode, and get the habit of seeing in the dark. When you have acquired the habit, you will see ten thousand times better than the inhabitants of the cave, and you will know what the several images are, and what they represent, because you have seen the beautiful and just and good in their truth. And thus our State which is also yours will be a reality, and not a dream only, and will be administered in a spirit unlike that of other States, in which men fight with one another about shadows only and are distracted in the struggle for power, which in their eyes is a great good. Whereas the truth is that the State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most quietly governed, and the State in which they are most eager, the worst.
 Quite true, he replied.
 And will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn at the toils of State, when they are allowed to spend the greater part of their time with one another in the heavenly light?
 Impossible, he answered; for they are just men, and the commands which we impose upon them are just; there can be no doubt that every one of them will take office as a stern necessity, and not after the fashion of our present rulers of State.
 Yes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You must contrive for your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler, and then you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State which offers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver and gold, but in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of life. Whereas if they go to the administration of public affairs, poor and hungering after the' own private advantage, thinking that hence they are to snatch the chief good, order there can never be; for they will be fighting about office, and the civil and domestic broils which thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole State.
 Most true, he replied.
 And the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition is that of true philosophy. Do you know of any other?
 Indeed, I do not, he said.
 And those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? For, if they are, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.
 No question.
 Who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians? Surely they will be the men who are wisest about affairs of State, and by whom the State is best administered, and who at the same time have other honors and another and a better life than that of politics?
 They are the men, and I will choose them, he replied.
 And now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced, and how they are to be brought from darkness to light, -- as some are said to have ascended from the world below to the gods?
 By all means, he replied.
 The process, I said, is not the turning over of an oyster-shell, but the turning round of a soul passing from a day which is little better than night to the true day of being, that is, the ascent from below, which we affirm to be true philosophy?
 Quite so.
And should we not enquire what sort of knowledge has the power of effecting such a change?

Certainly.
What sort of knowledge is there which would draw the soul from becoming to being? And another consideration has just occurred to me: You will remember that our young men are to be warrior athletes.

Yes, that was said.

Then this new kind of knowledge must have an additional quality? What quality?

Usefulness in war.

Yes, if possible.

There were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?

Just so.
There was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the body, and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and corruption?

True.
Then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover? No.
But what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent into our former scheme?

Music, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic, and trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony making them harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them science; and the words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements of rhythm and harmony in them. But in music there was nothing which tended to that good which you are now seeking.

You are most accurate, I said, in your recollection; in music there certainly was nothing of the kind. But what branch of knowledge is there, my dear Glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since all the useful arts were reckoned mean by us?

Undoubtedly; and yet if music and gymnastic are excluded, and the arts are also excluded, what remains?

Well, I said, there may be nothing left of our special subjects; and then we shall have to take something which is not special, but of universal application.

What may that be?
A something which all arts and sciences and intelligences use in common, and which every one first has to learn among the elements of education.

What is that?
The little matter of distinguishing one, two, and three --in a word, number and calculation: --do not all arts and sciences necessarily partake of them?

Yes.
Then the art of war partakes of them?
To the sure.
Then Palamedes, whenever he appears in tragedy, proves Agamemnon ridiculously unfit to be a general. Did you never remark how he declares that he had invented number, and had numbered the ships and set in array the ranks of the army at Troy; which implies that they had never been numbered before, and Agamemnon must be supposed literally to have been incapable of counting his own feet --how could he if he was ignorant of number? And if that is true, what sort of general must he have been?

I should say a very strange one, if this was as you say.
Can we deny that a warrior should have a knowledge of arithmetic?
Certainly he should, if he is to have the smallest understanding of military tactics, or indeed, I should rather say, if he is to be a man at all.

I should like to know whether you have the same notion which I have of this study?

What is your notion?
It appears to me to be a study of the kind which we are seeking, and which leads naturally to reflection, but never to have been rightly used; for the true use of it is simply to draw the soul towards being.

Will you explain your meaning? he said.
I will try, I said; and I wish you would share the enquiry with me, and say 'yes' or 'no' when I attempt to distinguish in my own mind what branches of knowledge have this attracting power, in order that we may have clearer proof that arithmetic is, as I suspect, one of them.
Explain, he said.
I mean to say that objects of sense are of two kinds; some of them do not invite thought because the sense is an adequate judge of them; while in the case of other objects sense is so untrustworthy that further enquiry is imperatively demanded.

You are clearly referring, he said, to the manner in which the senses are imposed upon by distance, and by painting in light and shade.
No, I said, that is not at all my meaning.
Then what is your meaning?
When speaking of uninviting objects, I mean those which do not pass from one sensation to the opposite; inviting objects are those which do; in this latter case the sense coming upon the object, whether at a distance or near, gives no more vivid idea of anything in particular than of its opposite. An illustration will make my meaning clearer: --here are three fingers --a little finger, a second finger, and a middle finger.

Very good.
You may suppose that they are seen quite close: And here comes the point.
What is it?
Each of them equally appears a finger, whether seen in the middle or at the extremity, whether white or black, or thick or thin --it makes no difference; a finger is a finger all the same. In these cases a man is not compelled to ask of thought the question, what is a finger? for the sight never intimates to the mind that a finger is other than a finger.

True.
And therefore, I said, as we might expect, there is nothing here which invites or excites intelligence.
There is not, he said.
But is this equally true of the greatness and smallness of the fingers? Can sight adequately perceive them? and is no difference made by the circumstance that one of the fingers is in the middle and another at the extremity? And in like manner does the touch adequately perceive the qualities of thickness or thinness, or softness or hardness? And so of the other senses; do they give perfect intimations of such matters? Is not their mode of operation on this wise --the sense which is concerned with the quality of hardness is necessarily concerned also with the quality of softness, and only intimates to the soul that the same thing is felt to be both hard and soft?
You are quite right, he said.
And must not the soul be perplexed at this intimation which the sense gives of a hard which is also soft? What, again, is the meaning of light and heavy, if that which is light is also heavy, and that which is heavy, light?
Yes, he said, these intimations which the soul receives are very curious and require to be explained.
Yes, I said, and in these perplexities the soul naturally summons to her aid calculation and intelligence, that she may see whether the several objects announced to her are one or two.
True.
And if they turn out to be two, is not each of them one and different?
Certainly.
And if each is one, and both are two, she will conceive the two as in a state of division, for if there were undivided they could only be conceived of as one?
True.
The eye certainly did see both small and great, but only in a confused manner; they were not distinguished.
Yes.
Whereas the thinking mind, intending to light up the chaos, was compelled to reverse the process, and look at small and great as separate and not confused.
Very true.
Was not this the beginning of the enquiry 'What is great?' and 'What is small?'
Exactly so.
And thus arose the distinction of the visible and the intelligible.
Most true.
This was what I meant when I spoke of impressions which invited the intellect, or the reverse --those which are simultaneous with opposite impressions, invite thought; those which are not simultaneous do not.
I understand, he said, and agree with you.
And to which class do unity and number belong?
I do not know, he replied.
Think a little and you will see that what has preceded will supply the answer; for if simple unity could be adequately perceived by the sight or by any other sense, then, as we were saying in the case of the finger, there would be nothing to attract towards being; but when there is some contradiction always present, and one is the reverse of one and involves the conception of plurality, then thought begins to be aroused within us, and the soul perplexed and wanting to arrive at a decision asks 'What is absolute unity?' This is the way in which the study of the one has a power of drawing and converting the mind to the contemplation of true being.
And surely, he said, this occurs notably in the case of one; for we see the same thing to be both one and infinite in multitude?
Yes, I said; and this being true of one must be equally true of all number?
Certainly.
And all arithmetic and calculation have to do with number?
Yes.
And they appear to lead the mind towards truth?
Yes, in a very remarkable manner.
Then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking, having a double use, military and philosophical; for the man of war must learn the art of number or he will not know how to array his troops, and the philosopher also, because he has to rise out of the sea of change and lay hold of true being, and therefore he must be an arithmetician.
That is true.
And our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?
Certainly.
Then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe; and we must endeavour to persuade those who are prescribe to be the principal men of our State to go and learn arithmetic, not as amateurs, but they must carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind only; nor again, like merchants or retail-traders, with a view to buying or selling, but for the sake of their military use, and of the soul herself; and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass from becoming to truth and being.
That is excellent, he said.
Yes, I said, and now having spoken of it, I must add how charming the science is! and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end, if pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!
How do you mean?
I mean, as I was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and elevating effect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument. You know how steadily the masters of the art repel and ridicule any one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is calculating, and if you divide, they multiply, taking care that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions.
That is very true.
Now, suppose a person were to say to them: O my friends, what are these wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you say, there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal, invariable, indivisible, --what would they answer?
They would answer, as I should conceive, that they were speaking of those numbers which can only be realised in thought.
Then you see that this knowledge may be truly called necessary, necessitating as it clearly does the use of the pure intelligence in the attainment of pure truth?
Yes; that is a marked characteristic of it.
And have you further observed, that those who have a natural talent for calculation are generally quick at every other kind of knowledge; and even the dull if they have had an arithmetical training, although they may derive no other advantage from it, always become much quicker than they would otherwise have been.
Very true, he said.
And indeed, you will not easily find a more difficult study, and not many as difficult.
You will not.
And, for all these reasons, arithmetic is a kind of knowledge in which the best natures should be trained, and which must not be given up.
I agree.
Let this then be made one of our subjects of education. And next, shall we enquire whether the kindred science also concerns us?
You mean geometry?
Exactly so.
Clearly, he said, we are concerned with that part of geometry which relates to war; for in pitching a camp, or taking up a position, or closing or extending the lines of an army, or any other military manoeuvre, whether in actual battle or on a march, it will make all the difference whether a general is or is not a geometrician.
Yes, I said, but for that purpose a very little of either geometry or calculation will be enough; the question relates rather to the greater and more advanced part of geometry --whether that tends in any degree to make more easy the vision of the idea of good; and thither, as I was saying, all things tend which compel the soul to turn her gaze towards that place, where is the full perfection of being, which she ought, by all means, to behold.
True, he said.
Then if geometry compels us to view being, it concerns us; if becoming only, it does not concern us?
Yes, that is what we assert.
Yet anybody who has the least acquaintance with geometry will not deny that such a conception of the science is in flat contradiction to the ordinary language of geometricians.
How so?
They have in view practice only, and are always speaking? in a narrow and ridiculous manner, of squaring and extending and applying and the like --they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life; whereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science.
Certainly, he said.
Then must not a further admission be made?
What admission?
That the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal, and not of aught perishing and transient.
That, he replied, may be readily allowed, and is true.
Then, my noble friend, geometry will draw the soul towards truth, and create the spirit of philosophy, and raise up that which is now unhappily allowed to fall down.
Nothing will be more likely to have such an effect.
Then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants of your fair city should by all means learn geometry. Moreover the science has indirect effects, which are not small.
Of what kind? he said.
There are the military advantages of which you spoke, I said; and in all departments of knowledge, as experience proves, any one who has studied geometry is infinitely quicker of apprehension than one who has not.
Yes indeed, he said, there is an infinite difference between them.
Then shall we propose this as a second branch of knowledge which our youth will study?
Let us do so, he replied.
And suppose we make astronomy the third --what do you say?
I am strongly inclined to it, he said; the observation of the seasons and of months and years is as essential to the general as it is to the farmer or sailor.
I am amused, I said, at your fear of the world, which makes you guard against the appearance of insisting upon useless studies; and I quite admit the difficulty of believing that in every man there is an eye of the soul which, when by other pursuits lost and dimmed, is by these purified and re-illumined; and is more precious far than ten thousand bodily eyes, for by it alone is truth seen. Now there are two classes of persons: one class of those who will agree with you and will take your words as a revelation; another class to whom they will be utterly unmeaning, and who will naturally deem them to be idle tales, for they see no sort of profit which is to be obtained from them. And therefore you had better decide at once with which of the two you are proposing to argue. You will very likely say with neither, and that your chief aim in carrying on the argument is your own improvement; at the same time you do not grudge to others any benefit which they may receive.
I think that I should prefer to carry on the argument mainly on my own behalf.
Then take a step backward, for we have gone wrong in the order of the sciences.
What was the mistake? he said.
After plane geometry, I said, we proceeded at once to solids in revolution, instead of taking solids in themselves; whereas after the second dimension the third, which is concerned with cubes and dimensions of depth, ought to have followed.
That is true, Socrates; but so little seems to be known as yet about these subjects.
Why, yes, I said, and for two reasons: --in the first place, no government patronises them; this leads to a want of energy in the pursuit of them, and they are difficult; in the second place, students cannot learn them unless they have a director. But then a director can hardly be found, and even if he could, as matters now stand, the students, who are very conceited, would not attend to him. That, however, would be otherwise if the whole State became the director of these studies and gave honour to them; then disciples would want to come, and there would be continuous and earnest search, and discoveries would be made; since even now, disregarded as they are by the world, and maimed of their fair proportions, and although none of their votaries can tell the use of them, still these studies force their way by their natural charm, and very likely, if they had the help of the State, they would some day emerge into light.
Yes, he said, there is a remarkable charm in them. But I do not clearly understand the change in the order. First you began with a geometry of plane surfaces?
Yes, I said.
And you placed astronomy next, and then you made a step backward?
Yes, and I have delayed you by my hurry; the ludicrous state of solid geometry, which, in natural order, should have followed, made me pass over this branch and go on to astronomy, or motion of solids.
True, he said.
Then assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence if encouraged by the State, let us go on to astronomy, which will be fourth.
The right order, he replied. And now, Socrates, as you rebuked the vulgar manner in which I praised astronomy before, my praise shall be given in your own spirit. For every one, as I think, must see that astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another.
Every one but myself, I said; to every one else this may be clear, but not to me.
And what then would you say?
I should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.
What do you mean? he asked.
You, I replied, have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our knowledge of the things above. And I dare say that if a person were to throw his head back and study the fretted ceiling, you would still think that his mind was the percipient, and not his eyes. And you are very likely right, and I may be a simpleton: but, in my opinion, that knowledge only which is of being and of the unseen can make the soul look upwards, and whether a man gapes at the heavens or blinks on the ground, seeking to learn some particular of sense, I would deny that he can learn, for nothing of that sort is matter of science; his soul is looking downwards, not upwards, whether his way to knowledge is by water or by land, whether he floats, or only lies on his back.
I acknowledge, he said, the justice of your rebuke. Still, I should like to ascertain how astronomy can be learned in any manner more conducive to that knowledge of which we are speaking?
I will tell you, I said: The starry heaven which we behold is wrought upon a visible ground, and therefore, although the fairest and most perfect of visible things, must necessarily be deemed inferior far to the true motions of absolute swiftness and absolute slowness, which are relative to each other, and carry with them that which is contained in them, in the true number and in every true figure. Now, these are to be apprehended by reason and intelligence, but not by sight.
True, he replied.
The spangled heavens should be used as a pattern and with a view to that higher knowledge; their beauty is like the beauty of figures or pictures excellently wrought by the hand of Daedalus, or some other great artist, which we may chance to behold; any geometrician who saw them would appreciate the exquisiteness of their workmanship, but he would never dream of thinking that in them he could find the true equal or the true double, or the truth of any other proportion.
No, he replied, such an idea would be ridiculous.
And will not a true astronomer have the same feeling when he looks at the movements of the stars? Will he not think that heaven and the things in heaven are framed by the Creator of them in the most perfect manner? But he will never imagine that the proportions of night and day, or of both to the month, or of the month to the year, or of the stars to these and to one another, and any other things that are material and visible can also be eternal and subject to no deviation --that would be absurd; and it is equally absurd to take so much pains in investigating their exact truth.
I quite agree, though I never thought of this before.
Then, I said, in astronomy, as in geometry, we should employ problems, and let the heavens alone if we would approach the subject in the right way and so make the natural gift of reason to be of any real use.
That, he said, is a work infinitely beyond our present astronomers.
Yes, I said; and there are many other things which must also have a similar extension given to them, if our legislation is to be of any value. But can you tell me of any other suitable study?
No, he said, not without thinking.
Motion, I said, has many forms, and not one only; two of them are obvious enough even to wits no better than ours; and there are others, as I imagine, which may be left to wiser persons.
But where are the two?
There is a second, I said, which is the counterpart of the one already named.
And what may that be?
The second, I said, would seem relatively to the ears to be what the first is to the eyes; for I conceive that as the eyes are designed to look up at the stars, so are the ears to hear harmonious motions; and these are sister sciences --as the Pythagoreans say, and we, Glaucon, agree with them?
Yes, he replied.
But this, I said, is a laborious study, and therefore we had better go and learn of them; and they will tell us whether there are any other applications of these sciences. At the same time, we must not lose sight of our own higher object.
What is that?
There is a perfection which all knowledge ought to reach, and which our pupils ought also to attain, and not to fall short of, as I was saying that they did in astronomy. For in the science of harmony, as you probably know, the same thing happens. The teachers of harmony compare the sounds and consonances which are heard only, and their labour, like that of the astronomers, is in vain.
Yes, by heaven! he said; and 'tis as good as a play to hear them talking about their condensed notes, as they call them; they put their ears close alongside of the strings like persons catching a sound from their neighbour's wall --one set of them declaring that they distinguish an intermediate note and have found the least interval which should be the unit of measurement; the others insisting that the two sounds have passed into the same --either party setting their ears before their understanding.
You mean, I said, those gentlemen who tease and torture the strings and rack them on the pegs of the instrument: might carry on the metaphor and speak after their manner of the blows which the plectrum gives, and make accusations against the strings, both of backwardness and forwardness to sound; but this would be tedious, and therefore I will only say that these are not the men, and that I am referring to the Pythagoreans, of whom I was just now proposing to enquire about harmony. For they too are in error, like the astronomers; they investigate the numbers of the harmonies which are heard, but they never attain to problems-that is to say, they never reach the natural harmonies of number, or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not.
That, he said, is a thing of more than mortal knowledge.
A thing, I replied, which I would rather call useful; that is, if sought after with a view to the beautiful and good; but if pursued in any other spirit, useless. Very true, he said.
Now, when all these studies reach the point of inter-communion and connection with one another, and come to be considered in their mutual affinities, then, I think, but not till then, will the pursuit of them have a value for our objects; otherwise there is no profit in them.
I suspect so; but you are speaking, Socrates, of a vast work.
What do you mean? I said; the prelude or what? Do you not know that all this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we have to learn? For you surely would not regard the skilled mathematician as a dialectician?
Assuredly not, he said; I have hardly ever known a mathematician who was capable of reasoning.
But do you imagine that men who are unable to give and take a reason will have the knowledge which we require of them?
Neither can this be supposed.
And so, Glaucon, I said, we have at last arrived at the hymn of dialectic. This is that strain which is of the intellect only, but which the faculty of sight will nevertheless be found to imitate; for sight, as you may remember, was imagined by us after a while to behold the real animals and stars, and last of all the sun himself. And so with dialectic; when a person starts on the discovery of the absolute by the light of reason only, and without any assistance of sense, and perseveres until by pure intelligence he arrives at the perception of the absolute good, he at last finds himself at the end of the intellectual world, as in the case of sight at the end of the visible.
Exactly, he said.
Then this is the progress which you call dialectic?
True.
But the release of the prisoners from chains, and their translation from the shadows to the images and to the light, and the ascent from the underground den to the sun, while in his presence they are vainly trying to look on animals and plants and the light of the sun, but are able to perceive even with their weak eyes the images in the water (which are divine), and are the shadows of true existence (not shadows of images cast by a light of fire, which compared with the sun is only an image) --this power of elevating the highest principle in the soul to the contemplation of that which is best in existence, with which we may compare the raising of that faculty which is the very light of the body to the sight of that which is brightest in the material and visible world --this power is given, as I was saying, by all that study and pursuit of the arts which has been described.
I agree in what you are saying, he replied, which may be hard to believe, yet, from another point of view, is harder still to deny. This, however, is not a theme to be treated of in passing only, but will have to be discussed again and again. And so, whether our conclusion be true or false, let us assume all this, and proceed at once from the prelude or preamble to the chief strain, and describe that in like manner. Say, then, what is the nature and what are the divisions of dialectic, and what are the paths which lead thither; for these paths will also lead to our final rest?
Dear Glaucon, I said, you will not be able to follow me here, though I would do my best, and you should behold not an image only but the absolute truth, according to my notion. Whether what I told you would or would not have been a reality I cannot venture to say; but you would have seen something like reality; of that I am confident.
Doubtless, he replied.
But I must also remind you, that the power of dialectic alone can reveal this, and only to one who is a disciple of the previous sciences.
Of that assertion you may be as confident as of the last.
And assuredly no one will argue that there is any other method of comprehending by any regular process all true existence or of ascertaining what each thing is in its own nature; for the arts in general are concerned with the desires or opinions of men, or are cultivated with a view to production and construction, or for the preservation of such productions and constructions; and as to the mathematical sciences which, as we were saying, have some apprehension of true being --geometry and the like --they only dream about being, but never can they behold the waking reality so long as they leave the hypotheses which they use unexamined, and are unable to give an account of them. For when a man knows not his own first principle, and when the conclusion and intermediate steps are also constructed out of he knows not what, how can he imagine that such a fabric of convention can ever become science?
Impossible, he said.
Then dialectic, and dialectic alone, goes directly to the first principle and is the only science which does away with hypotheses in order to make her ground secure; the eye of the soul, which is literally buried in an outlandish slough, is by her gentle aid lifted upwards; and she uses as handmaids and helpers in the work of conversion, the sciences which we have been discussing. Custom terms them sciences, but they ought to have some other name, implying greater clearness than opinion and less clearness than science: and this, in our previous sketch, was called understanding. But why should we dispute about names when we have realities of such importance to consider?
Why indeed, he said, when any name will do which expresses the thought of the mind with clearness?
At any rate, we are satisfied, as before, to have four divisions; two for intellect and two for opinion, and to call the first division science, the second understanding, the third belief, and the fourth perception of shadows, opinion being concerned with becoming, and intellect with being; and so to make a proportion: --
As being is to becoming, so is pure intellect to opinion.
And as intellect is to opinion, so is science to belief, and understanding to the perception of shadows. But let us defer the further correlation and subdivision of the subjects of opinion and of intellect, for it will be a long enquiry, many times longer than this has been.
As far as I understand, he said, I agree.
And do you also agree, I said, in describing the dialectician as one who attains a conception of the essence of each thing? And he who does not possess and is therefore unable to impart this conception, in whatever degree he fails, may in that degree also be said to fail in intelligence? Will you admit so much?
Yes, he said; how can I deny it?
And you would say the same of the conception of the good?
Until the person is able to abstract and define rationally the idea of good, and unless he can run the gauntlet of all objections, and is ready to disprove them, not by appeals to opinion, but to absolute truth, never faltering at any step of the argument --unless he can do all this, you would say that he knows neither the idea of good nor any other good; he apprehends only a shadow, if anything at all, which is given by opinion and not by science; --dreaming and slumbering in this life, before he is well awake here, he arrives at the world below, and has his final quietus.
In all that I should most certainly agree with you.
And surely you would not have the children of your ideal State, whom you are nurturing and educating --if the ideal ever becomes a reality --you would not allow the future rulers to be like posts, having no reason in them, and yet to be set in authority over the highest matters?
Certainly not.
Then you will make a law that they shall have such an education as will enable them to attain the greatest skill in asking and answering questions?
Yes, he said, you and I together will make it.
Dialectic, then, as you will agree, is the coping-stone of the sciences, and is set over them; no other science can be placed higher --the nature of knowledge can no further go?
I agree, he said.
But to whom we are to assign these studies, and in what way they are to be assigned, are questions which remain to be considered?
Yes, clearly.
You remember, I said, how the rulers were chosen before?
Certainly, he said.
The same natures must still be chosen, and the preference again given to the surest and the bravest, and, if possible, to the fairest; and, having noble and generous tempers, they should also have the natural gifts which will facilitate their education.
And what are these?
Such gifts as keenness and ready powers of acquisition; for the mind more often faints from the severity of study than from the severity of gymnastics: the toil is more entirely the mind's own, and is not shared with the body.
Very true, he replied.
Further, he of whom we are in search should have a good memory, and be an unwearied solid man who is a lover of labour in any line; or he will never be able to endure the great amount of bodily exercise and to go through all the intellectual discipline and study which we require of him.
Certainly, he said; he must have natural gifts.
The mistake at present is, that those who study philosophy have no vocation, and this, as I was before saying, is the reason why she has fallen into disrepute: her true sons should take her by the hand and not bastards.
What do you mean?
In the first place, her votary should not have a lame or halting industry --I mean, that he should not be half industrious and half idle: as, for example, when a man is a lover of gymnastic and hunting, and all other bodily exercises, but a hater rather than a lover of the labour of learning or listening or enquiring. Or the occupation to which he devotes himself may be of an opposite kind, and he may have the other sort of lameness.
Certainly, he said.
And as to truth, I said, is not a soul equally to be deemed halt and lame which hates voluntary falsehood and is extremely indignant at herself and others when they tell lies, but is patient of involuntary falsehood, and does not mind wallowing like a swinish beast in the mire of ignorance, and has no shame at being detected?
To be sure.
And, again, in respect of temperance, courage, magnificence, and every other virtue, should we not carefully distinguish between the true son and the bastard? for where there is no discernment of such qualities States and individuals unconsciously err and the State makes a ruler, and the individual a friend, of one who, being defective in some part of virtue, is in a figure lame or a bastard.
That is very true, he said.
All these things, then, will have to be carefully considered by us; and if only those whom we introduce to this vast system of education and training are sound in body and mind, justice herself will have nothing to say against us, and we shall be the saviours of the constitution and of the State; but, if our pupils are men of another stamp, the reverse will happen, and we shall pour a still greater flood of ridicule on philosophy than she has to endure at present.
That would not be creditable.
Certainly not, I said; and yet perhaps, in thus turning jest into earnest I am equally ridiculous.
In what respect?
I had forgotten, I said, that we were not serious, and spoke with too much excitement. For when I saw philosophy so undeservedly trampled under foot of men I could not help feeling a sort of indignation at the authors of her disgrace: and my anger made me too vehement.
Indeed! I was listening, and did not think so.
But I, who am the speaker, felt that I was. And now let me remind you that, although in our former selection we chose old men, we must not do so in this. Solon was under a delusion when he said that a man when he grows old may learn many things --for he can no more learn much than he can run much; youth is the time for any extraordinary toil.
Of course.
And, therefore, calculation and geometry and all the other elements of instruction, which are a preparation for dialectic, should be presented to the mind in childhood; not, however, under any notion of forcing our system of education.
Why not?
Because a freeman ought not to be a slave in the acquisition of knowledge of any kind. Bodily exercise, when compulsory, does no harm to the body; but knowledge which is acquired under compulsion obtains no hold on the mind.
Very true.
Then, my good friend, I said, do not use compulsion, but let early education be a sort of amusement; you will then be better able to find out the natural bent.
That is a very rational notion, he said.
Do you remember that the children, too, were to be taken to see the battle on horseback; and that if there were no danger they were to be brought close up and, like young hounds, have a taste of blood given them?
Yes, I remember.
The same practice may be followed, I said, in all these things --labours, lessons, dangers --and he who is most at home in all of them ought to be enrolled in a select number.
At what age?
At the age when the necessary gymnastics are over: the period whether of two or three years which passes in this sort of training is useless for any other purpose; for sleep and exercise are unpropitious to learning; and the trial of who is first in gymnastic exercises is one of the most important tests to which our youth are subjected.
Certainly, he replied.
After that time those who are selected from the class of twenty years old will be promoted to higher honour, and the sciences which they learned without any order in their early education will now be brought together, and they will be able to see the natural relationship of them to one another and to true being.
Yes, he said, that is the only kind of knowledge which takes lasting root.
Yes, I said; and the capacity for such knowledge is the great criterion of dialectical talent: the comprehensive mind is always the dialectical.
I agree with you, he said.
These, I said, are the points which you must consider; and those who have most of this comprehension, and who are more steadfast in their learning, and in their military and other appointed duties, when they have arrived at the age of thirty have to be chosen by you out of the select class, and elevated to higher honour; and you will have to prove them by the help of dialectic, in order to learn which of them is able to give up the use of sight and the other senses, and in company with truth to attain absolute being: And here, my friend, great caution is required.
Why great caution?
Do you not remark, I said, how great is the evil which dialectic has introduced?
What evil? he said.
The students of the art are filled with lawlessness.
Quite true, he said.
Do you think that there is anything so very unnatural or inexcusable in their case? or will you make allowance for them?
In what way make allowance?
I want you, I said, by way of parallel, to imagine a supposititious son who is brought up in great wealth; he is one of a great and numerous family, and has many flatterers. When he grows up to manhood, he learns that his alleged are not his real parents; but who the real are he is unable to discover. Can you guess how he will be likely to behave towards his flatterers and his supposed parents, first of all during the period when he is ignorant of the false relation, and then again when he knows? Or shall I guess for you?
If you please.
Then I should say, that while he is ignorant of the truth he will be likely to honour his father and his mother and his supposed relations more than the flatterers; he will be less inclined to neglect them when in need, or to do or say anything against them; and he will be less willing to disobey them in any important matter.
He will.
But when he has made the discovery, I should imagine that he would diminish his honour and regard for them, and would become more devoted to the flatterers; their influence over him would greatly increase; he would now live after their ways, and openly associate with them, and, unless he were of an unusually good disposition, he would trouble himself no more about his supposed parents or other relations.
Well, all that is very probable. But how is the image applicable to the disciples of philosophy?
In this way: you know that there are certain principles about justice and honour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental authority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.
That is true.
There are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter and attract the soul, but do not influence those of us who have any sense of right, and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their fathers.
True.
Now, when a man is in this state, and the questioning spirit asks what is fair or honourable, and he answers as the legislator has taught him, and then arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he is driven into believing that nothing is honourable any more than dishonourable, or just and good any more than the reverse, and so of all the notions which he most valued, do you think that he will still honour and obey them as before?
Impossible.
And when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore, and he fails to discover the true, can he be expected to pursue any life other than that which flatters his desires?
He cannot.
And from being a keeper of the law he is converted into a breaker of it?
Unquestionably.
Now all this is very natural in students of philosophy such as I have described, and also, as I was just now saying, most excusable.
Yes, he said; and, I may add, pitiable.
Therefore, that your feelings may not be moved to pity about our citizens who are now thirty years of age, every care must be taken in introducing them to dialectic.
Certainly.
There is a danger lest they should taste the dear delight too early; for youngsters, as you may have observed, when they first get the taste in their mouths, argue for amusement, and are always contradicting and refuting others in imitation of those who refute them; like puppy-dogs, they rejoice in pulling and tearing at all who come near them.
Yes, he said, there is nothing which they like better.
And when they have made many conquests and received defeats at the hands of many, they violently and speedily get into a way of not believing anything which they believed before, and hence, not only they, but philosophy and all that relates to it is apt to have a bad name with the rest of the world.
Too true, he said.
But when a man begins to get older, he will no longer be guilty of such insanity; he will imitate the dialectician who is seeking for truth, and not the eristic, who is contradicting for the sake of amusement; and the greater moderation of his character will increase instead of diminishing the honour of the pursuit.
Very true, he said.
And did we not make special provision for this, when we said that the disciples of philosophy were to be orderly and steadfast, not, as now, any chance aspirant or intruder?
Very true.
Suppose, I said, the study of philosophy to take the place of gymnastics and to be continued diligently and earnestly and exclusively for twice the number of years which were passed in bodily exercise --will that be enough?
Would you say six or four years? he asked.
Say five years, I replied; at the end of the time they must be sent down again into the den and compelled to hold any military or other office which young men are qualified to hold: in this way they will get their experience of life, and there will be an opportunity of trying whether, when they are drawn all manner of ways by temptation, they will stand firm or flinch.
And how long is this stage of their lives to last?
Fifteen years, I answered; and when they have reached fifty years of age, then let those who still survive and have distinguished themselves in every action of their lives and in every branch of knowledge come at last to their consummation; the time has now arrived at which they must raise the eye of the soul to the universal light which lightens all things, and behold the absolute good; for that is the, pattern according to which they are to order the State and the lives of individuals, and the remainder of their own lives also; making philosophy their chief pursuit, but, when their turn comes, toiling also at politics and ruling for the public good, not as though they were performing some heroic action, but simply as a matter of duty; and when they have brought up in each generation others like themselves and left them in their place to be governors of the State, then they will depart to the Islands of the Blest and dwell there; and the city will give them public memorials and sacrifices and honour them, if the Pythian oracle consent, as demi-gods, but if not, as in any case blessed and divine.
You are a sculptor, Socrates, and have made statues of our governors faultless in beauty.
Yes, I said, Glaucon, and of our governesses too; for you must not suppose that what I have been saying applies to men only and not to women as far as their natures can go.
There you are right, he said, since we have made them to share in all things like the men.
Well, I said, and you would agree (would you not?) that what has been said about the State and the government is not a mere dream, and although difficult not impossible, but only possible in the way which has been supposed; that is to say, when the true philosopher kings are born in a State, one or more of them, despising the honours of this present world which they deem mean and worthless, esteeming above all things right and the honour that springs from right, and regarding justice as the greatest and most necessary of all things, whose ministers they are, and whose principles will be exalted by them when they set in order their own city?
How will they proceed?
They will begin by sending out into the country all the inhabitants of the city who are more than ten years old, and will take possession of their children, who will be unaffected by the habits of their parents; these they will train in their own habits and laws, I mean in the laws which we have given them: and in this way the State and constitution of which we were speaking will soonest and most easily attain happiness, and the nation which has such a constitution will gain most.
Yes, that will be the best way. And I think, Socrates, that you have very well described how, if ever, such a constitution might come into being.
Enough then of the perfect State, and of the man who bears its image --there is no difficulty in seeing how we shall describe him.
There is no difficulty, he replied; and I agree with you in thinking that nothing more need be said."

In my raps, there's unlimited lyrics and syllables

Every single day I'm feeling caught in the middle of a bomb and a missle on the block with a pistol
Running away from a dozen cops and officals who won't stop with the whistle but they not being civil
Thinking bout the rhymes that I could jot with a pencil on a hot instrumental
Oh, thought of a riddle, what's a lot of a little?
Cause I just want to hit the fucking lotto a little pray to God for a nickle

And now they start to double and double, and this shit's overwhelming but I gotta find an exit quick

You're too average to consider surpassing
The task is tedious, really, this beat is just feeding me
You thought Gonzalez was
I hate when they call me a fast rapper
Shame on you hate mongers heaping the praise on them fake frauds

O rebolado dessa gata balançou meu coração
Então tá bom, bem
Então soma, tira a prova, se envolve na aula
Só pra ter assunto, reprovo e resolvo no mundo
O babaca para perto, pede pra ir junto
São pique racional, numeral, dois conjunto

Ah, tätowierte Ghetto-Gs
Beef mit Familys, street wie NMDs
Schieß' auf Enemys, realste Rap-MC
Aber Fler verpfeift das Team wie Referees
Kill em all ich hab die guncollection
Boom boom boom boom, schwammconnection
Starte kein Twitterbeef, habe kein killermotiv aber uberlege mir nen grund sie einfach
Anzustechen

And then I'm ripping and ripping and ripping the mic, if some of them not giving not what they like
I'm picking a panel off when sprinting to write, hello, I'm just a fellow, just a kind-of mellow

Then I go, go, go, go, go
Every time I get a beat, I know I gotta beat it up
I bend it, then I break it, then I chop it, then I eat it up
And PETA would never approve of the way I've been treating the music
I bleed it, I bruise it, I kick it to the curb
And then I'm sipping on my bourbon, I be freaking it doing it, keeping it moving
I'm picking apart the muscle when I'm thinking about the hustle
But I'm nice, nice!
Hai!
This guy right here!
Credit to Reddit you bet I’ll never forget I’m forever indebted

Gonna meet up at a 7-Eleven to pick up a dank donut pack
I look at myself in the glass and go ‘Oh what?!’

And that’s how do it that mentality that I’m living with
When I’m spitting, there’s really ain’t no motherfucking punchline
When i be rocking the mic I be giving the niggas the business
And breaking them off with the lyrical heat and leaving with em this shit and be leaving em tongue tie!
It’s time for me fill ’em with venom and behead ’em up and I’ll chop ’em to bits
Better believe that I'm being on my level and never be ready for droppin’ this
You cut ’em with venom in head, I tell ’em you better be gettin’ ’em hustled I might of been beneath and fuckin’ around, I’ma take it to head with the medal and pop the Smith

Never been a counterfeit of nothing I am just an elevated
Entity I’m coming and giving it back and then pumping
Dump on every instrument with increments of syllables
And sentiments I lunge I’m livid again I’m sticking it in
Their muffins make a couple million I’m hoping to I’m going to
So gimme another reason I should sit around an not experience
Benefits of getting down when all the drivel that they’re spitting
Is so hideous Godzilla fear the viciousness!
Bitch, just because you work hard doesn't mean you get rich
But I'll be taking Michelle Bachman and sitting her down, sticking my dick in and licking and ticking and kicking her out

Top nobody choppers that be thinking that they got it, I'm the illest, don't forget it cause you know that I be popping
And my homies down to rock, I got a semi and I pop it
I'm the hottest, no one stop us, so impossible with godly flows
I cannot send the game, got the boulders in your brain
Now would you want to listen and just watch this music
Hittin their head and make music and then I will lunge drop a knife when I hit em and kill em and slither enemies hitting em up with the brain
Somebody chugging I'm baking it backing it send em look at the way you doing it making the money, making it final
Taking a buck kind of just want to change

Finna beat the instrumental like it was a denim

I knew the mommy was a goner
Papa never run away, now put the gun away
Before a bullet's put up in your fruit loop
I will eventually get to runnin’ whenever they make it impossible
Hit a motherfucker with the venom and I put ’em all up in the hospital
Do you want it with the funk, I’m grabbin’ a pump
And I be doin’ the voodoo
Deuce-deuce through your window
And I shoot two through your nostril
Fuck ’em all, hit ’em all, kill ’em all
I hate they whole clique though
Really you mad at me because your bitch on my dick, so
Hit her all up on the Facebook say ’hey, look, it’s Twisted Insane
Come give me brain’, so just hopped in my 6-4

Tutte le volte vado più forte mi diverto come nelle giostre non me ne fotte se non capisci
La potenza dell'extrabeat
Propongo delle proposte propositive che vi possono fare uscire davvero da tutta questa shit
Sclero voglio superare il cielo come un alieno gli scarsi nemmeno li vedo ai miracoli so
Che ci credo
Sono sereno pure se crolla il mondo intero mica come Svevo dopo che scrisse tutta quanta
La coscienza di Zeno
Di lato, di perfetta comprensione sparo parole calibro nove
Mitragliatore di precisione faccio musica di professione
Non mi interessa la protezione delle persone con la pressione e la propensione a camminare
Per ore come dentro una processione

Engo a darte un par de frases
De esas que me han dicho que no forman parte
Por cuidar mi diccion El Chojin comparte
Con todos los otros los que viven rap, o no??
No pretendo polemizar pero es que muchos mc´s no saben vocalizar
No los entiendo tienen huecos los textos
Si no tienes nada que hablar quedate en silencio
Yo! vengo a darte un par de frases
De esas que me han dicho que no forman parte
Por cuidar mi diccion El Chojin comparte
Con todos los otros los que viven rap, o no??
No pretendo polemizar pero es que muchos mc´s no saben vocalizar
No los entiendo tienen huecos los textos
Si no tienes nada que hablar quedate en silencio
Todos tienen derecho a hablar
Pero no nos castigues con tu basura de rap
Solo aprende a respetar cual es tu lugar
Y yo no te castigare con mi furia verbal
(Como!) Como quieres que la gente te oiga
Con esa lengua tan grande que no te cabe en la boca
En este club como en todos nos regimos por normas
La primera es que se entienda lo que dices SI IMPORTA!
Cada vez que me ves haciendo el papel
De mc contra el que resistirse equivale a perder
Debes comprender que para hacer esto bien
No solo es rimar que tambien hay que valer
Venga!!

You can feel the wrath of a menace from the beginning
Come against a type of nigga like me and I'm sinning
Better pray to God that you're in it to win it
Cause I get to rippin it like ain't nobody fuckin with it
Too egotistic, list it, raps theistic
Fuck, you missed it
Gotta couple loose screws in my head
So you better keep your distance
Keep a witness hit list
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
Innovative and I'm made of rubber, so that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating
Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevating music, you make elevator music

See, your heart rate is normal, your breathing is regular? and your body temperature is stable, et cetera
I have never seen somebody so healthy in my career as a doctor I'm telling ya (what?)
There's literally nothing I can give you, not a pill, not a drug nor an ointment
You ain't even bother making an appointment, this is nothing but a pure disappointment
Murder get set
The level of skill is how we determine respect
I would consider it a lyrical miracle the number of syllables
That are conserved in a breath like ya
I keep jerking em with the hundred clip
And deserve all of the ways that’d be practical
All they doing the same
You could’ a been the hottest rapper dead or alive
Never lie now they lie cause it just burnt to the death

My chopping ability's cavernous, taking a beat and going to ravage it
Having everybody wonder what's happening, unlimited energy's what I'm tapping in
A machine gun is popping a cap in it, locking the body up in the cabinent
Articulate and intricate when I'm ripping it, I gotta be fucking immaculate
I'm the executioner, welcome to my dungeon
I grab a spiked mace, gonna hit you with the bludgeon, if you're questioning why I do it
It's because I'm a speed demon, and I'm just answering the summons
Hit em with the double time, when I go and bust a rhyme, even with a couple lines, you are never touching mine, did ya hear that
When I go into gear,  I'm in a different tier, if you are alive after a meeting, you should count that as a lucky try
People are still sleeping on this dog like I'm Wei Shen, treating me like I'm little kid in the play pen, even though I'm wrecking
The competition, where they're lacking I'm packing, I'm whacking em all, anybody still doubt that I'm one of the best? Okay then

Sentimental when I be leaving em heavens upheaving while I be looking at them with a devilish look on my face!
Murder any motherfucker thinking the brnging it better, topping em all, poppin em all and I'm doing it for the cheddar
They give me money, then you thinkin it funny fucking em all up with the speed there ain't a motherfucker spittin thats better than me I'm steeping into ya path

It's really been a little minute since I had to rap fast, got to do it like a nazi man I'm bout to gas that
Killings in the Holocaust, then bomb end up in my backpack
But it's stupid hating bout to kill cause I'm a spaz man
Even though I'm tripping I'm an eighty on the adderal
Keeping me from writing but I guess I am the bad and all
Losing all my famine and I'm bout to roll just like a ball
People like the way that I be chopping, man I hate it all
Repeat, alright x2
Coming to get'em hit'em with my venom then ima be chopping them all into pieces!
Chopping a body cause im a killer so I do it with minimal reasons
Ripping'em up to illest chopper when I get up on the track!
Bout to be banging them all when I am ready to attack!
Then im tearing your body down to a molecular scale!
When the cops find your body it will already be pale!
Dumping the guts over the side into the bay, over the rail
Chopping off your head, and send it to your parents through the mail

Choppin em up and bustin em down like a demolition derby like im on a mission; special edition, mint condition cuz their hasnt been a thirsty nigga ta merk me wit lyrics
From the clearance isle gimmickin tryin to mimic this image yall better off packin a picnic wit a mortician bitches
(Free advice)
Packing semen of a demon being a heathen beating seeds in any region making a legion while I'm reading it like I'ma rapping yakkin Charles Manson
While I be given a reason for you to believe in I'm a beast beasting it every season teething and feasting feeding Off beats like I'm treating myself for my own personal satisfaction
Acting up acting out with the action with tactics putting tax on the verses im no freestyler my style isn't free febreezing it fresh with the way that I be serving up the motherfuking murder
When working overtime being a hard worker performing that lyrical serial killer horror Halloween when I'm on the scene making it reality Optimiz Prime sort of like a Transformer

Soha! Ostoba, én ha osztom az észt
A kosztomon élsz, ahogy kóstolod, posztod a face-en, nos, hogy a mosdóba mész
Most jön a mostoha rész: roskad a fostól a WC, robban a bél
Kinek fogsora ép és a mosolya szép, ahhoz gyors’ oda lépsz, rajta morzsolva szét
Meg jöhet az EPILEPSZIA!
Eleve tele van az agyam beteges elemekkel, amik elegye fekete
A szavak e mellett, amiket tekerek, akarom mondani, ennek a veleje
Annyira meredek, aki hall, berezel, pörög az agya, hogy szedek-e szereket
Kitör a háború, mindenki pánikol, para van, amikor a beton beremeg
Pedig én nem vagyok gonosz, ám a dolog, az, ami ideköt, elveszi eszemet
De nem a tipikus, piti kis emberek, hanem a lirika mitikus ereje
Apokaliptikus ennek a jellege, ""automatikusan nyerek"" a jelige
Dobogón topogó, veni, vedi, vici, valaki tehet-e valamit

Rising to another level demons try to injure any pride and confidence within my soul but I don't hear it
I'm gonna be getting back on the mic when I gotta be breaking and hitting them up with cynical venom be getting up in them bringing Armageddon to anybody thinking they wanna battle because everybody gotta be getting ready for the hyper radical damage when I'm rapping and bagging the beat I'm flipping and dropping and leaving everybody eradicated with a vengeance when I be dropping my syllables at a super sonic speed but hypothetically I'm super humanely gifted I get up on the microphone I gotta make them bleed packing and busting a gat attacking them niggas asking them what they gonna do I get up on the microphone hit them up with the venom by chopping breaking and chewing the rhythm when niggas think they ready to come against me I slam them on the ground like a gavel

Now I'm taking the mic and I'm rapping at venomous full speed
Gain the momentum and hit 'em with rhythm, I'm verbally making 'em all bleed
Dropping the sound in the waves and doing it fast, think all of you agreed
What am I doing now? So sick when velocity limits I exceed
And if somebody wanna run up I will turn him into piece of raw meat
I'ma now wondering how to write bars and then rap 'em to make it all complete
It's rather hard but when you put heart to that, it will be guaranteed
All of these syllables feeding me up and I'm chopping 'em up, so let's eat
Et away or stay and laugh 'cause I do it my way, I could not obey, give it up like they say, still living with doubt everyday though, day by day
But now I'm here, not anymore filled with fear and my speed massacres every single enemy
Making 'em wrecking and ringing and breaking 'em, packing the mic and I'm bringing it back and taking out wack and irregular, packing and bagging 'em, sick of them thinking they rocking and swagging, I'm making 'em bringing their agony

Because when you take a leak in the snow
You can always see the spot where the pee is yellow
He's like a Child, while a power type man
But he came at me with a bad act
Like ""Hey, I'm DNA"" and I was like OK
But if you think I give a shit kid then you got it backwards
So how bout you say yo name
That shit is old, so I getting mo', keep spitting cold, lyrics are tempt niggas fo'
So man hit the road, and don't come back, what makes you think that we want your raps
The fact we ain't even gotta bump your tracks, cause that shit is fat, and try to bust hold back
Sick of the mike and makin a rap while im stepin and pullin my hand then i forgettin them and pullin my enemies set them to a middle were then i send them to a way then im makin one of them get out of my sight

No sé qué tan bueno pueda ser que tenga esta capacidad
Pero cada VEZ yo siento, que tengo que ir más de prisa veloz
Soy el único que puede viajar al pasado o futuro con solo mi voz
Yo rompo todas las marcas los records, habidos y por haber
Tirando tan rápidamente que puedes sentir mí poder

Ipasok mo ang bote sa iyong puday
Don't you worry, bitch, babayaran pa kita
Marami akong pera wag mag-alala
Hoy pobre, magkaano ba ang iyong magulang?
Siguro naman ang isang milyon hindi kulang
Sasampalin ng pera't papadila ang pader

193,206204799,Airis (feat. DonMigs),Mooz PH,[15],['R&B/Soul'],"Fragment 1
I speak to those who lawfully may hear:
Depart all ye profane, and close the doors.
The thoughts of a wise theology, wherein men indicated God and God's powers by images akin to sense, and sketched invisible things in visible forms, I will show to those who have learned to read from the statues as from books the things there written concerning the gods. Nor is it any wonder that the utterly unlearned regard the statues as wood and stone, just as also those who do not understand the written letters look upon the monuments as mere stones, and on the tablets as bits of wood, and on books as woven papyrus.
Fragment 2
As the deity is of the nature of light, and dwells in an atmosphere of ethereal fire, and is invisible to sense that is busy about mortal life, He through translucent matter, as crystal or Parian marble or even ivory, led men on to the conception of his light, and through material gold to the discernment of the fire, and to his undefiled purity, because gold cannot be defiled.
On the other hand, black marble was used by many to show his invisibility; and they moulded their gods in human form because the deity is rational, and made these beautiful, because in those is pure and perfect beauty; and in varieties of shape and age, of sitting and standing, and drapery; and some of them male, and some female, virgins, and youths, or married, to represent their diversity.
Hence they assigned everything white to the gods of heaven, and the sphere and all things spherical to the cosmos and to the sun and moon in particular, but sometimes also to fortune and to hope: and the circle and things circular to eternity, and to the motion of the heaven, and to the zones and cycles therein; and the segments of circles to the phases of the moon; pyramids and obelisks to the element of fire, and therefore to the gods of Olympus; so again the cone to the sun, and cylinder to the earth, and figures representing parts of the human body to sowing and generation.
Fragment 3
'Now look at the wisdom of the Greeks, and examine it as follows. The authors of the Orphic hymns supposed Zeus to be the mind of the world, and that he created all things therein,containing the world in himself. Therefore in their theological systems they have handed down their opinions concerning him thus:'
Zeus was the first, Zeus last, the lightning's lord,
Zeus head, Zeus centre, all things are from Zeus.
Zeus born a male, Zeus virgin undefiled;
Zeus the firm base of earth and starry heaven;
Zeus sovereign, Zeus alone first cause of all:
One power divine, great ruler of the world,
One kingly form, encircling all things here,
Fire, water, earth, and ether, night and day;
Wisdom, first parent, and delightful Love:
For in Zeus' mighty body these all lie.
His head and beauteous face the radiant heaven
Reveals and round him float in shining waves
The golden tresses of the twinkling stars.
On either side bulls' horns of gold are seen,
Sunrise and sunset, footpaths of the gods.
His eyes the Sun, the Moon's responsive light;
His mind immortal ether, sovereign truth,
Hears and considers all; nor any speech,
Nor cry, nor noise, nor ominous voice escapes
The ear of Zeus, great Kronos' mightier son:
Such his immortal head, and such his thought.
His radiant body, boundless, undisturbed
In strength of mighty limbs was formed thus:
The god's broad-spreading shoulders, breast and back
Air's wide expanse displays; on either side
Grow wings, wherewith throughout all space he flies.
Earth the all-mother, with her lofty hills,
His sacred belly forms; the swelling flood
Of hoarse resounding Ocean girds his waist.
His feet the deeply rooted ground upholds,
And dismal Tartarus, and earth's utmost bounds.
All things he hides, then from his heart again
In godlike action brings to gladsome light.
Zeus, therefore, is the whole world, animal of animals, and god of gods; but Zeus, that is, inasmuch as he is the mind from which he brings forth all things, and by his thoughts creates them. When the theologians had explained the nature of god in this manner, to make an image such as their description indicated was neither possible, nor, if any one thought of it, could he show the look of life, and intelligence, and forethought by the figure of a sphere.
But they have made the representation of Zeus in human form, because mind was that according to which he wrought, and by generative laws brought all things to completion; and he is seated, as indicating the steadfastness of his power: and his upper parts are bare, because he is manifested in the intellectual and the heavenly parts of the world; but his feet are clothed, because he is invisible in the things that lie hidden below. And he holds his sceptre in his left hand, because most close to that side of the body dwells the heart, the most commanding and intelligent organ: for the creative mind is the sovereign of the world. And in his right hand he holds forth either an eagle, because he is master of the gods who traverse the air, as the eagle is master of the birds that fly aloft - or a victory, because he is himself victorious over all things.
Fragment 4
They have made Hera the wife of Zeus, because they called the ethereal and aerial power Hera. For the ether is a very subtle air.
Fragment 5
And the power of the whole air is Hera, called by a name derived from the air: but the symbol of the sublunar air which is affected by light and darkness is Leto; for she is oblivion caused by the insensibility in sleep, and because souls begotten below the moon are accompanied by forgetfulness of the Divine; and on this account she is also the mother of Apollo and Artemis, who are the sources of light for the night.
Fragment 6
The ruling principle of the power of earth is called Hestia, of whom a statue representing her as a virgin is usually set up on the hearth; but inasmuch as the power is productive, they symbolize her by the form of a woman with prominent breasts. The name Rhea they gave to the power of rocky and mountainous land, and Demeter to that of level and productive land. Demeter in other respects is the same as Rhea, but differs in the fact that she gives birth to Kore by Zeus, that is, she produces the shoot from the seeds of plants. And on this account her statue is crowned with ears of corn, and poppies are set round her as a symbol of productiveness.
Fragment 7
But since there was in the seeds cast into the earth a certain power, which the sun in passing round to the lower hemisphere drags down at the time of the winter solstice, Kore is the seminal power, and Pluto the sun passing under the earth, and traversing the unseen world at the time of the winter solstice; and he is said to carry off Kore, who, while hidden beneath the earth, is lamented by her mother Demeter.
The power which produces hard-shelled fruits, and the fruits of plants in general, is named Dionysus. But observe the images of these also. For Kore bears symbols of the production of the plants which grow above the earth in the crops: and Dionysus has horns in common with Kore, and is of female form, indicating the union of male and female forces in the generation of the hard shelled fruits.
But Pluto, the ravisher of Kore, has a helmet as a symbol of the unseen pole, and his shortened sceptre as an emblem of his kingdom of the nether world; and his dog indicates the generation of the fruits in its threefold division - the sowing of the seed, its reception by the earth, its growing up. For he is called a dog, not because souls are his food, but because of the earth's fertility, for which Pluto provides when he carries off Kore.
Attis, too, and Adonis are related to the analogy of fruits. Attis is the symbol of the blossoms which appear early in the spring, and fall off before the complete fertilization; whence they further attributed castration to him, from the fruits not having attained to seminal perfection: but Adonis was the symbol of the cutting of the perfect fruits.
Silenus was the symbol of the wind's motion, which contributes no few benefits to the world. And the flowery and brilliant wreath upon his head is symbolic of the revolution of the heaven, and the hair with which his lower limbs are surrounded is an indication of the density of the air near the earth.
Since there was also a power partaking of the prophetic faculty, the power is called Themis, because of its telling what is appointed and fixed for each person.
In all these ways, then, the power of the earth finds an interpretation and is worshipped: as a virgin and Hestia, she holds the centre; as a mother she nourishes; as Rhea she makes rocks and dwells on mountains; as Demeter, she produces herbage; and as Themis, she utters oracles: while the seminal law which descends into her bosom is figured as Priapus, the influence of which on dry crops is called Kore, and on soft fruits and shellfruits is called Dionysus. For Kore was carried off by Pluto, that is, the sun going; down beneath the earth at seed-time; but Dionysus begins to sprout according to the conditions of the power which, while young, is hidden beneath the earth, yet produces fine fruits, and is an ally of the power in the blossom symbolized by Attis, and of the cutting of the ripened corn symbolized by Adonis.
Also the power of the wind which pervades all things is formed into a figure of Silenus, and the perversion to frenzy into a figure of a Bacchante, as also the impulse which excites to lust is represented by the Satyrs. These, then, are the symbols by which the power of the earth is revealed.
Fragment 8
The whole power productive of water they called Oceanus, and named its symbolic figure Tethys. But of the whole, the drinking-water produced is called Achelous; and the sea-water Poseidon; while again that which makes the sea, inasmuch as it is productive, is Amphitrite. Of the sweet waters the particular powers are called Nymphs, and those of the sea-waters Nereids.
Again, the power of fire they called Hephaestus, and have made his image in the form of a man, but put on it a blue cap as a symbol of the revolution of the heavens, because the archetypal and purest form of fire is there. But the fire brought down from heaven to earth is less intense, and wants the strengthening and support which is found in matter: wherefore he is lame, as needing matter to support him.
Also they supposed a power of this kind to belong to the sun and called it Apollo, from the pulsation of his beams. There are also nine Muses singing to his lyre, which are the sublunar sphere, and seven spheres of the planets, and one of the fixed stars. And they crowned him with laurel, partly because the plant is full of fire, and therefore hated by daemons; and partly because it crackles in burning, to represent the god's prophetic art.
But inasmuch as the sun wards off the evils of the earth, they called him Heracles (from his clashing against the air) in passing from east to west. And they invented fables of his performing twelve labours, as the symbol of the division of the signs of the zodiac in heaven; and they arrayed him with a club and a lion's skin, the one as an indication of his uneven motion, and the other representative of his strength in ""Leo"" the sign of the zodiac.
Of the sun's healing power Asclepius is the symbol, and to him they have given the staff as a sign of the support and rest of the sick, and the serpent is wound round it, as significant of his preservation of body and soul: for the animal is most full of spirit, and shuffles off the weakness of the body. It seems also to have a great faculty for healing: for it found the remedy for giving clear sight, and is said in a legend to know a certain plant which restores life.
But the fiery power of his revolving and circling motion, whereby he ripens the crops, is called Dionysus, not in the same sense as the power which produces the juicy fruits, but either from the sun's rotation, or from his completing his orbit in the heaven. And whereas he revolves round the cosmical seasons and is the maker of ""times and tides,"" the sun is on this account called Horus.
Of his power over agriculture, whereon depend the gifts of wealth, the symbol is Pluto. He has, however, equally the power of destroying, on which account they make Sarapis share the temple of Pluto: and the purple tunic they make the symbol of the light that has sunk beneath the earth, and the sceptre broken at the top that of his power below, and the posture of the hand the symbol of his departure into the unseen world.
Cerberus is represented with three heads, because the positions of the sun above the earth are three-rising, midday, and setting.
The moon, conceived according to her brightness, they called Artemis, as it were, ""cutting the air."" And Artemis, though herself a virgin, presides over childbirth, because the power of the new moon is helpful to parturition.
What Apollo is to the sun, that Athena is to the moon: for the moon is a symbol of wisdom, and so a kind of Athena.
But, again, the moon is Hecate, the symbol of her varying phases and of her power dependent on the phases. Wherefore her power appears in three forms, having as symbol of the new moon the figure in the white robe and golden sandals, and torches lighted: the basket, which she bears when she has mounted high, is the symbol of the cultivation of the crops, which she makes to grow up according to the increase of her light: and again the symbol of the full moon is the goddess of the brazen sandals.
Or even from the branch of olive one might infer her fiery nature, and from the poppy her productiveness, and the multitude of the souls who find an abode in her as in a city, for the poppy is an emblem of a city. She bears a bow, like Artemis, because of the sharpness of the pangs of labour.
And, again, the Fates are referred to her powers, Clotho to the generative, and Lachesis to the nutritive, and Atropos to the inexorable will of the deity.
Also, the power productive of corn-crops, which is Demeter, they associate with her, as producing power in her. The moon is also a supporter of Kore. They set Dionysus also beside her, both on account of their growth of horns, and because of the region of clouds lying beneath the lower world.
The power of Kronos they perceived to be sluggish and slow and cold, and therefore attributed to him the power of time: and they figure him standing, and grey-headed, to indicate that time is growing old.
The Curetes, attending on Chronos, are symbols of the seasons, because time journeys on through seasons.
Of the Hours, some are the Olympian, belonging to the sun, which also open the gates in the air: and others are earthly, belonging to Demeter, and hold a basket, one symbolic of the flowers of spring, and the other of the wheat-ears of summer.
The power of Ares they perceived to be fiery, and represented it as causing war and bloodshed, and capable both of harm and benefit.
The star of Aphrodite they observed as tending to fecundity, being the cause of desire and offspring, and represented it as a woman because of generation, and as beautiful, because it is also the evening star -
""Hesper, the fairest star that shines in heaven."" 
And Eros they set by her because of desire. She veils her breasts and other parts, because their power is the source of generation and nourishment. She comes from the sea, a watery element, and warm, and in constant movement, and foaming because of its commotion, whereby they intimate the seminal power.
Hermes is the representative of reason and speech, which both accomplish and interpret all things. The phallic Hermes represents vigour, but also indicates the generative law that pervades all things.
Further, reason is composite: in the sun it is called Hermes; in the moon Hecate; and that which is in the All Hermopan, for the generative and creative reason extends over all things. Hermanubis also is composite, and as it were half Greek, being found among the Egyptians also. Since speech is also connected with the power of love, Eros represents this power: wherefore Eros is represented as the son of Hermes, but as an infant, because of his sudden impulses of desire.
They made Pan the symbol of the universe, and gave him his horns as symbols of sun and moon, and the fawn skin as emblem of the stars in heaven, or of the variety of the universe.
Fragment 10
The Demiurge, whom the Egyptians call Cneph, is of human form, but with a skin of dark blue, holding a girdle and a sceptre, and crowned with a royal wing on his head, because reason is hard to discover, and wrapt up in secret, and not conspicuous, and because it is life-giving, and because it is a king, and because it has an intelligent motion: wherefore the characteristic wing is put upon his head.
This god, they say, puts forth from his mouth an egg, from which is born a god who is called by themselves Phtha, but by the Greeks Hephaestus; and the egg they interpret as the world. To this god the sheep is consecrated, because the ancients used to drink milk.
The representation of the world itself they figured thus: the statue is like a man having feet joined together, and clothed from head to foot with a robe of many colours, and has on the head a golden sphere, the first to represent its immobility, the second the many-coloured nature of the stars, and the third because the world is spherical.
The sun they indicate sometimes by a man embarked on a ship, the ship set on a crocodile. And the ship indicates the sun's motion in a liquid element: the crocodile potable water in which the sun travels. The figure of the sun thus signified that his revolution takes place through air that is liquid and sweet.
The power of the earth, both the celestial and terrestrial earth, they called Isis, because of the equality, which is the source of justice: but they call the moon the celestial earth, and the vegetative earth, on which we live, they call the terrestrial.
Demeter has the same meaning among the Greeks as Isis amongs the Egyptians: and, again, Kore and Dionysus among the Greeks the same as Isis and Osiris among the Egyptians. Isis is that which nourishes and raises up the fruits of the earth; and Osiris among the Egyptians is that which supplies the fructifying power, which they propitiate with lamentations as it disappears into the earth in the sowing, and as it is consumed by us for food.
Osiris is also taken for the river-power of the Nile: when, however, they signify the terrestrial earth, Osiris is taken as the fructifying power; but when the celestial, Osiris is the Nile, which they suppose to come down from heaven: this also they bewail, in order to propitiate the power when failing and becoming exhausted. And the Isis who, in the legends, is wedded to Osiris is the land of Egypt, and therefore she is made equal to him, and conceives, and produces the fruits; and on this account Osiris has been described by tradition as the husband of Isis, and her brother, and her son.
At the city Elephantine there is an image worshipped, which in other respects is fashioned in the likeness of a man and sitting; it is of a blue colour, and has a ram's head, and a diadem bearing the horns of a goat, above which is a quoit-shaped circle. He sits with a vessel of clay beside him, on which he is moulding the figure of a man. And from having the face of a ram and the horns of a goat he indicates the conjunction of sun and moon in the sign of the Ram, while the colour of blue indicates that the moon in that conjunction brings rain.
The second appearance of the moon is held sacred in the city of Apollo: and its symbol is a man with a hawk-like face, subduing with a hunting-spear Typhon in the likeness of a hippopotamus. The image is white in colour, the whiteness representing the illumination of the moon, and the hawk-like face the fact that it derives light and breath from the sun. For the hawk they consecrate to the sun, and make it their symbol of light and breath, because of its swift motion, and its soaring up on high, where the light is. And the hippopotamus represents, the Western sky, because of its swallowing up into itself the stars which traverse it.
In this city Horus is worshipped as a god. But the city of Eileithyia worships the third appearance of the moon: and her statue is fashioned into a flying vulture, whose plumage consists of precious stones. And its likeness to a vulture signifies that the moon is what produces the winds: for they think that the vulture conceives from the wind, and declares that they are all hen birds.
In the mysteries at Eleusis the hierophant is dressed up to represent the demiurge, and the torch-bearer the sun, the priest at the altar the moon, and the sacred herald Hermes.
Moreover a man is admitted by the Egyptians among their objects of worship. For there is a village in Egypt called Anabis, in which a man is worshipped, and sacrifice offered to him, and the victims burned upon his altars: and after a little while he would eat the things that had been prepared for him as for a man.
They did not, however, believe the animals to be gods, but regarded them as likenesses and symbols of gods; and this is shown by the fact that in many places oxen dedicated to the gods are sacrificed at their monthly festivals and in their religious services. For they consecrated oxen to the sun and moon.
The ox called Mnevis which is dedicated to the sun in Heliopolis, is the largest of oxen, very black, chiefly because much sunshine blackens men's bodies. And its tail and all its body are covered with hair that bristles backwards unlike other cattle, just as the sun makes its course in the opposite direction to the heaven. Its testicles are very large, since desire is produced by heat, and the sun is said to fertilize nature.
To the moon they dedicated a bull which they call Apis, which also is more black than others, and bears symbols of sun and moon, because the light of the moon is from the sun. The blackness of his body is an emblem of the sun, and so is the beetle-like mark under his tongue; and the symbol of the moon is the semicircle, and the gibbous figure."

My control of grammar’s leaving other rappers with a stammer
Mind your manners, I could turn my competition to cadavers
The King of Rap is here to fucking take my throne
Came alone
Fuck the beat and path, Ashtin made his own
This game's my home, 'bout to make some renovations
Rap God's Second Coming: check the Book of Revelations
Wait, I'm mistaken
I'm New Jersey's patron saint in saying shit to shake these old white people across the nation
If I offend you, it's probably cause I intend to
I hope I piss you off with all this noise that I've been making
Fuck you
I’m the Jersey Devil, I’m the Jersey Devil
These other motherfuckers just ain’t on my level
I’m the Jersey Devil, I’m the Jersey Devil
On the highway to Hell, press the fucking pedal
I’m the Jersey Devil, I’m the Jersey Devil
These other motherfuckers just ain’t on my level
I’m the Jersey Devil, I’m the Jersey Devil
On the highway to Hell, press the fucking pedal"

Dolce Gabbana, jalois on Prada, soossi, valuu, niinku tukotettu hana
Dolce, makee, lempee, leivos
Pidä vaa sun yayos ja ne kepulikeinos
Mä otin sun, tein siitä mun
Sä otit mun, mä otin sun
Se anto pusun, mis Ilmari-Kun (mis ilmari-kun)
Ku mä puhun, ne tietää huhun
Ei liity muhun ei liity muhun
Meitsi nii fly, ennen ku lavalle meen
Laitan päälle pilottipuvun
Silmäni ku trung, kiipeän puuhun
Banaani suuhun, mut kilisee vaa massi
 lisäsin mun tilille toisen luvun
Tu-Tun, sulla on boring, meillä on fun
Sulla on sadetta meillä on sun
Ja ku mä puhun, se lisää lompakkoon luvun
Taskut on täynnä rahaa, ne sanoo et Fuge on täynna pahaa uu yaa; saggin my jeans et Evisun lahkeet mun takan laahaa
Riisii ja kanaa, Iben safka täyttää mun mahaa
Aaron on stadissa, Koffissa makaa
Tämä on stickup niinku, kendama

Mä teen rahaa kun mä puhun, ey
Mä teen rahaa kun mä nukun, huh
Tulin mä tekemään tukun, hmm
Mulla on messis koko suku, yah, yah, yah
Jalassa mulla on J’s salassa pidän mun cheessit, ay
Kaulassa mulla on mummoni antama äitini kantama Jesus piece
Lickity split, Rolexi sanoo vaa tic, muijan pitää olla thick
Broidin kaa kokattii brick, ulkosalla liikaa nytten Fuego on nii sick
Sick Sick Sick uu, päällä on Ricky ja muija on thicki ku Nicki
Tossa on pyyhe mä nään sul on hiki, oota mä hittaan tän lickin
Ibellä Ricky, mulla on Raf, niinku Kevin sanon blääf
Mul on pankki sul on stash, nää haluu mut pois niinku rash
Jengi kutisee ku rokos, äijä sun tyyli on Sokos
Ratikas safkaan vaa tacos, aina vaa töis ei ikinä lakos

Mä teen rahaa kun mä puhun, ey
Mä teen rahaa kun mä nukun, huh
Tulin mä tekemään tukun, hmm
Mulla on messis koko suku, yah, yah, yah
Mä teen rahaa kun mä puhun, ey
Mä teen rahaa kun mä nukun, huh
Tulin mä tekemään tukun, hmm
Mulla on messis koko suku, yah, yah, yah"
